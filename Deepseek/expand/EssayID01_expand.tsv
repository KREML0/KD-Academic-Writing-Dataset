1	1	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think the effects computers have on people are great learning skills and positive affects because they give us time to chat with friends and new people, helps us learn about the globe like astronomy, and keeps us out of trouble! Just think about it! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever have time to chat with your friends or business partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat: the computer. Theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so like @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, Facebook, and Myspace, etc. Just think, now while you're setting up a meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys or states outside of yours? Well I have by computer and internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them some question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's and you'll be surprise at how much he or she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much more interesting then being in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being peer pressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbid, in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. It is better to have your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or a community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or your child as it gives us time to chat with friends and new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of trouble. Thank you for listening.
2	2	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that using computers will benefit us in many ways like talking and becoming friends with others through websites like Facebook and Myspace. Using computers can help us find coordinates, locations, and avail ourselves to millions of pieces of information. Also computers will benefit us by helping with jobs such as planning a house plan and typing a @NUM1 page report for one of our jobs in less time than writing it by hand. Now lets go into the wonderful world of technology. Using a computer will help us in life by talking or making friends on line. Many people have Myspace, Facebook, or AIM; these all benefit us by having conversations with one another. Many people believe computers are bad but how can you make friends if you can never talk to them? I am very fortunate for having a computer that can help with not only school work but my social life and how I make friends. Computers help us with finding our locations, coordinates and millions of information online. If we didn't go on the internet a lot we wouldn't know how to go onto websites that @MONTH1 help us with locations and coordinates like @LOCATION1. Would you rather use a computer or be in @LOCATION3 when you're supposed to be vacationing in @LOCATION2? Millions of information is found on the internet. You can ask almost every question and a computer will have it. Would you rather easily draw up a house plan on the computer or take @NUM1 hours doing one by hand with ugly eraser marks all over it? You are not guaranteed to find a job with a drawing like that. Also when applying for a job many workers must write very long papers like a @NUM3 word essay on why this job fits you the most, and many people I know don't like writing @NUM3 words non-stop for hours when it could take them less time on a computer. That is why computers are needed a lot nowadays. I hope this essay has impacted your decision on computers because they are great machines to work with. The other day I showed my mom how to use a computer and she said it was the greatest invention since sliced bread! Now go out and buy a computer to help you chat online with friends, find locations and millions of information on one click of the button and help your self with getting a job with neat, prepared, printed work that your boss will love.
3	3	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Others have different ideas. A great amount of people in the world today are using computers, some for work and some for the fun of it. Computers are one of man's greatest accomplishments. Computers are helpful in so many ways, providing access to @CAPS4, news, and live streams. Don't get me wrong, way too many people spend time on the computer and they should be out interacting with others but who are we to tell them what to do. When I grow up I want to be an author or a journalist and I know for a fact that both of those jobs involve lots of time on the computer, one @MONTH1 spend more time then the other but you know exactly what @CAPS5 is getting at. So what if some experts think people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. For all the expert knows, that is how most people make a living and we don't know why people choose to use the computer for a great amount of time and to be honest it's none of my concern and it shouldn't be the so called experts' concern. People interact a thousand times a day on the computers. Computers keep lots of kids off the streets instead of being out and causing trouble. Computers helps the @ORGANIZATION1 locate most wanted criminals. As you can see computers are more useful to society then you might think, and they ultimately benefit society in many significant ways.
4	4	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benefit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person, computers can get really close; such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for research or to help find good books. Also online catalogues or advertisements help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers, most of the modern world would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event I go to is planned on a computer by communication such as e-mail. @CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because they are out sick or needs help studying for a test, they can contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them, often e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be impossible to get mail to our customers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the modern communication abilities that computer provide us. Because information can be communicated so quick, so can research. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a poll, @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of research; of those, @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1, @PERCENT5 of people used computers for reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grades. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not possible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online, I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you imagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 days after the events occur. Most business, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalogue because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the customer's convenience. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their start to potential customers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her restaurant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the internet, @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion, computers help everyday people and without them most conveniences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people research subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation, computers are the most useful tool out there for modern life."
5	5	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I know having computers has a positive effect on people. The computers connect families, contain information which is great for peoples education, and are very convenient. Computers are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it. First off the internet or e-mail will help family members connect. My family, which lives @NUM1 hours away by car, love to talk with me by e-mail. This helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computers. Another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game, it would just be easier to go online to find it. This way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game. The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online. On the internet the family could find the numbers, the address and some information about it. This way more and more families can do activities together. As one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together. Another reason why the computers are good for society is education. With information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn. Now a days people try to find things out, but with all the tools on the computers it makes people get the education. Secondly computers are another way to go to college. If you aren't up to going to school or college because you're sick, you wouldn't have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed. Lastly everyone knows that in @LOCATION2 most classrooms can't afford one computer. The children want computers so hard. If they were to get one it would change so much. They would be able to learn so much more than before. The children could learn about different countries far away. As a result computers would improve the way we learn. The last reason why computers are so helpful is convenience. Now a days the world is crazy, so if we don't have to go out or talk to someone we won't. The computer will offer the ability to conference with other people so that there would be communication between work partners. With the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation. This is only one of the many reasons computers are very convenient; subsequently computers are convenient because you could book flights, vacations, rentals, and much more. With a click of a button you should be going to @CAPS1 or on a nice vacation, making life simpler and more connected for everyone.
6	6	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I think that computers have a negative affect on us! How many people have acess to a camputer daily in america.. @NUM1 and how many people go on at least an hour a @NUM2. That means that @NUM3 people cant exercise are wasting many are have the posibility of physical @CAPS1 that sound good to you? Think of everything you done when you write a letter. I got up and got all the materials and sit back down. After In done writing have to put all the materials away and then put the letter in the mailbox and walk all the way back. Well this is what I had to do. Now think how you write an email sitdown and move your fingers. Do you see the difference? @CAPS2 instead of getting a good walk to your friends house to talk to you just in him/er. Did you know that you can literally but from on your computer. Instead of around with this that can add anything you your computer gives away information they information lead to that and then everthing you have wouldbe gone. All this so you can go online. Believe it or not, you can phisically get hurt for being on the computer, to long. @NUM4 thing is that when you at a computer @CAPS2 what happened to my grandpa is that when you are in a wood chair all day you can get ardthritis in your muscle @CAPS3 thing that can happen is you can get a headache from staring at the bright screen for too many hours without a proper break to rest your eyes and your mind.
7	7	1	3	Did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety, natural education, and their social life? In my opinion, the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society. Initially, ones safety while using a computer is at risk. To begin, when someone is talking to another on a computer, they @MONTH1 never know who is at the other end of it. For example, @CAPS1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a predator. She will never know unless they meet us somewhere. At this point, it maybe too late. Moreover, studies show that @PERCENT1 of people's information is more widely exposed in the last @NUM1 years due to the new chat websites. Such as myspace and facebook. In these websites, people share their information. With this, their safety is at risk. Finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety safe. Furthermore, enjoying nature is a must, in our world full of immense landscapes, wide waters, dense forests, and lush valleys. @CAPS1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world, you should cease this use. One must actually be outside, experiencing the feel, the smell, and even the taste of nature. A recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a @NUM1 page essay on what they had learned. The people who didn't go and simply read information off their computer, could not write this much. Finally, society needs to back away from their computers, and stop into. Thirdly, a person's social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons. One reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends. Sure, you can chat with people online, but that's nothing like chatting in person. There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online, when you could do it in person. Finally, @CAPS1 someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer, it is there forever. Thus, you can lose friends, whether you're the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on. With this, you can easily ruin your family/social life by using your computer too often. How would you feel @CAPS1 it was your fault that someone's safety is at risk? Wouldn't you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect? Couldn't you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society. I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life.
8	8	1	3	"@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the feild? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. Hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there."" said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never!"
9	9	1	3	"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and ""boom,"" instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, ""@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future."
10	10	1	3	In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?
11	11	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 people acknowledge the great advances that computers give us, but they also put us at @CAPS1 disadvantages. Computers have been known to help develop health issues, such as eye strain and repetitive strain injuries from prolonged use. As people become more intune with the online world, they tend to interact with their family less, leading to a breakdown in communication. Don't forget the danger of online predators - they're deadly and can easily disguise their identities. @CAPS1 people who do nothing, but watch television are often refered to as cauch potatoes. Those who are glued to their computer screens are no better, leading similarly sedentary lifestyles. It is stated by numerous of @LOCATION2's top doctors that too much time spent on the computer can cause damage to your health, including poor posture and sleep disturbances. Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm, which does little for cardiovascular health. They can submerge themselves into obesity from constant sitting and snacking. This often causes depression as it begins to sink in and they feel isolated from the real world. Addition itself is a serious health issue, comparable to substance abuse. I wouldn't be surprised if they add a computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future to treat this modern dependency. These problems are slowly spreading and we must come together to abolish them through awareness and moderation! Family time is an treasured value, to the @CAPS2 people, but lately, computers are ruining this tradition by creating digital barriers within the home. With so @CAPS1 people absorbed with online drama, friends, and even video games, family interaction is declining significantly. People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace, neglecting their real-life relationships. They @MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat, scarcely resting their eyes or engaging with others. This can cause great tension or sorrow in @CAPS1 families, as loved ones feel ignored and unimportant. Who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever, using sophisticated tactics to groom their victims. Your children could be talking to someone they believe is another teenager looking for a friend to console in when, really, they are a forty-year-old serial killer waiting to find the right time to attack. Studies show that one fourth of online users have had an encounter with a dangerous person, highlighting the pervasive nature of this threat. We must remain vigilant and educate our children about these very real dangers to keep them safe.
12	12	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I feel that computers do take away from peoples life and arenít as important than the other factors of life. First of all you know that the world is becoming obease because of lack of exercise, a problem exacerbated by screen time. Also people don't realize that @CAPS3 warming is becomeing a big problum, accelerated by our energy consumption. Finally familys arn't as close as they used to be, often because members are distracted by devices. these are all the reasons why computers arn't important to human socioty. First of the world is becomeing obease and cumputers play a huge part in this by encouraging inactivity. Computers don't make people exercise they basicly just sit down on there couch and use the computer this won't help amarica get back into shape or improve national fitness levels. Also computers become a habbit if a person uses a computer everyday of there life it will become an addiction then they won't be able to stop using it even when they want to. Finally when people use the computer they don't realize the lack exersise there getting, which harms their long-term health. This is the first reason why computeres are a bad thing. Next @CAPS3 warming is mealting the polar ice caps at an alarming rate. Computers play a part in @CAPS3 warming because they use electricty and thjen the electrisity melts the polar ice caps through the emission of greenhouse gases. If this keeps happining then they will all melt and we will not have a shorline and half of the world will be fluded, causing massive displacement. Finally computers play a huge part in @CAPS3 warming because of the fact that they are so popular and their production and use consume vast amounts of energy. This is another reason why computers are bad for our planet. Finally the last reason why computers are bad is because they take away from your family life and create emotional distance. For instance there are more and more familys splitting up now and sientest sat that @PERCENT1 of the time it's because of technolagy like computers causing disagreements. When on peroson is on the computer the other people feel that they love the computer more than they love themselfs, leading to feelings of neglect. Then they split up for good, unable to reconcile their differences. This is the last reason why I feel computers are bad for relationships. In conclution you can see that computeres are a bad thing for several major reasons. First of all you can see that amarica is becomeing obease because of the computers promoting a sedentary lifestyle. Also computers are causeing @CAPS3 warming and are eventually goung to flood the earth if left unchecked. And last but not least computers take away from peoples family life and cause them to split up and become unhappy, destroying the family unit. These are all the compelling reasons why computers are bad for society.
13	13	1	3	Dear local newspaper I raed ur argument on the computers and I think they are a positive effect on people. The first reson I think they are a good effect is because you can do so much with them like if you live in mane and ur cuzin lives in califan you and him could have a wed chat and see each other face-to-face, bridging the distance. The second thing you could do is look up news any were in the world instantly, keeping you informed. You could be stuck on a plane and it would be vary boring when you can take but ur computer and go on ur computer at work and start doing work, increasing productivity. When you said it takes away from exirsis well some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat, using fitness apps to track their health. The thrid reson is some peolpe jobs are on the computers or making computers, which are essential careers. For exmple when you made this artical you didnt use a type writer you used a computer and printed it out, demonstrating their utility. If we didnt have computers it would make ur @CAPS1 a lot harder and less efficient in many tasks. Thank you for reading and whe you are thinking adout it agen pleas consiter my thrie resons for why computers are beneficial to modern life and communication.

15	15	1	3	Dear, In this world today we should have everyone useing computers because of their many benefits. Computers have a positive effect on people and their development. They teach hand-eye coordination through interactive games and tasks, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people through virtual tours, and even allow people to talk online with other people across the globe. Today computers are like the worlds biggest book of knowledge, containing vast information. everything you need to know is in a computer, accessible with a few clicks. You can look up faraway places, and zap theres everything you need to know write in front of you, making learning engaging. Computers are fast and easy, everyone can use them with a little practice. Today kids are so addicted to computers everyday they are on them, exploring new ideas. There are so many websites that kids and teens go on, like @CAPS1, and facebook ect., which facilitate social connection. on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures, sharing their lives. Thers is also webchat websites that allow you to use a webcame and talk to people anywhere in the world, making the world smaller. Computers are a great way to get in touch with people, maintaining relationships over long distances. Everyone should have a computer in there home today to access these incredible resources and opportunities for growth and connection.
16	16	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have filled one with this priceless information and human interaction. Computers are a necessity of life if society wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is used to excel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like typing can build up this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, ""@CAPS3 and computer games strengthen the brain. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands."" Improved hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wants to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. In reality, computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it. Additionally, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to research @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search and information would be presented to them instantly, allowing them to search through countless things. Also, having the ability to learn about cultures can make people more tolerant; when they understand other people and their cultures, they understand others better. Computers are a resourceful tool that can help people in every different aspect of life. Lastly, computer advancements in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help connect all different nations. Being on good terms with places other than our own can help us understand world events; when a story comes out about something that happened in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can access family members you scarcely visit. It can help you connect within your own family more. Obviously, computers are a useful aid in today's era; their advancements push the world forward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technological advancements. The world would be sectored and not unified, contact between people would be scarce, and information would be limited. The internet is like thousands of libraries put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of place you want people to live in?"
17	17	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people's lives. I believe this because people who spend too much time on the computer don't get out as much as they should, don't spend enough time with their family, and the computer can't do everything. My first reason is I believe that people need to get out more. When they don't get out, they don't exercise and that is very unhealthy. Instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game. I also believe that they should enjoy nature because I feel like they are wasting the beauty of nature all around them. We wouldn't want to waste our abilities and privileges would we? Another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family. If you have family near you, then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another. You can have fun with your family by playing board games or cards. You can also have fun by just hanging out, which boosts your social skills and the computer can't always do that, which brings me to my next point. The computer can't do everything, so take advantage of what you have now. Some computer time is fine, but it can be very dangerous by getting addicted to it. The computer @MONTH1 have lots of information, but there is nothing that you can't find in a book. Your computer can't love your dog or hug your child, so there is a reason why we should get off the computer. There are plenty of other things that you can do that you can't do on the computer, including sports, taking care of family, and any of your hobbies. Remember that the computer @MONTH1 be great from time to time, but it can not live your life for you. That is why I believe that we should spend less time on the computer, and more time getting out, and having fun with family, and that the computer can't do everything.
18	18	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I must admit that the experts are certainly right cause I know people that stay on the computer all day and that’s really not good if you ask me. Instead of being on computers learning about faraway places, and talking to other people, you should go exercising, you should relax, and you should interact with family and friends. Exercising is much more better than being on a computer, and I say that to say this. When you're on a computer just sitting there playing online games and checking other things out, or whatever the case @MONTH1 be, you get bored, and hungry, and I know there's some snacks around you while you're doing whatever you're doing. Instead of being on a computer for @NUM1 or @NUM2 hours or maybe even all day getting fat, you could be burning calories. There are many ways you can exercise. You can take walks, you can go jogging, you could play a sport, I mean there are a lot of things you can do when you're not on a computer. I know some people that could be working all day and still come home to their computer. Rest is good also. You don't always have to jump on your computer, you could just relax watch a movie, eat some popcorn and just enjoy yourself, you could even take a nap for a little while or something but you don't always have to get straight on your computer if you really don't have to use it. The way I see it is family, and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important. Friends aren't always dependable so you really don't need them around only a selected few, but that's not the point. Both family, and your true friends have feelings, and if you're not spending time with them over a computer that you're gonna have when you leave, and come back home to, then something isn't right. Tomorrow isn't promised, we live for today. So enjoy life while you got the chance, and spend time doing something active, with family and friends, and if you're really into computers, try to balance your time out.
19	19	1	3	I agree with the advancement of technology. The advancement of technology is helping to find a cure for all kinds of diseases. Technology was what got us to the moon. Technology advances as we make it. The people are in technology for the future and for the good of life. Famous inventors use technology, like Leonardo da Vinci and his advanced flying machine. Technology is the greatest tool for human progress and will continue to shape our world for the better.
20	20	1	3	Well computers can be a good or a bad thing. I don't really see how computers can be a bad thing for me. I also know that computers can or will help people all around the world. I think computers have positive effects on people like me. Computers teaches hand-eye coordination. It can help if you need to find out research for a school project. You can create lots of things on computers like music, designer t-shirts, logos, banners and lots of other creative things. With a computer you can look up available homes and apartments. You can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores; how cool is that!! Well I'm a regular person not rich not famous but computers provide a lot of information people use today. That's why I think that computers have a positive effects on people and you don't have to be super smart to use one; they are accessible tools that open up a world of possibilities for everyone.
21	21	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 daily, I am writing you to address the issue of computers in our society today. Each day new discoverys are made from the people that use computers in our society, however many people say that computers are harmful to are communtiy. Today I am going to convince you and society that computers are not as much as on issue as some people say they are. To begin with discoverys in our nation have been advancing rapidly. Each day new discoverys are benefiting our society however they are only being made possible by the help of computers. Without computers some for dieseases would have never been discovered and more people would have died. For instance, complex medical research relies on computer analysis to identify patterns and potential cures. Secondly, computers have also increased medical care and have been the cave between life or death, as they power diagnostic equipment and enable precise surgical procedures. Finnaly, computers help speed up production rates of cars household neccessitys, and many more objects, making them more affordable and accessible. Have you ever been bored at home and looking for something to do on that dark, rainy, chilly night? Yes, exactly what I thought well the new technology advances in social-networking can even help the most bored and lonelyest people and give them something to do. Even if your just looking to talk to someone you can easily do that on the internet. So you people out there looking for that special someone will always be able to look somewhere. With all the social networks like twitter, myspace, facebook, and youtube you will always have something to do. During this economic recestion it seems that finding a job is so hard, however the internet comes to the rescue yet again. The internet can help you find a job twice if not three times as fast by allowing you to search numerous listings and submit applications instantly. Many people also speed up their word by using the computer for writing and data management. With microsoft things are lot easier to do work that you need to make up, such as creating documents and presentations. I hope that everyone can understand how much the computer help you, rather then hurt you. @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I hope you and the rest of the community can see that computer help you more that they hurt you. Thank you very much for your time and effort that you put in to listen to me.
22	22	1	3	Dear local Newspaper @CAPS1 a take all your computer and given to the people around the world for the can stay in their houses chating with their family and friend. Computers help people around the world to connect with other people, allowing them to share stories and support each other across great distances. Computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world, providing a vast resource for education and current events. This access to information and communication can bring families closer together and foster a greater understanding of global communities. In this way, computers serve as a vital link in our modern world, enhancing both education and personal relationships.
23	23	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you ever see a child on the computer for hours and nothing could get them off? Well I believe that this is very harmful for the child since it doesn't allow them to exersice, interact face to face with people or use their minds to the best of their @NUM1. The more and more we advance in society we get laziar and forget to about these essential things. I think taking a step back from using computers could benefit society more than using them. Obesity in the @LOCATION2 is at its highest @PERCENT1 of kids in the @LOCATION3 agree that they only exersice once a week and would rather spend time on the computer. Think of this, @PERCENT1 of kids. Thats more than @NUM2 of @CAPS2 children. I took the and compared it in @CAPS3 children who don't the benefit of this technology. I learned that @PERCENT1 of children there exersice only once a week. That's for less what these computers are doing to @LOCATION3 @PERCENT2 of children are overweight and @PERCENT3 of them develope heart of blood problems as adults. I by exercise in to go and play with friends or bike, or go for a jog. It doesn't sound hard does it? If we make a to spend this than on computers I think we can reduce this obesity amount and I believe @CAPS2 ran as on overall country. On the computer we have popular websites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. More websites allow you interact with people over the island. This could be in more ways than one. These computer websites are allowing anyone to talk in people who could have the interest in mind. More than @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal posted on them. With this personal info, could and with these websites the crime rate has gone up @PERCENT4. Also, these websites cause people to their social skills. People spend hours on these websites talking to people and forget how to talk face to face. @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 students say they would say something online that they wouldn't say to someone's face. This creates more problems in schools and could possibly make someone hurt someone else or themselves. I've heard all over the news about suicides and because of computers and I believe with less of them people would spend more time with their family and or nation would be closer and safer. Computers dont allow you to explore nature and use your mind to the best of its ability. Computers make it easy and I myself, think it makes me laziar because it allow me to read a book there or read about other people, instead of going to a library and getting a book. Computers take away time to actually use your mind and problem solve in real life solution. There's years and I've learned I can be on the computer for hours playing them and not realize it at all. Without them, would make a difference. Kids are living through computers and we can change them by encouraging more active and interpersonal engagements in the real world.
24	24	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I've heard that not many people think computers benefit society. I disagree with that. Computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foregin places, and allow people to communicate with others online. Some people were basically born with hand-eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand-eye coordination has gone up! ""On average, computers can increase a persons hand-eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1 says @PERSON2. Think of it, just by learning to tye, your hand-eye coordination can go up @PERCENT1.! That's amazing! Having good hand-eye coordination will get you far in life, and helps with small, everyday things such as playing an instrument, or doing household chores. It also helps in sports. You need good hand-eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim. If more people spend more time on the computer, then the population's hand-eye coordination would increase, and who wouldn't want thats. Have you ever heard of @LOCATION1? It is a country in @LOCATION2 that no one really knows much about. By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge, and will make us more of people around the world. This can improve our travel. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. We @MONTH1 also learn about their traditions, and culture. ""The internet gives us access to the world,"" says @PERSON1, ""we can learn so many new things that will make us more of people, countries, and the environment."" @CAPS1 is right, we can also be aware of the environment. Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how o preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips! In a recent study @PERCENT2 of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 can keep your social life in tact, and can even reunite yu with old friends. For example, @CAPS2 suggest family. You can keep in touch wih many people trough @CAPS2! Also, you can make new friends. Most teens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Sites like @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. I once talked with someone on @CAPS7 for over an hour! We found that we both have @CAPS4 accounts and keep in touch there! This also helps you gain confidence because you @MONTH1 have the courage to say something over the computer that you would't say real life. The computer can really amp up your social life. As you can see. computers don't just ""your barain,"" they imprdove hand-eye coordination, help you learn about far away places, and improve your social life by allowing you to talk to others. Computers benefit the society more than anymore will ever know and are a positive force in our modern world."
25	25	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 off, I beileve that computers are very helpfull to many people by looking up information, or talking to friends. Although many kids should be spending their time outside, the computer is a well-occupied environment that helps kids learn and interact with others. I believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire. Although, they should always make time go outside, hang out with friends, ect. The computer @MONTH1 be fun but its always important to get outside and enjoy nature. Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health. If a child gets addicted to the computer it will affect how he interacts with other and @MONTH1 do serious damage to their brain, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. Although, I believe children should have the right on the computer, it's always important to spend time outside enjoying nature and engaging in physical activity. Another reason why I think children should have the right to the computer is because of the information they learn and discover. Many kids grow up to have a career in computer makings or program designing. Some kids @MONTH1 have their education online or use the computer to teach others, accessing a world of knowledge. The computer is a non-stop generation of intelligence based to help people learn, play and discover. Many people have dream to one day build a computer or make new programs, and early exposure can foster these ambitions. All students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends. Everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing. I do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how other think of them, so a balanced approach is the most beneficial path forward.
26	26	1	3	"Do you think that computers are useless? Or do you think they could be useful in many ways? I remember when my older sister had to do some research on her history project, the computer gave her all of the information she needed quickly and efficiently. The issue to grapple with is, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly think that using a computer does benefit society in many ways! Heres why, the computer allows you to get in touch with friends, research people, places or things, and relax and enjoy playing on a fun, entertaining website! My first reason is that a computer allows you to talk to family or friends so you all get back in touch if a friend of yours moved to a diffrent state, then you can easily get back in touch straight from the computer. ""It's nice to send emails or pictures to friends, but if you do it from the computer then it gets done so much faster!"" said one of my neighbors, Mrs. Johnson. My next reason is that you can research anything you want like people, places or things and all refferances will come up. It is good to research for any projects, or school assignments you might have. I remember when my brother was working on his science project. Everything he had trouble with, he found directly on the computer, from diagrams to detailed explanations! My final reason is that there are alot of fun and exciting websites that you can relax and play on! These websites can keep you busy, and you wont be bored while playing! ""When I'm bored I go on the computer and play games, that I find on Miniclip.com,"" explained my younger cousin, Sarah. Computers might make people become adicted to them. Yes but, you will be learning some interesting things on how the internet works while you use them. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly beleive that they do benefit society, heres why you can get in touch with people, you can research, and play fun games! It's now or never to decide what you think! Call me and we will talk this through and share our perspectives on this important topic."
27	27	1	3	Computers are good because you can get information, you can play games, you can get pictures, But when you are on the computer you might find something or someone that is bad or is a virus. If there is a virus you might want to shut off the computer so it does not get worse and damage your files. There are websites for kids, like games, there are teen games, there are adult games, providing different types of entertainment for various ages. Also pictures are bad for kids because most of the time they lead to inapropreit pictures that are not suitable for young viewers. You should only look up information that you need not things like wepons or knifes which could be dangerous or harmful. Also there are differnt kinds of companies that make computers, like Dell and Apple. Apple is a good place to get computers and so is Dell, as they both offer reliable machines for different needs and preferences.
28	28	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers are high tec and have expanded into an everyday thing. They play a big role in society. Computers have been improved to do many different things without them we would barely get any thing done efficiently. Although kids should start going outside more, computers teaches kids new things, and it is useful. With computers kids are rarely going outside. A lot of our population of the United States are obese, including kids. Because of this they are staying inside and on their computer for many hours each day. Kids need to go outside every once and a while to get some fresh air and exercise for their health. If they limit their time on the computer and do some active game outside it would be better for the child. Since computers are rapidly growing and adapting kids spend half of the day on it just staring at the screen playing some flash game, like run escape. Instead of wasting their time doing that they should go outside, take a walk just do something active! Computers teaches kids new things. Google something like trees. You would get a bunch of websites containing information about trees, their types, and where they grow. Kids also play games, if they don't know it, some of the games they play are teaching them stuff, for an example, my little sister, goes on a site called nickelodeon.com I see that right and it teaches her stuff she didn't know before, like shapes and colors. from those types of games it prepared her for kindergarden by introducing basic concepts. Now a days more and more sites keep adapting and becoming known like bing, offering new ways to find information. Computers are real useful. suppose you want to know whats going on at work. So click your mouse on internet explorer and get your email to check for updates. With computers, you could go on social networking sites, like facebook and connect with friends to see what they are doing. You can also go on instant messaging site to talk to friends and see what there up to in real time. For your entertainment you could play games to unwind after a long day. Remember though to not stay on too long and take breaks. Computers are a big deal in our community. Life would be very difficult without them to help with daily tasks. But remember not to stay on too long and to balance your time! Although kids should start going outside, computers, teaches kids new things, and is useful for both learning and staying connected.
29	29	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Many people throughout the world use, or own computers. Although there are many people who think computers are good for you, others could say different, pointing out potential downsides. While you are on the computer you can become more social by talking with friends or family who live far away. Also, while you are on the computer you might not notice it but; your hand-eye coordination is improving as you type and navigate, and finally, you are able to search with a click of a button, instead of searching your topic through dozens of books at a library. Computers have very many benefits. One being chatting, or talking online to friends, and family. You might have a distant friend that you haven't talked to in a while. With a computer you are able to re connect with your buddy through email or a message. If you have an account that is safe to chat on, you might be able to make new friends from different places. That would be good for you, socially, expanding your circle. It is always good to have friends, and stay in touch with family to maintain strong relationships. Some people find it hard to play a piano because they cannot look at the music and have their hands be doing something else. On a computer your hand-eye-coordination improves over time because, you are searching a topic as your hands are typing on the keyboard. Also, this is a great memory exercise for your fingers as you learn. You eventually memorize where all of the keys are located without looking. People without computers have to search through many books to find information on their topic, which takes a long time. Others with computers, just have to type in their topic and all the information they need is right in front of them on the screen. You are able to see pictures of your topic or even video's that provide more context! Not many books that I know, can search a topic, show you pictures, and videos of it with one resource so conveniently! Many people debate the fact if computers are good for you or not, weighing the pros and cons. If you ask me, computers are great for people. It allows people to be social, and talk to old friends; it also improves your hand-eye coordination, and finally; it gives you the option to search a topic without all the hassle of searching through dozens of books in a library. So now the question is up to you; are computers good for people, or not? The answer depends on how they are used.
30	30	1	3	Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few important reasons. Computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them for entertainment. Computers make work easier and neater for everyone involved. Typing is often faster than writing by hand, and is always easier to read for the recipient. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to thirty percent more free time to do whatever they want, like hobbies. Computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper, which is good for the environment. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing manually. If you need to solve a complex math problem you use a calculator or a computer program. So you don't have to figure it out yourself with pen and paper. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator to check my answers. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them during their free time. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational and teach valuable skills. Even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done for the day. A majority of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work in school and at home. I hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society by making tasks simpler and providing enjoyment.
31	31	1	3	"I agree that computers definitely are an advantage to our society. I think this because they help us communicate and video chat with family and friends online, and they are used as a great tool with school work, or work purposes. Most of all for the enjoyment of children, the fun computer games now help them prepare for real life consequences, like how the game Webkinz teaches kids to care for pets. ""Do you have a social media account?"" my cousin asked me. ""Yes, please friend request me,"" I replied. Later that night, I get home and check my account, a new notification pops up and I am now friends with my cousin online. My entire family is on this platform and I think it's so useful for several reasons, like making plans and organizing parties. I hate writing invitations by hand, but now every year for my birthday party I just type them up, taking less than five minutes. Or, for an even simpler way of sending invitations you can even just type an email or a direct message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over the internet. It's so easy, you just create an event and tag all of your friends in the note. Also, it's so easy to get responses because you automatically get notified. Technology like this drastically makes life easier. For example, have you ever gotten something new and just can't wait to show your friends? Well, now you can, in the comfort of your own home. All you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too. ""Wow, Sarah! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!"" I said. ""Thank you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty,"" says Sarah. I love webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were in the same exact room as you. As you can see, webcamming is so much easier than spending more time and money, and my mom's time and getting a ride over to her house. Computers make life so much more convenient. Another example how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand writing and most kids won't like writing it anyways. Like myself, I type faster than I write and that's why I agree one hundred percent that computers benefit society. Most importantly, computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you. How impressive would that be? If I was applying for a professional position of a job, I know I'll type my resume to make it look neat and professional. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, beneficial, important and fun to our society."
32	32	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, My name is Emily and I am a concerned citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society at all! In my opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are harms computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are in chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that a large percentage of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows what teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, in chatrooms who knows what kind of people are in there. Children need to be careful about what they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful scenery around them. We're all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice what a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice summer or spring day, people should take their kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last spring when I went to my cousin's house. My aunt only allowed us to watch one hour of TV a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and helped us enjoy the environment. My last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know what you're thinking, when you're on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging, call them. Maybe even invite them out to talk face to face. That reminds me of my sister. When I get home, she will normally be on her phone. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""What's up?"" or ""How was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take real communication away. As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly affecting our community. Not only our community but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash if we don't fix this issue. So what are you going to do about it?"
33	33	1	3	Dear, School Board I think the effects that computers do on people are really positive. Computers can be used for all sorts of things. Examples like finding things out about history, people that changed the world, and other information. Computers give the power for children to learn in new and engaging ways. For example, there are lots of websites that offer online tutoring or good ways to help you pass school. Another positive way is online dating sites. You can meet new people and it is a good way to make life even better. Popular sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and so on make a good way to keep in touch with friends from your past, or even make new ones. But the most that I think that's the best in my opinion is going to school online. Once you're done with college and you are a nurse, for an example you can get a higher degree like a registered nurse then being a licensed practical nurse. I think computers have a positive effect on people because they open up many opportunities for learning and connection.
34	34	1	3	Dear Principal, There is a rumor going around saying that computers are a negative affect in a childs life. I disagree. A computer can help a kid in so many ways, it can help students with homework, let students talk to friends, and help with school projects. And besides, most kids don't stay on the computer very long anyways. Homework, it's a big role in school, if you don't do it or worse don't get it, it can bring you down. That's why computers have websites that help a child learn how to do a problem or a social studies question if they don't know. If you go to the school web page then there's a link that brings you to math games. There's even a link to a science website. This helps a child so they don't get stressed out over homework. A computer also helps a student interact with friends. A social life is very important to a middle schooler. This is where a computer can have AIM, Facebook, and even Myspace help a kid connect with friends. If a kid got into a fight at school they can come home and talk online to work it out and not leave it unsettled. A computer also helps make new friends from other towns. Teens need to socialize and make new friends which helps them later in life. If a teen needs help with a project then they can ask a friend for help online. Every student gets a take home project at some point and instead of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils, you can stay home, save money and type the essay. Computers can help with a social studies or a science project. You can print pictures and find information. Drawing by hand can be a hassle and messy, so using a computer saves time and the mess. If there are words you don't understand then you can look them up online. Computers are the easiest and best way to do a project. Computers, everyone uses them, they help our parents just as much as us. They help us with homework, let us talk to friends, and even help us do our projects! Computers are one of the best technologies we have today.
35	35	1	3	Dear Editor, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Where would we be without them? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. Obviously, computers are beneficial. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, as I said earlier. I know people say that when you are on the computer, you spend less time exercising, but the computers help you with your throwing skills in games. Hand eye coordination also applies for if you want to be a surgeon or a doctor. You need to have steady hands and be ready to do whatever is needed. See, they do have a positive effect. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They give people the ability to learn about anything they want on the internet. Say you want to be an engineer when you grow up, you might want to learn anything and everything you can to be successful later on in that career. What about a doctor, you would want to know how many years of college and med school are required to get your medical degree. A computer helps you learn about those things. It can also teach you about tons of other subjects. Again, how could they not be positive. I think computers have a positive effect on people. Another thing they can do out of a hundred others is let you communicate with other people no matter how far away. Mail can go anywhere with enough postage, yes, but email is free and gets there in less than a minute where mail can take weeks to go far. For example, what if you came from another country. You wouldn't want to lose touch with people you grew-up with. With a computer, you could use Skype to see and hear the person. Talking on the phone or mailing letters doesn't even compare to that. You could never lose touch! Computers help people do all kinds of things. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. There are no bad reasons that could top any of these. They make sense. So, what do you think? Do you think they are good for us, or do we need less computers?
36	36	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? It is a very negative effect. Computers are one of the main reasons of why kids do not exercise and become obese, it can effect students' grades, and by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones. First of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you @MONTH1 ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. Researches from well-known colleges, such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2, discovered that @PERCENT1 of kids who spend more than two hours on the @CAPS6 are obese or will become heavier when they are older. After speaking with @PERSON1, graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather and engaging in physical activities. As a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising and burning off calories! My second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades! After I spoke with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she told me that the reason why her grades drop is because she is too busy on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She does not focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. This shows that even ""A"" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Additionally, from being on the @CAPS6 so much and not paying attention at @ORGANIZATION1 work, it can effect your best grades on the @ORGANIZATION3's! This shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skills and your future prospects. My last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being on outgoing, talkative individual! Everytime you log into that death trap device, your selfesteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. You just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronics device that is going to take you no where in life. Also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @CAPS6 @NUM3. You will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranky and rude to your family just becuase you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. Do you really want to act that way to your family? So, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?"
37	37	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us. Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benifit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay intach with friends or family that live faraway, and stay orginized. Sometimes people are on the computer, learning and they don't even know @CAPS1. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, you automaticly see the news feeds of things happening around the world. Other times people go online diliberatly to learn. If someone is thinking about going to @LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about @CAPS1. Simply by searching equadore many choices will pop up you climate, sesonal weather, hotel options, and other farts. But thats not the only way people are learning on the internet. Now, many college students have the option of taking their lessons online. This is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay intouch with your friends if they moved away? I remember in second grade my bestfriend, @LOCATION2, move away. I was so sad. I badey ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a vidio chat! I felt like I was right their with her! This was great, and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. Another great way to stay intouch into friends and family is through e-mail. By writing a message and sending @CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easey, and your personal wants can chat and emails are a easey thing to send world wide. So many people love to type on a keyboard as well, but so many different papers that you type could be lost. I, for me, hate clutter, and I have so many school binders for papers to be lost in. This is why I take great advantage of typing my paper every chance I get. My computer keeps me orginiced because I could never loose my work. File save, is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. Then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy. I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason. Also, I myself am a much faster typer than I am writer so my work is a lot needey on the computer. As you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is goof for our society you can learn, stay intouch with friends and family, and stay orginiced. Many people, could agree with me. Don't you?
38	38	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go, whether it is a new restaurant or a friends house. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one and see for yourself."
39	39	1	3	Dear local Newspaper A lot more people uses computers daily but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. Those people who supports advsnces in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on the people and I agree on some circumstances but looking at the situation cleary I dont agree due to the fact that its better not spending to much time on the computers. First because its way better excercising, @CAPS1 enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family. @CAPS2 why I dont agree that people should be in ther computer more their doing things better in life. First, becacuse it's useful to exercise. Talking a walk around the nieghborhood of just going for a hike with people you know. Even better going to the gym its such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting infront of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit, healthy and strong for as long as you live. A computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is whats going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing. I know nobody would want that for sure. @CAPS1, enjoy nature live life the way it needs to. Gods creations of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world dont let it go all to waist. Jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face. Make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about. Third and last, interact with your family and friends. Spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels. Go with them for some ice cream. Dont let them feel left out or unloved. The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parks like six flag or lake compound of place like nomads or chuckie cheese its a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as well. This is why I think sitting infront of a computer screen all day, first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or @CAPS1 enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends, @CAPS2 why sitting infront of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life. Technology holds you back from the real things in life. Thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration. Good day!
40	40	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 I am @NUM1 and I go to naylor school. I am writing to you convince that computers have a positive effect on people. Please read the following reasons. Computers have a positive effect on people. Your able to communicate with people all over the world. When my brother goes on the computer he get's to talk to my family in @LOCATION1 I like to use skpye because when we talk to family in @CAPS1.R we use a webcam to keep in touch with my family. They teach hand eye coordination and help me in ping-pong. It help me wacth the ball in computer and I do the same in the wreak. You have lot's of access to different information, my mom found a job in the computer. Everybody have access to weather or news, which is very helpful for planning your day. Some say it's a lack of exercise. People get addicted to the computer. Some can get obese and mess with your love life. But these problems can be managed with a little bit of self-control and balance. These are the reasons why I belive computers are good for society. This is why people should agree that advance in technology is a positive step forward. Technology keeps on upgrading and improving our lives in many ways.
41	41	1	3	I think computers are good because you can talk to your friends and family on the computers, which helps you stay connected with loved ones who live far away. People needs computers to look for a job, as many companies now only post job openings and accept applications online. Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework, and people need to stop and manage their time better to ensure their responsibilities are met.
42	42	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Computers have a negitive affect on people and their to connect with others because they always are on the computer and never outside. My first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them. People I know have complained of their eyes hurting after using the computer, experiencing strain and dryness. Studys show taht @PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likly to loose their eye sight than people who are outside all day. Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likly to have good people skills. If you don't have good people skills then you probibly wont have alot of friends and if you need them it would probibly be over the computer, which limits real-world interactions. And you never know what they could be like. Also if your inside all day then you will not get the proper excersize could be very bad you and others, leading to poor health. My third and final reason is that people will makes fun of you if you sit inside all day don't come out because your on the computer. If you ar on the computer you are more likly to fail in school you don't do your homework or projects but instead your on the computer playing games. And your more likly to get into fights with your parents or guardians because your on the computer and they never see you or hear from you. Also they wont be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone, causing financial problems. So these are just some of the reasons I think computers could be bad. Thank you for considering my points on this important matter.
43	43	1	3	The effect of people using computers isn't anything bad couse you learn a lot from it. In some ways when you use the computer and you type, the typing exercises your fingers. Your fingers will get muscle and will teach you to remember where to type without looking down on the keyboard, improving your speed. People sometimes using computer is good because if your writing letters you don't have to use pencil you can just type it and print, which is much faster. The typing does all the work for you so you won't spend hours writing to someone. Computers are helpful to people for example, ir your researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1 you can find almost all the information on the computer in a instant click, making learning efficient. Computers save time and does a lot of work, helping with many daily tasks. Computers are helpful piece of technology and one of the best inventions we have for information and communication.
44	44	1	3	People are spending too much time on computers. People that spend to much time on the computer do not have time to interact with family or friends, missing out on important conversations. People spened to much time on the computer. The kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. They also get tired every easy. First of all people spend to much time on the computer. @PERCENT1 of kids spend @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer, which is a significant portion of their day. I once spent @NUM3 hours on my computer on @CAPS1. A lot of kids go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and iTunes. My friend spent @NUM4 hours on those websites. People spend way to long on the computer. Another reason, kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. @PERCENT2 of kids that spend a lot of time on the computer forget to study for test. Once I spent all night on the computer and the next day I failed a test. Kids forget to do homework to. My friend was having so much fun on the computer he forget to do his homework. Kids should get off the computer and worry about school. My final reason, kids get tired from being on the computer for so long. @PERCENT3 of kids get so tired they can't do anything once they get off the computer. I got so tired from being on the computer for so long I took a nap. @PERCENT4 of kids forget they made plans after school. One kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends. Kids need to get away from the computer. In conclusion, kids spend to much time on computers. People spend to much time on computer. Kid end up getting bad grade because they spend time on the computer. Aslo, kids get tired very quickly from being on the computer. Something has to be done about this issue to help children lead more balanced lives.
45	45	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you think the computers don't help you with research? Well, if you really think about it computers @CAPS1 help you. You can't always gain wait by just looking or staying on a computer. And you can defenetly still talk with kids, friends, and family members on computer through video calls and messages. @CAPS1 you no if books have all the information you need for school project, or your own family history. Maybe books have our history of wars and of our heros. Try and see if you can find the first ancestor of your family. The computer are the reasons why we no our history and know about actors, slaves, sergents, and much more, providing vast databases of knowledge. Have you gain weight just from staying on the computer for too long. I haven't gain a pound or an ounce since I've been on computer. Not only can you gain weight or lose weight just by being on the computer. How @CAPS1 you know if the person on the computer is not looking for diet foods or fat free things? Or if the person is eating while being on the computer. @CAPS1 you get large phone bills just for a two minute long distance call? Why @CAPS1 you think we have enternet websites such as myspace, facebook, twitter, msn and lots more for free communication. Most of my family members life in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and @LOCATION2 and just for a call its like ten dollars for a minute. While you can be on the internet for about day to night and still pay the same price for your monthly service. So what @CAPS1 you choose pay over thirty dollars just for a long distance call or stay on the computer. Or get bad grades for doing the bad research. Its you chooce, choose now if either talk with family and friends on phone and pay over your bill money or stay on web chat for how long you want and still get the same bill price, making the computer a smarter financial and educational choice.
46	46	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to inform you that the time we spend on computers is needed because it helps you with information, it helps you to become smarter, and it helps you with hand-eye coordination. I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reasons. My first reason I'll like to state that will convince you the time we spend on computers is needed is it helps us with information and it teaches stuff about places, people, culture and more. It teaches us useful information which takes a while to learn, so the time we spend on computers is needed to learn new information and understand complex topics. My second reason I'll like to state that will convince you the time we spend on computers is needed is it helps us to become smarter. Say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site and it helps you with it, providing step-by-step solutions. Computers make you become smarter by offering access to countless educational resources. And at the end of the day it's about who's smarter not who does more exercise. My third and final reason which contributes to why we spend the time we spend on computers is needed because it teaches you good hand-eye coordination. This is because it helps with typing and becoming faster at doing essays, and when you have good hand-eye coordination you don't make a lot of mistakes typing, allowing for more efficient work. So I have come to my conclusion why a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information, you become smarter, and it teaches good hand-eye coordination. This is why a lot of computer time is needed, probably even more computer time is needed. A lot of computer time is needed because you get smarter plus it benefits society by creating a more informed and skilled population.
47	47	1	3	Dear newspaper, I feel as though internet or computers act as an advantage in society rather than a problem. They help with school work, like projects or email, making research and communication seamless. You can even take college online now, accessing lectures and materials from anywhere. People also use the internet for media or to simply catch up with friends, sharing photos and messages instantly. One of the most important reasons to have a computer is for school oriented reasons, like having a project that you need to get notes for or making a powerpoint presentation with images and charts. One other great reason is for the teachers, whose computers can help them teach a class in a way that is both fun and easy to understand through interactive software. The new uprising in computer use has brought about new ways of getting a college degree, offering flexibility for many students. Now you can even just simply get in bed, turn on your laptop, and take college classes right on your computer, saving time and travel costs. I don't know about you guys but I'd much rather take college in the own comfort of my home than drive to a campus all the time. Another great use for the internet is email, which makes our lives a lot easier now that more people use it for quick messages. It can send us school alerts like an early dismissal or a way to catch up with old high school friends, keeping everyone connected. Another great reason for the internet is for entertainment or just to have fun and relax after a long day. A large percentage of people that have computers use them for media or fun reasons, like gaming, or to go on to youtube to watch videos. Please add this article into your newspaper so that the computer can be put out there as a helping aid, and not something that is going to make the whole world obese because that's not just from computers. It's the people who use computers who felt that they don't get exercise, not the computers themselves. So why put them out in a bad way when they offer so many clear benefits for education and communication.
48	48	1	3	"Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at a certain time and all of a sudden it's seven at night, with the hours slipping away unnoticed. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen, missing the sunshine. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there without moving your body at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are overweight, which shows the impact on health. Being on the computer on a beautiful day is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of spring, ignoring the world's natural beauty. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer to experience life more fully. When you're on the computer, time really flies by and you lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun and active? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room, isolated from those who care about you. You should be with your family and friends, creating memories that last a lifetime. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along, but your relationships are irreplaceable. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow, so time is precious. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them, talking and sharing stories? You're changing too, so you might be off to college or have to move far away for business, making these moments even more valuable. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye,"" my grandma said to my mom, highlighting how quickly time passes. Almost a majority of parents feel that same way, wishing for more family time. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and cherish each moment you have together. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places that are more engaging. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine, filled with detailed knowledge. Using books to look up information is better than typing the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf, building research skills. A trip to the library may not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place for a real adventure? If you're doing a report on a distant location for school it would be a lot of fun to go there for a few days to learn about it firsthand, immersing yourself in the culture. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online, creating personal souvenirs. It would be a really fun family trip, bringing everyone closer together. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as a nearby town, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family and exploring new sights together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun and building lasting relationships?"
49	49	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology, making it a powerful tool. Computers effects many people for what it does, influencing daily life and work. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly, adapting to new programs with ease. Many people love computers for the opportunities they provide. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world, connecting different cultures. They teach positive things for people to learn, such as new languages or historical facts. Computers even have a positive effect on people across the world, bridging distances. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned, reinforcing knowledge. Such as, hand-eye coordination, which improves with practice. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes and coordinate your fingers. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world, from news articles to social media. Celebrities are very popular on computers or other technologies, with fans following their updates. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies, offering interactive lessons. Anything you can get on any other technologies, like videos or music, is available. There is a guarantee you will find it on your computer, making it a central hub. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others, like for complex tasks. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other as efficiently. If we did not have phones to use to call someone, computers offer an alternative. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address, sending messages instantly. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years, rekindling old friendships. You can look up images or videos that you haven't seen in years, rediscovering memories. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of, staying current with events. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world, our lives would be very different and more difficult. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good as computers would be popular without them, but they wouldn't offer the same capabilities. I wonder what it will be like? It is a question that makes us appreciate the role computers play in modern society.
50	50	1	3	Computers are the greatest tool mankind has ever created, revolutionizing how we live and work. They give people access to more information than anything else in the world, from ancient history to current events. They let us connect faraway places with one click of the button, making the world feel smaller and more accessible. Without computers people would never know and learn or do as much as they can today, as many discoveries rely on them. Without computers modern planes or cars would not exist, as their design and operation depend on complex computations. Without a computer this very text probably would not exist, showing how integral they are to creation and communication. So no conclusion can be made that we spend too much time on the computer, because theres more to do and learn than one can do in a single lifetime, making every moment spent on them a valuable opportunity for growth and connection.
51	51	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered how to get somewhere and you didn't have a map or a GPS near you and the only thing that was near you was a computer. Well I am saying you should go on it and search where you want to go. Computers are very helpful in everyone's daily life they have so many facts and interesting things on them, think about again trying to figure out where someone lives it's very easy, go on google and type in someone's address and there you go. The computer is also very good because have you ever thought about one of your friends or a special someone and you haven't seen them in like a really long time and you miss them well no problem mostly all computers have some sort of camera in them where you could video chat or just chat regular on the internet. That is very helpful because even though you could just go on the phone and call them it's better to do it online because how about if you haven't seen them you want to see a picture of them they could just send it to you on some sort of chat page or just your email. It is so much better than mailing one picture in the mail and it takes days for the mail to come if you could do it the faster way on line and on video chat it will be better. The computer is also very helpful because how about one day you want to go somewhere and you don't know what the weather is going to be well you could go to put on the tv and see but there is so many commercials and you can't really see because they move the weather days fast. On the computer you could type the weather in for one week and it will tell you and you could look at it for as long as you want and it will stay there so you could see the whole week without the screen having fast as the image is not in the light light or if it's to dark. The computer is so helpful. People do say that it is good to get off the computer and go for a walk outside in nature I do agree with that but people and children do get their exercising by walking around the house and going outside going shopping. Computers are helpful and nice and another thing is say one day you are online and you are looking at clothes or shoes and you want to buy them but you don't want to go to the mall a half hour away from where you live you could just buy them online and they will be shipped to your house and you don't even have to lift a finger. They are also good because they have like a dictionary on it where if you don't know how to spell a word you type it in the best way you can and it corrects your spelling and tells you what the word is, also the computers have pictures of everything, if you want to see how something looks like you can type it in and shows you. With all the facts I have given you I hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful nice and safe for everyone to use.
52	52	1	3	Dear leaders of society I am writing this letter to you to explain the many benefits towards computers. My first reason will explain the many ways computers help you and I believe that people using computers is a very good idea. They believe this because computers make you really focus and pay attention to the screen and the tasks you are performing. This gives you really great eye sight and amazing hand eye coordination from using the keyboard and mouse. An important ability that computers have is they are able to teach you about far away places depending on where you live. The reason people would probably want to visit one of these places on a website would probably be for vacation purposes to plan a trip. My third reason to why I feel we should keep computers is that there is a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as they're online. IAM, Skype, Facebook etc. These are all great uses for computers to stay connected. Also people who own a well paying job use an email system on these computers that tells them who wants to sell a piece of machinery, or anything that involves business ethics and professional communication. Now you know my three very important reasons to why computers are a great way to get hand eye coordination, a great way to learn about other states and countries, and so you can talk to friends and have an email for business purposes. I hope you have enjoyed reading this and hope to see you on my side toward this topic of supporting computer use.
53	53	1	3	"Dear School Board, To begin, I understand that people don't like computers because they are over used. If the computers are so bad then they shouldn't be used, but how I see it is that they also bring more good than bad. These points to computer welfare are they bring sources, their is interaction between people, and computers are going to advance more over time. Even though these people think they are overused they still use them for their own needs. So, even I use the computer a lot, but it could be used for good purposes like education and research. First and foremost, these computers can get sources online that can't be found in books or the local library. Their are search engines that you can find your topics on quickly and easily. Then, when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over in other materials. They can show the other side of the story that they didn't say in the book, providing a more complete view. Your projects that you used to have to go to the library for you now can do from home, that itself is a step that you aren't considering for convenience and efficiency. For instance if people are on a lot sixty percent of the time it is for research and learning. Furthermore, people can interact with friends over the computer from different locations. They can talk, send pictures, or play games together online. For example, I play xbox and I talk to my friends over that a lot of the time. Even a video game is fun as being with them, quoted from Bill Gates ""I have a computer not for friends, but for work"". This shows that even large important figures still use it for work and business. People say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike, a valuable skill. My mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job. So, I am here with my parents because of a computer bringing them together. None the less, the computers are at their beginning and they will further improve with new technology. So people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer for work or social connection. This advancement is going to advance again and again so there won't be a way to stop it thus, people will be on it only more and more so there is no chance of stopping the outbreak of computers in our daily lives. Then you will try to stop them with sayings like ""computers eat your brain"". We all know that is garbage and not based on fact. To conclude, I implore you not to try and change the habits of others who find value in computer use. I insist that if people want to use computer they can for their own benefit and needs. I say this with the sources, the friends and the advancement in mind for a better future."
54	54	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Hello! I am an eighth grade student at Jefferson Middle School. I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benefit society. I completely disagree with these comments. let me explain my point of view... Having computers definitely benefits for all students in their academic work. Sometimes kids forget their text books at school and cannot complete assignments. But if they have a computer, they can just google the information needed for their homework. That way they get their homework done, and don't have to take a zero for a missing assignment. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called, study island. If you haven't, it's a website for all the students in the district to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade which is very important. So, if we get an A on study island we get an A in one of our classes for that assignment. Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way with my hobbies. I love the piano and want to learn how to play. But, there are no instructions in my area for lessons. However, there is a program on the computer called synthesia which is very helpful. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano by showing you which keys to press. The piano helps my hand-eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication to practice regularly. Now, synthesia isn't the only free instrument learning program available online. There are many others for different instruments! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you achieve things later in life like joining a band. Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completely true for everyone. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms to improve their health. How do I know this? Well one day when I went on google the top search of the day was, ""weight watchers diet plan"" which is very popular. Also, my mom uses an online video workout website, for her bad back and it helps her feel better. So not only does the computer help for diets, they can help physical therapy also for recovery. So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benefit our society in many ways, yes, we should not spend too much time on it and balance our activities. But, online learning sessions can be time consuming for good reasons. It helps many people figure out the right diet and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy in their lives."
55	55	1	3	ARE YOU KIDDING!! Computers are great, they're great because of these three main reasons. Kids can do homework on computers, also you could video chat with friends and family finally because you could look up just about anything you want on the computer for information. Computers are great because kids can do their homework on the computer, that's good because if they forgot their book in school or something like that then they could just get the answers off the computer for their assignments. It's also good for business men because they count on computers for all their files and important documents to do their jobs. Computer are also great because you can video chat with friends and family who are far away. Video chatting is awesome because if a friend or relative goes out of town they could just bring their laptop or webcam and then you can talk to them whenever you want to see them. Video chatting is also good for company's if their buyer is in a different country they could just video chat all the information needed for a deal. Finally, computers are great because they are so resourceful for finding information. There are hundreds of websites where all you have to do is type in what you want to know and there will be thousands of links for you to search and get your answer to any question. They are also resourceful for pictures or maybe even powerpoint presentation for school or work projects! In conclusion, computers are great because, kids can get their homework done, also it's good for video chat with loved ones finally because the internet is very resourceful for learning and business.
56	56	1	3	Over the past decade, the percentage of people using computers has increased by approximately @PERCENT1. All of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide. The variety of data bases and resources, the increased communication, and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation. Communication over computers benefits society as people can now interact with one another from anywhere. Personally I have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers. Different communication programs include @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and e-mail, the most commonly used site. Without having access to a computer and its contents, residents have a difficult time integrating themselves within the rest of society, whether for school events, sport schedules, or keeping in touch with far away family and friends. Computers allow all of these essentials to be part of society, and the way this generation has decided to start our lives. Parents and teenagers these days have become very lazy in comparison to the way they used to behave. They are not interested in going to the library in order to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have been a huge convenience in a person's life by allowing all the information that was once in books to be contained throughout the internet. For example, if you are doing a project for school, the internet will provide you with any information you need. It is truly astonishing how much one electronic instrument can impact and influence a life. Being a student, I am commonly curious about what references teachers are making and additional information that is not provided. The internet allows any person in possession of a computer to research what they have wondered about and to get a response on the subject almost immediately. The benefits of computers can practically cover the few negative effects, as it is a way to let a person discover various information on any desired subject. Besides searching for information, computers can be used to document data of your own. Microsoft has invented several applications which allow you to graph information, design presentations, and neatly record drafts of writing. No person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes. Microsoft helps take your exentuated imperfections and hide them by doing things as little as making a neater copy of your essay, or putting your lists of data into graph form to make it more eye-friendly to viewers. Society has become reliant on sources scattered throughout the databases on computers, and by directly looking at the negative effects that a computer can have on a person and therefore putting restrictions on this information source will enable society to have the positive donations that computers these days have on our way of life, ensuring we can harness their power responsibly.
57	57	1	3	Technology in @DATE1 has become far more advanced. Computers are one of the most futuristic objects. The computer is good for connecting to people around the world. However, computers have bad effects on people's lives. Children are taking time out of their homework to go on the computer, citizens are gaining weight, and children are being kidnapped. School is very important and valuable if you want to succeed in life. However, computers have made it difficult for students to concentrate on their homework. This is a horrible habit and a bad effect on students everywhere. Students' grades will suffer and they will not obtain class credits if this problem is not mentioned. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1, where five out of every ten @CAPS1 are either overweight or obese. This can lead to serious health issues and even death. The problem is that people are spending hours on the computer each day. Most of that time could be used to exercise. Exercising can be an important benefit to someone's life. If this problem is not addressed millions of Americans will be overweight. @CAPS2 is a very serious and dangerous topic. Every month dozens of kids are kidnapped. Since the internet was invented there is a twenty percent increase rate of kids missing. Children will go on popular networking websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and Twitter and give out their important information. Pedophiles use the internet to trick children into giving their address. This problem needs to stop and be addressed by the police. Everyday, more and more people use computers. Computers have good and bad effects on people's lives. The bad effects are very serious and dangerous. How would you feel if your child fails school, gains weight, or gets kidnapped because of the computer? These significant risks must be carefully considered by all members of society.
58	58	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I'm writing to you about the debate that you are having asking if people should use computers. The article stated ""more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society."" I think people should not use computers. Also technology needs to slow down; it's getting too advanced. My first reason why people need to stop spending time on computers is, you don't want to always say to your spouse on your honeymoon ""we could see @LOCATION1 from our computer."" And your life will go by fast and you won't notice it, until you're all fat and old. Also @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are over weight because they don't exercise. Secondly the more technology there is, we are going to have less real-world experiences. In addition it feels better when you work hard and not just sit on your computer, getting a monthly check. In conclusion you live a happier life when you explore the world directly. In @PERCENT2 of people who use computers commit suicide, which is a tragic statistic. Also if it was up to me I would limit the use of computers. Read all the facts about computers and you will think differently, just like me. I used to be a computer geek, but I have since realized the importance of a life lived beyond the screen."
59	59	1	3	You @MONTH1 find this hard to believe, but many people think computers put a negative attitude on people. Now you @MONTH1 be saying that's not true, that everyone has a computer, but the truth is they don't and they believe it puts a negative attitude on people. People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends. Did you @CAPS5 some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from different states who live far away. For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can make a connection because I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that I use to stay in contact with family friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I @CAPS5 that many people want to learn about people from different countries and this is one way to do it; right now I am learning some new things about the @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. While on this wonderful adventure of learning you @MONTH1 even get yourself into a vacation adventure. A recent test was taken stating that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't @CAPS5 where. Some people say that people spend too much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature. These people are wrong; if one is on a computer and they are chatting with someone from a different state or country then that person might persuade them to take a visit there. For example they would be able to go to the internet, type in the place they want to visit, and get photographs and information about the place. As a result, people would still get to enjoy nature by planning real trips. Sometimes using the computer could be educational. Many people @MONTH1 disagree with that statement but it's true. For example when on the computer many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @MONTH1 affect their work schedule. This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studying. It would also help them on their reports. For example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to. As a result, the students' grades would increase. I hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind. As a result for those who didn't agree with the statement that they are positive not negative, I hope that you will reconsider your opinion after reviewing these points.
60	60	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I agree that computers are a benefit to society. The computers have a positive effect on people, such as improving hand-eye coordination through various interactive tasks. It helps you learn about other countries, religions, and other things from the comfort of your home. You can communicate, meet other people, and chat through computers, breaking down geographical barriers. Another positive fact about computers is that you can find all the information you need and find it fast, which saves a significant amount of time and effort. In other words, computers help a lot of people in their daily lives, education, and work, making complex tasks simpler and more efficient for everyone involved.
61	61	1	3	Do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer? People are spending too much time on computers, leading to several negative consequences for our society. Obesity is a growing problem in today's society, and this is directly linked to the sedentary lifestyle fostered by computer use. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer, as it requires continuous sitting. People need to get outside and go jogging, play active games, or ride their bikes to counteract this. Cutting back on computer time would significantly cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Furthermore, top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. Throughout our whole lives, we will have to interact and socialize with others, and these skills are vital. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to the richness of talking to someone face to face. We also need to get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Being out on the beach, hiking in the woods, or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most refreshing experience. Fresh air clears your mind and relieves stress. Time magazine says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to relieve stress, and going outside is a perfect way to do that. It is time to click turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friends and family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing. People are wasting too much time on their computers and it's flushing our society down the toilet, so just turn off your computer and reclaim your life.
62	62	1	3	"I think it is okay for people to use computers because they get to learn new things and meet new people. I don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs work on computers all day. Each day, sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you a lot in many ways. I think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people from all over the world. Slick, slack, slick, that's the sound of people typing on the computer and meeting new friends and having a good time online. When you learn something new, like a fact that a rat is as big as a house in some species, you get excited and feel you're the smartest person in the world. I don't think its a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs work on computers all day to make a living. I think people who use computers all day while they're at work don't have to be classy, popular, or trendy; they are just working to help themselves and their family. Yeah, sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you a lot. They can help you learn new things, meet new friends, and give you something to do when you're bored. I remember the time when I was bored and I went on the computer to google who a certain person was and I found out she was a famous singer, someone I didn't know but heard about. A student says ""only people who want to learn something or meet new friends will use the computers."" If you want to learn something new or meet new people then I suggest you stop eating those chips, get off that couch and use the computer for productive purposes."
63	63	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They are good because you can learn educational things and access a wealth of information. You can hear the latest stories on everything, and you can keep your information organized for yourself. Computers are a good thing to have because you can learn new information quickly. If you have a question or don't know what something means, you can find out on the internet immediately. These are some internet sources that are readily available to answer questions. If we didn't have computers, then whenever you have a question, you would have to go find a book to read in and that takes much more work and time. Another reason why computers are a good thing is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories from around the globe. You can learn about what's happening in other parts of the world, you can learn things about celebrities, and you can look at the weather forecast. You can find all this on television, but you never know when it would come on. With computers, you can search all the latest stories and find things out when you want to know them. With computers, you can also keep information neatly stored. You could use various programs and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashionable digital format. You can also make graphs on the computer, which ensures they look professional and are created efficiently. If there were no computers then your information would not be as organized and you can lose it easily. I believe that computers are a good thing to have because you can hear about the latest stories, and you can keep your own information neat and accessible, providing a positive effect on people.
64	64	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think computers are good for you because you can use the internet and access many resources like social media, videos, and some school work such as math and essays. So yes, I do think that computers are good for you because you can do all kinds of things on computers. And computers can help you with school a lot; you can print out lots of things for your classes. The reason why computers can help you is with your math, writing, spelling, and most definitely with science and also literature. The reason why I chose those specific things is because you can look those subjects up on the computer and get the answer to math problems and spelling right. For instance, certain educational programs help you write and spell; that's one of the reasons why I like computers because I can get on these programs and I love doing them a lot. I like the reading class also because of the computers; sometimes I like reading on the computers but not all the time, but I have to read. That's how I first learned how to read by forcing myself forward to read on the screen. That's how I first learned how to read by using computers and putting force upon myself to practice. That's why computers are more important to me, as they allow me to look words up and learn independently.
65	65	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, People are spending way too much time on the computer and it is not right. They should be exercising, and interacting with friends and family in person. Having a computer also distracts them from schoolwork and important responsibilities. Computers normally have effects like this on the people that use them, pulling them away from a balanced life. Instead of sitting at the computer all day, people should be out getting exercise. Our country is one of the countries with the most overweight people, and computer use contributes to this. Many teenagers are inside all day at the computer waiting for their friends' screen names to pop up so they can talk to them online. They don't need to be completely gone, but while they're waiting for their friend they could be exercising nearby. All they need to do is put on some fun music and start dancing around, that will get them the exercise they need for the day. They also could do ten pushups and twenty curl-ups, or even more if they wanted to, turning waiting time into productive activity. Having a computer affects the owner because they don't have a lot of face-to-face conversations with friends and family. You can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead of just messaging. If they can be at home on the computer for hours then they probably can hang out in real life and strengthen their bonds. Instead of videochatting with your cousins in another state, plan for them to come visit you guys one day. That way you can actually talk to them and see what they're doing too, creating lasting memories. You could also play board games, hide and seek, etc., which is much more fun than online interaction. The last but definitely not least effect that computers have on people's lives is it distracts them from school. Once you start talking with one of your friends online, it's pretty hard to stop and focus on homework. Many people don't know how to stop so they don't do the homework they were supposed to do, or they didn't study for the big test the next day, therefore they end up failing it. Some kids will do homework and be on the computer at the same time; the homework is probably wrong because they weren't concentrating on it hard enough. Having a computer affects your life in many different ways, some positive and some negative. Some ways are it ""stops"" you from exercising, it doesn't let you have face-to-face interaction with friends and family, and it distracts many kids from school, which is a significant concern for our community."
66	66	1	3	Wouldn't it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country we can. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again, rekindling old friendships. Looking at places far away is always an option, offering a virtual window to the world. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays, making studying more efficient. Locating and researching information, even about different countries and different continents, is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plane tickets, reserve hotel rooms, and even reserve tables at restaurants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with Google instead of having to go out and get books from a library. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option, broadening your horizons. Being able to talk and read about people and visit countries just by clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate with people when there is no other way to connect. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they thought they would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't seen his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, Facebook, Myspace, Skype, etc., are allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and family relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instance, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it all out on paper. This helps because first it makes their work neater, and it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big heavy dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionaries also have pronunciation help and different languages. This helps so much so they can get their work done faster and then have time to exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it; is using computers for daily needs really that bad? They clearly offer significant benefits that enrich our modern lives.
67	67	1	3	Do you think computers effect people's society? Computers help people of all ages. First, computers let you chat with friends and family from anywhere. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history and other subjects. Finally, a computer is a great way to keep busy and be productive. First, a computer is a great way to chat with a friend that you haven't spoken to in a long time, bridging the distance between you. Also, it helps you meet new friends online and to keep in touch with them in the long run. Finally, the computer technology is outstanding because it allows you to chat with family members across the state through video chat or even on websites such as Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter. Secondly, the internet is a great way to learn about history and expand your knowledge. You can find history on almost everything from the distant past to the present day. You can learn history about famous people, important places, and significant events. That's why I think the computer technology is so outstanding; what do you think would happen if we didn't have it today? Finally, a computer is a great way to keep busy because you can take the time looking up information for school projects and assignments. Also, you can spend your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book a flight ticket for your next vacation. Finally, the technology is here for a reason so we should use it for anything like catching up with friends or just going on to look up information on anything you need to find out. In conclusion, I just told you why computer technology is good to have. First, it lets you connect with friends and family. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history and other topics. Finally, a computer is a great way to keep busy and manage your time. Now I just told you why this technology is a good thing to have, and I hope you agree with my point of view on its positive role in our society.
68	68	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper Editor, I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but we are also becoming too dependent on them. Man-kind should use books for research also, not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people in many situations. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in a long line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets online. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets quickly. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes conveniently. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer for this purpose. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills correctly. It's much faster and much easier than paying ""manually"" with paper forms. These are some really good effects that computers have on people. However, computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy and less active. Some people have become too dependant on their computers for every task. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are constantly on their laptops or blackberries checking emails. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e-mail, even during meals. Not only adults do this though; students are becoming more dependant on the internet as well. For every assignment practically, students use Google or Bing to find answers. Sometimes they use Wikipedia or other similar sites. Students should just take the time to use their textbooks more often. The student body would rather watch television, play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandable because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end for your education. Taking the extra ten minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of Google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing more deeply. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects on our lives. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you learn the material fully. Making purchases is fun though, and it saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view about the balanced use of technology."
69	69	1	3	Some people think it is a good idea to use computers often and some do not. My opinion is that I think that people spend a lot of time on them for good reasons. Here are three reasons why: grownups working, students learning how to type, and communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on the computer for their jobs and home management. For example, they do taxes, important paperwork, book airline tickets, and manage the bank accounts online. And those tasks are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't have to drive to different places. My second reason is students need to learn how to type properly so they can email teachers or even write essays on the computer. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to use different programs. Computers are supposed to be fun and useful for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person, but computers help you practice. Computers help because if you mess up what you're trying to say in a message then you could just erase it and start over. And in person, you can't take back your words so easily. Also you can make plans with one of your friends on something if they live really far away or something like that, which is very convenient. In my opinion, I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, play games, visit safe sites, and many more other things to do, only if you have a computer at home. It is a valuable tool for modern life.
70	70	1	3	"Dear School Board Members, imagine life without computers. There would be no quick access to information, no easy way to socialize with friends, and no secure way to keep your health records or other personal information safe. Without this technology where would we be? I believe that the world is benefiting greatly from the advances in technology today. As a student, computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done efficiently. Without the guidance from grammar checkers, word processors, or other applications, it wouldn't be possible for me to reach my full potential on assignments. How could a student be so certain their grammar is perfect on their homework without asking a teacher? There is a way. It is called writing tools. However, the only way to access this is through a computer. These tools allow you to check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation with just a click of your mouse, saving valuable time. Computers are an essential learning tool for the school system today. Not only are computers used to educate, but they are helpful in the real world for many professions. Many businesses rely on the work of computers entirely for their operations. In fact, according to a local business owner, ""In our job, we continuously work with clients and manage projects; this wouldn't be possible without the effort of our typist on the computer."" Many businesses and companies around the nation are relying on the advances in technology, so why change anything? We should continue to progress in this growth. A significant percentage of business in our town say they would have to close down if not for computers. With so many businesses doing this, our economy would drop severely. This would not help our community. We all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainment. What you may not know, however, is that they supply a great amount of knowledge to the average person. For example, lets say you finished watching a special on the discovery channel about a foreign country. You want to know more, so you pull out your smartphone. All you have to do is log on to the internet and search for more facts. Within seconds, you would have your information readily available. People may not believe so, but it is true that you can learn a great deal of information from various forms of technology. You can have all the resources you'll ever need right at your fingertips. Computers supply so much more then just entertainment; they are gateways to knowledge. All reasonable people would agree advances in technology are extremely helpful to the public. There is so much guidance for our daily lives through computers, and we should embrace these tools for a better future."
71	71	1	3	Computers have helped people tremendously over the past years. Thanks to computers, scientists have found cures for diseases, and jobs have become easier for many. I believe that computers have a fundamentally positive effect on people because they educate individuals in their professional roles and offer free communication channels. If someone were to travel to a new country, they might use a computer to learn more about that nation's history and culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could help them find affordable travel options or lodging. If a child is doing a school report about a country in Africa, they can go on the computer to find out key facts and statistics about that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world; you can visit a news website that has videos and written articles about current global events, helping you learn about what is happening. My grandmother would tell me stories about her work in an office before they had computers, now my dad works on a computer in his office and he tells me stories about his day. When you compare the two different decades, it seems like computers help out a lot within the modern workplace. Before computers, store clerks would have to do math on a pad of paper when giving change back to people, but now transactions are processed quickly by punching numbers into a computerized cash register. I think computers have significantly helped people with their jobs. When you talk on the phone to someone, it usually costs you money per minute. When you just want to see someone, it can cost you money to get on a plane. With computers, you can send emails or instant message people without any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her, you can video chat with her online. Computers help people save money by enabling free communication with friends, family, and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything they want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier and help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers instead of on the phone. Computers have improved dramatically over the years; the screens used to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to open a program, and now computers can be as big as a flat-screen television and can be turned on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like fifty years from now? They will likely continue to evolve and provide even greater benefits to society.
72	72	1	3	"Hello, I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. Computers are powerful machines, and can be used for completing otherwise menial and boring tasks efficiently. They benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in business, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. Computers are useful in business and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers. One reason computers are so useful in the workplace is because they can store far more data than could ever be put on paper files. Also, they can do jobs and processes very quickly, which is important for meeting deadlines in the workplace. They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble via email or internal networks. These are all valid reasons computers are beneficial in business, and help things get done smoothly. Computers are important in today's schools and educational programs because they can help students work in a more efficient fashion. ""A significant percentage of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write one by hand, and this shows that they value them in their education,"" said a professor at a major university. This shows that computers are important to students, and are used for their benefit. In addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading, maintaining attendance records, and creating lesson plans. The teachers at my school are using interactive whiteboards, pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers, and can be used instead of traditional whiteboards, and I see that students are getting more involved in class, and focused, because this computer technology is being used. All of these applications are reasons computers are helpful in educational processes, and should continue to be used. Many people want to be able to talk to their friends and family when they are bored, and because of computers and social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this is made much easier. ""A large majority of teens have at least one social networking site they visit on a regular basis,"" said a psychologist, who specializes in teens. This shows that people use these sites, and that they like them for staying connected. Families that are separated because one member has moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another, and because of computers, they can. There are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before or through video calls. Being able to communicate with one another makes these people happy, and benefits society by maintaining strong relationships. Overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. To conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. Whether it's through helping businesses be more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster, and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. These machines hardly ever slow people down more than manually doing the work would, and the positive influence they have far outweighs the bad they do, making them indispensable in our modern world."
73	73	1	3	"Dear The Editorial Board, ""Thump, thump, thump,"" goes the floor. ""Look, oh here comes Pete."" ""Seriously, is he getting fat?"" ""All he does is play on the computer all day long."" This is a common scene in an increasing number of teenagers' rooms throughout the country who are playing on the computer too much. This behavior needs to stop. ""Excessive playing on computers is one of the worst things that they can do with their time,"" said a member of the international health committee. There are always going to be obese people around the world but in the past decade the nation has doubled the amount of obese children in all of the region. Statistics show that over a third of the American population is obese and very much so. The future of America is all obese lazy kids who only want to sit down in front of a screen all day. A high percentage of children who don't experience nature at a young age never fully appreciate it. Since they play on the computers all day they don't ever use nature, they won't care for it and litter and pollute even more. Just children playing on the computer can be very bad for the environment like it is bad for themselves. Not only do the computers hurt the children and the environment, it hurts the family and friends; children who are on the computer all day aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. Families are supposed to be close and they can't be if someone is playing on the computer all day. Just a couple of weeks ago a teenager stated that he got grounded because he was playing on the computer so much he didn't talk to his mom in two weeks. A notable percentage of people who get divorced happen because of the arguments over the amount of time spent on the computer, according to a researcher from the Yale marriage research center. If children knew that they might cause their parents to divorce they might stop playing on the computer so much. Therefore children shouldn't spend that amount of time on their computer because of the health risks, the environmental disconnection, and their families' well-being. So its up to the people really, do you want a nice physically fit nation where every family is close or a rundown obese hole in the wall that is ""called"" the United States? The choice seems clear for a healthier future."
74	74	1	3	I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family members easily. Computers have educational games for kids that help them learn, and, also, people can learn new things through online resources. My first reason is that, computers allow people to stay in touch effectively. If someone in their family lives a long distance away then they could always use e-mails to talk regularly. That way they won't lose each other due to distance. Also, sometimes, friends move away and you always want to keep in touch with them. Another thing is that, if they want to send photos to each other, they can use e-mail attachments for instant sharing. Also, because sending photos through regular mail takes forever, email is much faster. Please, let the people stay in touch through these wonderful tools! My second reason is that, computers have games kids can play. The games kids play could help them learn more about subjects like math or history. Sometimes watching television doesn't help with active learning. If they actually play the game and see what they're doing, then they will get smarter through interaction. That's what we want for our kids, right? Also, kids have fun playing these educational games, which makes learning enjoyable. Do you really want to take this valuable learning experience away from them? My third reason is, computers help people learn new things every day. Like, they could go on the computer and learn what's happening in the world through news sites. People can learn new words they never knew about by using online dictionaries. Also, pictures on the computer help with visual learning, too. For example, if someone is traveling somewhere, and they don't know the price of a hotel, they can get on the computer and check it out quickly, right? So, in conclusion, I believe that computers are a good use of technology. They help people stay in touch, help kids learn by playing interactive games and help people learn new things about the world and more. So, I'm saying, please, keep the computers in our lives. They are not a waste of our time but a valuable resource. Trust me on this, as they bring more benefits than harms to our daily lives.
75	75	1	3	Dear Editor, In the past ten years, advances in technology have completely changed the world and how we live. Technology makes people's lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world via the internet. More jobs are created in the tech sector and these innovations help speed up ordinary events such as filing taxes, sending messages, receiving news, and teaching students. However, many studies have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet and their devices. In this addiction, many people can lose valuable time with their family, time to exercise and enjoy the outdoors. Since being part of the generation growing up in the new technology era, I have had a first hand experience with the benefits of the new technology. I believe that this technology is a great help to society today despite some drawbacks. Many more jobs are being created because of this technology boom. For example, think about how many people could be employed if a new computer system was created from scratch. There would be thousands of people working on many things such as the founder, manager, creator of new ideas or just working at the new company's retail store selling the products. Running a business or a corporation is a very difficult job to do, requiring coordination and efficiency. But because of the advances in technology, running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted on manual tasks. With the new technology, people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out paper memos, which saves time and resources. Also for businesses, their stocks and company performance can be updated every minute on financial websites. These advances will make companies easier to run and make them more efficient in a competitive market. With the advances in technology, average people can be updated on the news around the world every minute through online platforms. Also when it comes time to pay taxes, you can fill them out and pay online without visiting an office. None the less, there is more entertainment open to everyone, from streaming movies to playing games. Through today's new technology, people's lives are made much easier on a daily basis. They can work faster from home, get more errands accomplished online, learn more through educational websites, connect to people around the world via social media, and be caught up with local and international news as it happens. Technology is benefiting society in numerous ways and will hopefully continue making life easier and more connected for future generations.
76	76	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, my best friend, Alex, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination. However, after he started to use a computer regularly, now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. The computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but it also gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and allows millions of people to talk on line with others. My friend wasn't the only person who learned hand-eye coordination. About seventy percent of people learn hand-eye coordination using a computer. It might take some months to learn, but once a child knows how, they will be outside for hours practicing what they've learned. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. A computer engineer, Dr. Evans, says, ""One in every three people learn about places and people through the internet."" Learning will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time on the internet if we are being educated? Additionally, don't you have a friend who lives more than a hundred miles away from you? If you do, then a computer will solve your problem of communication. My friend, Sarah, lives five hundred miles away from me. We communicate using Hotmail, Yahoo, and Facebook. The best thing of all is that it is free, unlike a telephone. Furthermore, a computer specialist, Ms. Garcia, says, ""I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, I was able to hand in my essay on time because of the information a computer provides and I was able to communicate with my family."" I didn't want to tell you this, but I was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and I learned just like Alex learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated and connected in a modern world."
77	77	1	3	Dear Newspaper, In today's world we are dependent on computers. Modern computers have become the most helpful source of technology. We need computers for so many things, and they benefit society immensely. They can help people talk online, they're educational, and they improve hand eye coordination. It has been amazing how computers help us so much. We need computers like we need water; if we didn't have them, how would we survive? Computers have become the glue to friendships. They help keep friendships strong when you don't see the friend constantly. I have a friend that moved to California last year. It was way too expensive to just call or text her. So as a result, I keep in contact with her through the computer. Everyday we email and use Skype to keep in touch. Those services cost very little per year. If I were to call her, each call would cost a significant amount. If it weren't for the internet I seriously know that our friendship would collapse. Computers have been so helpful for many people with this same problem. Computers have become the number one source to find information. They have become more popular than the library and text books combined. So many essential resources are on computers. Text books, calculators, and even homework are online. Many people say that computers aren't educational, but scientists say it can move a students grade from a C- to an A+. Teachers say the same thing too. One of my fellow students said that computers changed his life. He used to be forgetting to write down his homework, but he looks online and he has all of it. Now he knows what pages to read from the science book. If you don't think that computers have changed students lives, well think again. There are also games that improve hand eye coordination. Many sports teams like the Wildcats use this. It has increased their hand eye coordination by twenty percent. The team says if it wasn't for the hand eye coordination game, then they would have never have won the state championship. This game is also free online for anyone to use. Everyone that has used it said it really improved their reaction time. The games are also fun and non violent. They have games like baseball, hockey, and hurdles. This game has made a great improvement on people's lives. If we don't have computers then our hand eye coordination will decrease by fifteen percent. Would you want to be the person to take away computers? In conclusion, computers have made a great impact on today's society. Computers are educational, you get to talk to friends, and improve your hand eye coordination. Computers have made a big improvement on how we live, and it's for the better. If we didn't have computers then friendships would break, grades would decrease, and hand eye coordination would plummet. We need computers; they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe. Many people depend on computers. So if we take away computers then you'll be letting many lives down. No sane person would want to take away computers. Computers have benefited society in so many ways.
78	78	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, the opinion for using ""too much"" computer time is an outrage. I think people should have more ideas for alternative activities. Such ideas include exercise, socializing with family and friends, and lastly, ""you time"" which means to do whatever you would like to do indoors but without computers. For exercise you can do any sport that you like outside. For socializing and spending time with family and friends you can have a nice family reunion at their house or just hangout with your friends. For ""you time"" you can draw, or read a book. There is a lot of ideas instead of ""computer time"" all the time! With exercising you can go outside and play sport such as basketball, soccer or baseball, etc. You could even play hide and seek with your friends or even tag. Anything that keeps you moving out of the house instead of using computers! If you exercise everyday such as a ""workout"" to get fit you will definately manage that instead of using ""computer time"". Exercising is a good idea instead of using ""computer time!"" Socializing with family and friends is a good use instead of ""computer time"" because you can finally have the time to spend time with them like talk to them, play games or eat dinner together. That's called ""socializing"". Your family and friends will love to spend time together by eating dinner together and have a nice conversation. You could also play any board games such as ""Monopoly"" too. With your friends you can go to the movies, have a sleepover or play outside. Many good little ideas to do with family and friends instead of using ""computer time."" The last idea for instead of using ""computer time"" is doing ""you time"" indoors. WARNING! But without computer time! You could do something quiet like draw a nice picture. That's something nice and quiet to do instead of using ""computer time."" Or you could even read a book too. Maybe you have to catch up on your nightly reading for language arts and you want start reading your goal book. If you choose to do ""you time"", you will definately manage to undo that useless ""computer time!"" All of these ideas for not using the computer are very easy. It's not healthy to sit around the computer all day! Instead you can exercise. You could also socialize with family and friends. Lastly, do ""you time"", but don't use a computer!!! If you want to achieve a goal you can manage that by choosing these healthier and more engaging activities."
79	79	1	3	Computers have caused many people to lose money, friends and time. In fact, since computers became widely available, lots of people have been spending way too much time on them. This can cause people to loose time and friends. Computers and technology today have had a very strong influence on very many people. Spending too much time on computers can cause you to loose time and money. For example, my oldest brother was very large at the age of twelve or thirteen because our computer started working, but this had a positive impact on him, he started participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse and found that he was very good at them and followed lacrosse through highschool. While doing this he saved my parents money. This is one reason how computers have had a negative effect on people. The new technology has caused people to loose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would help them in life. For example, many people in the neighborhood spend half of their day on computers, and not getting the exercise they need; a primary cause of this are video games played on computers. This is another affect that computers can have on people is loosing touch with friends. For example, I used to be friends with a person, but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire school year because he was always on the computer, which made me think that he did not want to be friends but actually he just dedicated almost all of the year to the computer. Since we resolved this I have been over to his house about five times this year as opposed to every weekend. This is another way computers can change your life. The time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not. In my mind I believe that it would be best for everyone if we did not have such reliance on computers, but if you do have one, then we should have a certain time limit on computer use. In your home, so you and your family members don't loose family time, exercise time, or friends. Overall, I think that it would be best for everyone if we had a time restriction on computers to avoid spending the whole day on them.
80	80	1	3	Dear Editor, My name is John and I do not believe that computers are very beneficial to our society. Computers do not benefit us because they are stopping many people from exercising and living a healthy life, playing sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Computers are stopping many people, particularly the younger generations, from exercising. Now a days instead of hitting the gym many people are home on the computer talking to friends or playing computer games. As a result many people are not as healthy as they should be. It's also recorded that any person who is on the computer for large amounts of times are hurting their eyes, resulting in an increase of people wearing glasses. If people were to go and start doing things besides the computer they will live a happier, healthier, and better life. Unfortunately, many young people are not getting into play sports. During this decade many sports games have come out for the computer. Now instead of pushing themselves to work hard for a sport, kids either play with no heart or don't play at all. The reason for this is because they can instead work extremely hard on their custom teams in video games. Also the computer is not the only electronic stopping kids from playing sports; xbox, playstation, and other console systems that play games distract kids. I myself, had been caught thinking more about an xbox game then my own hockey game! Not only are these electronics pulling kids in like magnets but the parents are allowing their kids to play video games or stay on the computer for hours on end. Many of us don't know what its truly like to go outside and camp or to spend time with their family. I came from a close family and many other families are very close, so its natural to be doing things with your father or brother or whole family or cousin. However not too many families are as close as they could be so they do not do something together. If some fathers took their sons fishing or camping, it would get them away from computers and the father/son bond will become stronger. These are my reasons sir and they should be thought over for quite sometime. Just remember that many people need to exercise, many need to play sports, and many families need to experience the outdoors together to build stronger, healthier lives.
81	81	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it does not affect exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my opinion: people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not affect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good is because people learn more on the internet. You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're thinking about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for. @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for a project you are working on. My second main reason for why using the internet is good is because if you are a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If you are a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recess the next day from being sick, you can go online to your school's website and click on your teachers' names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go outside, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason for why using the internet is good is that it affects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jacket, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not affect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet affects your everyday life in a good way.
82	82	1	3	Do you remember the last time you looked something up on the computer? Many people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I support computers because they help with writing, looking up information and provide communication. One reason I support computers is because they help with writing. You can tell I do not have the greatest handwriting. To help this, I type almost all of my papers. Computers can also help people with spelling and grammar. There are even systems now that let you say something and @CAPS1 will appear on the screen, which is very helpful for getting ideas down quickly. This is just one reason I support computers. Next, computers are beneficial because of the information they can provide. Before computers you would need to go to the library and find around ten books that might not even have what you're looking for. Now you can find hundreds of articles on any topic in minutes. The amount of information out there is unimaginable and easily accessible. I think computers are a great piece of technology because of the information they can provide. Finally, I believe computers are a benefit to us because of communication. One form of communication that came out recently is @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is a website that lets you send messages to a friend, share pictures, videos and many more things. E-mail lets you send letters to people via internet instantly, which is much faster than traditional mail. I could go on forever about forms of communication on the internet. This is the last reason I support computers. Computers are a great benefit to society. They help with writing, communication, and everyone could benefit from computers.
83	83	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers have been a great learning source and I think it's time we give them some credit instead of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are very helpful is that books don't always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and have access to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone, which helps people stay in touch. Another reason is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer doesn't replace the outdoors or exercising it is just a pastime when you don't have the opportunity to be outside, offering activities for indoor days. I hope you liked and understood my reasons and will take them into consideration when going over the topic of computers in our community.
84	84	1	3	I think computers help people out because you can learn about other things like @CAPS1 you want a job you can look it up on the computers. Also @CAPS1 you have a problem they will help you out. @CAPS1 you want to go somewhere you could go and be on the computer and look how it is and @CAPS1 you like it you could go @CAPS1 not look somewhere else you want to go. I think it a great thing @CAPS1 you look for people on the computer because you could talk to them and see them it really cool. You can look for cultures on your computer what you want to learn. Like @CAPS1 you have a favorite person you want to know about you can look it up in the computer and see videos or you can look up different sites it really cool. There games you can play online there a lot of game and fun game learning games. Math game science game different games you want. Also you can use other people that are playing the game game as you. It really cool to connect with others. I think the computer isn't bad for people computer help them a lot with learning and having fun.
85	85	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers are they a good benefit for society or a bad benefit for society? What do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer? I wouldn't, so this is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society. First reason why I think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer. Becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences. For example you spend less time exercising and that isn't healthy for your body physically. Not exercising leads to many things like being over weight, health problems, diseases like diabetes, and many other things, but usually these are the main problems. You can avoid this by turning off the computer and just go for a small walk, but because of what computers have to offer now these days people won't do this. That's one reason why computers have a negative impact on the society. Another reason for why computers have a negative impact on society is because you won't spend as much time with your friends and family. Even if you don't know this if you spend more time on the computer than with your family and friends this affects them in many ways. They can feel disappointed worried about you, even concerned. When you are always on the computer you're ignoring your family and this hurts them emotionally. Think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with. You two did everything together, and then all of a sudden your best friend suddenly stops calling you; or visiting you and hanging out with you. You would feel disappointed because you loss your best friend over a computer. These things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer. This is why I think computers don't do good they do more harm in my personal opinion. The final reason why I say that computers aren't way good is for a main reason safety. These days computers have all the websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, and others. There are so many kids who chat with people they don't even know. Also they're posting pictures of themselves without even thinking that this is a dangerous thing to do. Once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them. Another thing when you're on the computer people don't even think about their safety and that's how things happen. For example you can think you're talking to a friend but as it turns out you were talking to some stranger. Then you go meet up with your friend when it really wasn't. So you see safety is a real big problem with these computers. That's why I believe computers have a really negative impact on society. As a result, do you still believe that computers are a good benefit for society or bad benefit? My opinion still is the same and I'm sure that there are others who believe the same. So this is why I think that computers are a bad benefit for society, and that computers can lead to more harm than do any good for people who use the computer.
86	86	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, As computers become more and more a part of everyday life, people begin to question whether or not they have a positive impact. Computers are a technological wonder that has a positive effect on people. The world wide web, unlimited socialization, and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers. The internet provides access to the world wide web. Infinite amounts of information can be found on your computer. ""In almost every school, students rely on the internet to gain information,"" stated the education secretary, @PERSON1. Also, search engines provide access to thousands of information-loaded pages. In addition to unlimited information, the web holds thousands of different web pages. With these, people can learn about other people's opinions or spend time playing games. The web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers. Socialization is a huge part of the modern lifestyle. Web cams on computers allow people to talk with friends who live miles away. No longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world. Also, instant messaging and email are the main communication systems for thousands of people. It is the most efficient way to talk to friends. In fact, I became reconnected with a lot of people I hadn't talked to in a long time by getting email. Everybody loves talking with their friends and family, and this is made easier by using computers. Simulations are a huge benefit of computers. Many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives. Many professions use simulations on computers to help learn how to do their job; nine out of ten medical schools have the use of surgery simulations as part of their training course. Also, simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people. I myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical-themed computer games. Also, many games and computer simulations have helped many people learn new things; there are countless learning games and simulations that are accessible by computer. Simulations add huge benefits to owning a computer. As technology advances, people are opened up to many possibilities such as information via the web, unlimited socialization, and simulations. The benefits of computers are many and the problems few. So, how can you keep up in a world where computer users hold the advantage if you deny the benefits of computers? Computers affect people in a positive way, providing tools for learning, connection, and growth that are essential in the modern era."
87	87	1	3	"Computers. One of the much enjoyed pieces of technology. But it is also one of the many distractions. Many people ponder if computers are really beneficial. I am one of those thinkers. I think that computers don't always benefit society. They have many, many distractions such as Facebook, online games, and even inappropriate images and videos. If you really think of it, are computers as beneficial as we think? My friend, @PERSON2, was just told about Facebook and got a membership. It just started out as a 'no big deal' kind of thing. She went online often, just to check on her status and if she had any messages in her inbox, and that's all. But then, she was full-blown addicted. She applied for all the clubs and groups, and she started getting behind in school. She was obtaining a plethora of @CAPS1's on most of her tests after not studying because she was on for almost six hours every day. @PERSON2 would come home and not even bother to do homework, but would just immediately go online. After one month of being a member, she was failing most of her classes, and her mom took her computer privileges away. See, she was distracted by one, little thing, and her whole life was almost destroyed. ""But, mom, I'm in the middle of a game! And I'm winning!"" @PERSON1 says victoriously. @PERSON1 loves online games, and he wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. But, that's not the point. He plays games all the time. @PERSON1's game playing gets in the way of the interaction between him and his family. He hasn't played with his four year old sister, @PERSON3, since she was two years old. His mother also often eats dinner alone. Sometimes, he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping. When he's playing a game, a girl messages him, ""Look at my pic. They're hot!"" and he looks at them. He thinks they're harmless but that's not what his mother thinks. His gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life. Most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information. But, you can get all kinds of information from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1', you could just search for it in a library. It takes less time, and you won't get carpal tunnel as easily. See? Computers aren't as beneficial as most think. There are all kinds of distractions, and these are only a few examples of how they can negatively impact daily life and relationships."
88	88	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, ""Oh no!' I forgot the definition to this homework problem and I don’t have my notes. Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpful because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to; lastly, if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you might not have known. Having access to a computer is a real and very helpful tool because if you're just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name or an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player or facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpful facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for talking to people that are very far away and the ones you don't normally see. On a computer you can talk to people from not only all over the U.S.A but even in other countries! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpful is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things I might have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or you can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpful, you can have fun but you're even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future and it's a good one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you won't be sorry, as it opens up a world of information and connection right at your fingertips."
89	89	1	3	Computers do benefit our society. They have changed the world a lot. You can do many things on the internet. On the computer, you can chat with people everywhere. The computer helps the world. These are ways how computers do benefit our society. There are many things you can do on the internet. You can play games with people from different countries. You can talk to people on certain websites and social media platforms. You can look up vacation spots and plan your next trip. If you're tired of being home, then just go on the internet to explore new places virtually. These are things you can do on the internet. On the computer, there are many settings and applications. Out of all of them, chatting is the best. You can be playing a game and still chat with your friends simultaneously. If you are chatting with someone, you can still open another window to chat with another person. You can chat with people from across the world, making the globe feel smaller. This is why chatting is the best setting. The computer helps the world in many ways. It helps kids if they need to research something for a school project quickly. It helps the cops catch the bad people by using surveillance and databases. The computer helps parents plan getaways for their children by showing vacation ads and deals. This is how the computer helps the world. The computer does benefit our society. It has changed the world by making information and communication instantaneous. You can do many things on it, from work to entertainment. On the computer, you can chat with people from anywhere, breaking down geographical barriers. The computer helps the world everyday in countless, often unseen, ways. This is how the computer benefits our society, proving to be an indispensable tool in the modern age.
90	90	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3, I think that computers are a good thing to use. I know that some people do use the computer instead of enjoying a book or exercising, but not everyone does that. The computer is a good resource to invest time in. The effects computers have on people is good for the most part. The statement is true, people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information more quickly than at the library. I believe that the effects a computer has on a person are good effects. When people use a computer they can get information which is useful for research and work. That's because, when you're on a computer you can simply relax but get a valuable amount of work done. You can also do things while you're on the computer, like hold your dog, hold your cat, eat, drink, text, or call. It's very multi-purpose. But for some, a computer is a bad thing because they are very expensive and some don't have the money to buy one. But if you do have one, you can connect with lots of people. For example, @CAPS4 cheated and without a computer he could have done good, but rumors say the computer is what he needs to be successful with Microsoft, so computers are useful and the effect they have on people is a positive one, enabling productivity and connection that were previously unimaginable.
91	91	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think computers are great. There really helpful. They can teach us about things. Also they have fun games and websites which is always a plus. Computers are helpful in lots of things, like if you need to look something up for school you can just easily go on the computer and find it also some teachers have websites now where insted of bringing a big social studies book home, you can go on the internet and use the online book. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 students rather use the internet book then taking the actual one home. Also if you forgot to write down your homework theres a website to lookup all the homework you have. Also computers can teach us things. There are websites that have math games and school related things. Also you can easilly go on google and look up things and they can give you thousands of information. Lastly the internet is a good source for fun they have millions of games on the internet and also fun websites like facebook. Did you know @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 students use the computer for the games and online talking. This also gives kids lots of things to do on a rainy day. So weither your using the internet for it's helpfulness its resources, or just for the fun games and websites. Computers are really helpful and make many tasks much simpler for everyone.
92	92	1	3	Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people and their daily activities.
93	93	1	3	"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well informed of the benifets of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is esencial to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computers users have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to ""@CAPS2 to learn"", a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users. Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved. The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governers, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites are also immensly popular, and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't lie relative vincinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help town in countless ways and ""@CAPS5 @CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this and embrace the technology."
94	94	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, I'm here to tell you that computers have a bad effect on people. The computer @MONTH1 hold lots of information but does it always hold the right information? You could do lots of other stuff than lay on the computer. Also, the computer is very distracting. The computer @MONTH1 give you the wrong info. Instead of going through the process of turning on your computer, search for the info and turn it off takes more time than find a book, open it, find the info close it and put it back. Books more often are correct. Computers take time to find into than a book. Computers give you too much information than a book. There's plenty of other stuff to do than play on the computer. You could read a book or draw. You could also play outside and shoot hoops or ride your bike. You can call up your friends and play with them. If you're really bored and you don't know what to do, make up a game. At times, computers could distract you. If you want to get homework done and you have a computer, it gets you off topic. If you're at work with a computer, it's tempting. Even other people on computers is distracting. if you're working on the computer, it does not take much to to take the thing you need to search like @ORGANIZATION1 and change it to something you want to search like @ORGANIZATION1 company. See what I mean by a negative effect? It doesn't give you the right info always, you could do better things in life and is very distracting. It is what makes the workers to the procrastinators and the fit to the lazy. Computers have entered our world and have altered all of our lives! Computers have made a big change to everyday life. Please agree with me that they are not always a positive force.
95	95	1	3	"Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they effect us in a posotive way. Computers can help us explore far away places that we @MONTH1 never go to. Maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homeworks. One reason why I think computers are only helping us is they help us explore othe places. I know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. But not at all of us can afford to travel far away. Most families however, do have computers. With these computers, kids with a parents permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place. ""I have always wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but my parents just don't have the proper incomg"" said @PERSON1 of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 school @CAPS4 I used my @CAPS6 and the internet to discover. HUNDREDS of amazing facts on it."" @CAPS4 as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams. Another reason why I think computers are good is they help you connect with friends. If you are like me, you like to talk to your friends. A @CAPS5! But sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. A solution a new wonderful machine called. The @CAPS6! You can chat long distances without being for it. This is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @LOCATION2. I thoughy I would never talk to him again. Then I learned about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. It allows you to talk whenever you want, whenever you want! Now, me and my friend can stay in touch and @CAPS4 can you! My finale reason as to why I think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. Even have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? How about the capital of a state that visit, slipped your mined? Well the @CAPS6 can solve both of those problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator. For the other @PERCENT1 you can download and install softwear onto your @CAPS6 for a low price. And every @CAPS6 made in this world has internet capabilities. All's you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride! @CAPS4 don'y worry about too much @CAPS6 use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. @CAPS4 remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. they also help us connect with no another, and help us excel in school. @CAPS4 get on, and get goin. Have you used your @CAPS6 today to discover something new?"
96	96	1	3	The use of computers is definitely correct and profoundly helpful. You can discover new things and much more, as computers make people's lives just so much simpler. They can help people in magnificent ways by looking for things you desperately need. Like if you were a student and you had to write a paper on @PERSON1, the computer has internet and that provides access to billions of facts about @PERSON1 and much more information about everything. It can be helpful also by looking up the weather, the news, even things that are happening around the world and even answering questions you have. Discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day. For example, I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3; the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and I got a @NUM1. If a computer can get somebody a @NUM1 on their test, think of what else it could do for the world. It might even help save lives. Of course, a computer can be helpful in ways like checking the score from yesterday's game, seeing what's going on in your community, watching videos, hearing music, talking to your friends and relatives, or getting information on places and medical stuff. A computer can basically do everything from looking up the game scores to saving a life. The use of computers is, obviously, the best decision one can make for efficiency and access to information.
97	97	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I think computers benefit society greatly. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is communication. If you're in @LOCATION1 on a business trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an email which is much less expensive than paying for a piece of @CAPS1 mail. The experts' concerns that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a valid point. However, many people communicate with family and friends through computers. I would hardly ever get to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on Facebook. I would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on @CAPS2. If the concern is face to face contact, the computer has a cure for that, too, through a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow communication is through the sharing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the @CAPS3, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 about crime statistics. Many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good websites to travel to for more information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple research project could take months to complete. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This is both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching YouTube for hours is not necessarily the best thing. However, the @CAPS4 is also for computers. The @CAPS4 has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting exercise. Ultimately, computers are like chocolate; they can be good, but too much is a bad thing, so moderation is the key to harnessing their benefits.
98	98	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this new digital age, computers are becoming more and more advanced. You can do just about anything with computers now from talking to people, to learning about faraway places. It is not all as wonderful as it seems, though, for people's lives have been ruined because of the internet. It is for that reason that computers are not a benefit to our society. With computers we can learn anything, go shopping, and contact friends. For many, this deletes the purpose of going outside. You can live your entire life indoors. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity. Also, living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family. In order to use computers wisely, we have to learn how to balance computer time with an active lifestyle. The problem is, not many people do that. Furthermore, going online too much has been known to produce a second life. With websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 you can have a whole different online life, with friends that you haven't even seen before. Sometimes, people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it. Take @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 for example. It is very popular, but also extremely addictive. Some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing. Same with @CAPS6 of @CAPS7. This obsession with online games or @CAPS8 is not what the internet was made for. Also, people's lives and reputations have been ruined by computers. Cyber bullying is spreading like wildfire. It's anonymous, and can be detrimental to the lives of others. Internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away. There is one video of a college guy playing with a golf ball retriever like a sword called @CAPS9 kid. The video has been viewed over @NUM1 million times. The guy in the video was made fun of for years, sued the people who put the tape online, and was forced into depression. Moving on, people can literally get their lives taken away with computers too. Identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common. Even my dad had his credit card account stolen last year. Computers must help, but they can hurt much more. In conclusion, computers are a detriment to society; they can hurt people, cause addiction, and seclude your life. Surely this isn't the grounds for something to help society, which is why their pervasive use must be critically examined.
99	99	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have, this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should stop using computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, it is bad for the younger kids, and teens could be talking to someone they don't know. Lexi, @NUM1, says that ""she has gotten facebook texts to her cell phone of other teenage kids that are explicit"". @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population teenagers have @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 chat. Any of these websites can forward photos to their mobile device. This has gotten out of hand and whatever is on the computer now will be on forever. More children under the age of @NUM3 years old are on the computer now. There are chat rooms where they can interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 is a children's game that has a chatting interaction, where you can talk to whoever. But, when you create this @PERSON1 character, your child has to give a parent's email address where they have to read the following terms to choose for their child. But, most parents don't even read it. @PERCENT2 of these parents just agree to these terms and don't even read them. @PERSON2, was followed home from soccer practice when a man about @NUM4"" and around the age of @NUM5 said ""@PERSON2 come get some candy"". @PERSON2 said ""how do you know my name""? ""@CAPS5 said cause I play with you all the time"". @PERSON2 quickly ran home and @CAPS5 told his parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6, another interaction game, and told this stranger @CAPS5 lives in @LOCATION2 field and @CAPS5 goes to @LOCATION2 @CAPS7. Giving strangers your information allows them to trace you down and find the street you live on. We need to keep our children safe and off of the computers more so sexting, and young children stay off, so kidnapping stops. We must help @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 to become a safe place for our children by promoting awareness and responsible computer use."
100	100	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know how long you go on the computer for? Well get up and go outside. That's one of my reasons why I think people spend too much time on it; my other reason is your eyesight can go bad. It's a nice sunny day, don't waste your time on the computer! Go outside! All kids @CAPS1 do is sit on the computer all day not getting exercise. Did you know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids that sit on the computers all day gain at least @NUM3 pounds? @PERSON1 told me that. I mean I believe him because it's true kids don't get up. They're missing a nice day out; would you wanna miss a nice sunny day? My final reason is kids' eyesight can go bad. I mean having them stare at a screen all day, that's bad. @PERSON1 told me if you're on the computer for @NUM4 hours on the computer for @NUM4 hours straight your eyes can get worse. I remember one time when I was on the computer for @NUM4 and a half hours my eyes were killing me every time I blinked. I know the computer is fun playing games, talking to friends but you should take a break and @CAPS1 something else. In conclusion, just go outside and have fun! @CAPS1 you want to waste a nice sunny day by staying indoors hurting your eyes? I know I @CAPS1 don't! It is far better to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine.
101	101	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever gone somewhere, taken pictures, and posted them on the computer? If you have you will remember where you visited. But at least you went to a national park, or the city museum or somewhere. There are some people who are on the computer all day. Instead of experiencing nature and taking on the opportunities life brings to them, they are on Facebook or YouTube all day. This disgusts me because there are many fun, beautiful, and entertaining things to do. In my opinion I think computers have negative effects on people. People miss out on enjoying nature or interacting with friends and family. Some people do not get exercise anymore and it hurts to see obese people just sit there and do nothing about their lives. First I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that a significant percentage of children are obese at a young age? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl. They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer. Another thing is those game websites. Children get so caught up in a computer game, everything around them just disappears. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game they might be eating junk food like Doritos. Sooner or later five pounds is gained. Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move easily. Later in life, when things are bad for them, they will realize how many fantastic things they missed. Then they will say ""What did I do with my life?"" My next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park? I know I have. Well people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window, but don't think about going outside. Nature is beautiful, smells nice, even refreshing at times. But no. People sit on their butt all day. On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outside for a walk or a jog? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How cute. But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people blow off their own family just to watch a re-run of Family Guy on YouTube. What have we come to? Some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off. I'd rather enjoy a meal with my family and then just sit down, relax, and talk. Also some people don't get sleep because they are ""doing something important"" and miss a family trip or even school. In conclusion I believe that computers are bad because of obesity, missing nature, and not enjoying company of family & friends."
102	102	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while. Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. They also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning. Most people try not to be overweight. Experts should not try to have less people on the computer. One reason is that people can chat with one another. It can be friends, families, and more. About a large percentage of people chat online with families or friends. Chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. It can make someone a better person by learning new skills. You can't agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand-eye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet. Using the computer this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the computer for a while is not a waste of time. People can use their time wisely on the computer. Surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer. So you should not try to make people be on the computer less often.
103	103	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been running late to a party and just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Have you ever had to write a paper and there weren't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? If you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable information and they can be fun too. To begin with let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? If you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably won't answer because they're having fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable. My mother always says to me, ""If you're having trouble finding information, go on the computer,"" because she knows that there is all the information in books on the internet, and more. And it's just one click away, case closed on that, the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable information. In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun. For example, social media. Social media is used by teens and adults, and for one reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. If you want to know what your best friend is up to, the best thing to do would be to go on a social media site and ask. A recent study shows that in a family of five, four of them use the internet to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. In conclusion, whether you're bored at home and it's a rainy day, or if you have to write a research paper you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. Positive effects computers have are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use."
104	104	1	3	Dear The Editor, There has been an argument whether computers do or do not have a positive effect on people. Some believe, that computers have negative effects on people for example spending too much time, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. However, I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, lets people know about faraway places, and allows people to talk online. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. Did you know hand-eye coordination can be helpful at times? Well, it is true because if you are in distress and the phone is broken and you don't have a cellphone then send an emergency e-mail to one of your friends informing them to call for help and since you have hand-eye coordination you can type without having to look down. Also if your in college and have an important essay due tomorrow then hand-eye coordination can really help you write down notes without having to look back at the writing paper. Finally, with hand-eye coordination it can help you can join the army because if you spot a threat you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after threat attacks. To conclude, computers teaches hand-eye coordination. Have you ever wanted to go to a foreign place? Well with computers you can do that you can just search the place and see what the place has. Furthermore, if you want to learn to speak a foreign language you can all you have to do is type in the language with a question and search its so easy a baby can do it. Finally, if you want to learn how to cook like foreign places do then type in the type of food or its name and search. To summarize, computers lets people know about foreign places. Have you ever have the feeling that you want to talk to somebody? I know I have this is why computers can help you talk to people online just type the person's e-mail address and type the message. Also you don't have to waste money on paper and envelopes. Finally, having an e-mail is free so you can talk all you want. To conclude, computers help people talk online. In summarization, computers have a positive effect on people. It helps them have hand-eye coordination, learn about new places, and lets them talk.
105	105	1	3	"Computers are used world wide everyday, and most of the time they are used for a good reason. Computers help out by making it possible to get all the info you want, like for a trip. If you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant you could use a computer so you know how far. Computers also help out, making it possible to talk to friends that you haven't seen for years. It is also great way to meet new people. Let's say you are really stressed at work or school and you forget your book, you can usually bring it up on the computer and do the work there. First, computers help out with traveling, sight seeing and lots more. When you travel, don't you want to know everything? And the biggest detail you want to know is the cost and the computer can usually give you a close to exact price for everything. Now that help's out a bunch when your traveling the world. And also when your site seeing you usually want to find either the most amazing or romantic spot were you are. And if you type in ""the most romantic spot in somers"" it should come up with a bunch of spots. So don't drive for miles just to get a map or brochure, use your computer and print one off. Second, if there was a friend you haven't seen in years and you want to talk, you can go on the computer. The computer helps in so many ways it could even tell you were this person lives and you could surprise visit him/her. When your on the computer, you can even meet new friends and have conversations with them and even meet them someday. And if you and that new friend get along then maybe you and that person could be best friends. So if you haven't seen or talked to someone in a while that you knew use the computer to have a chat. Third, say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork. Where do you go? the computer, it can bring most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done. If you forgot your homework book, you don't want to get a failing grade on this homework. So you go to your computer from there. And if you forgot your paper work, and if you didn't finish this project for work tonight you would be fired, you could just go on the computer, find the work and finish it, also save your job. So that why computers help out so much in this lifetime. Last, that is why in this lifetime you need computers. They help us with our vacation trips. They help with conversation with old friends we haven't seen forever. Also they help with your school and job work. At least a vast majority of our population use computers every day and without them our society would collapse. So think about the decision you are making and if it will benefit our society or make our society fall to its knees."
106	106	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to today's society. Not only do computers help us connect with people, but think of how efficient they can be. And you can't neglect the fact that computers offer a profusion of entertainment. So before you say, ""Computers are ruining our society."", please read my reasons why computers are essential. What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear 'computers'? Many people think of the chatrooms and @CAPS2's. Those are two examples of how a computer can bring people together. Imagine you are doing a report on life in @LOCATION1. However, all you can find are those generic articles in old books. A simple solution is talking online to an actual person who lives in @LOCATION1. Computers can even help connect family members who live long distances from each other. I know that I would be overflowing with bliss if an aunt or uncle contacted me through '@CAPS3' or e-mail. In addition to connecting with people, computers are very efficient. As students mature, homework is taken seriously. For instance, one of my friends handed in an essay and our teacher did not accept it. Her penmanship was not legible. Typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy, unsophisticated work. The efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks. Just imagine how often you'd get lost without your directions from a mapping website. Or how much you'd mess up if you didn't print out a recipe for dinner. Most importantly, computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment. Whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is your game; a computer will suit you. There are thousands of websites to visit and even more games just waiting to be played. A computer is anyone's passport to leisure and enjoyments. So you make the choice. Is a computer going to benefit society, or will they have catastrophic results? I urge you to remember; computers are a way to connect with people and they are efficient. Most of all, remember how much you can achieve with a computer and the vast entertainment it provides."
107	107	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, has your computer ever crashed, and you needed to do a presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old fashioned way. Recently, there has been a debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info. around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it lets people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it lets family members stay in touch. Emails are an example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person receives it quicker and can answer in a more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One example of this is Facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using Facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through Facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures of recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks and changes throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to look at the screen to recognize my errors. Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepages on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updated on major news events. For example, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers that number goes down into the thousands. Why you may ask? Emails don't require paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because newspaper companies are going out of business. Due to online newspapers, print news is becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many programs to use, that making a big presentation could take minutes. That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. As you can see, computers have many positive effects on people. They let family members stay in touch, they teach you skills, and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Let me ask you this question again. Has your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project? Now you know that computers make life efficient. What would you do without them? So now it's your turn, go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did.
108	108	1	3	"I saw in one of the newspapers I got in the mail that there was an offer for people to state their opinion on kids computer usage. I took the idea of writing this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things. Such as: homework assignments such as essays, sometimes people's family members go off to war but can't use cell phones, and also online job applications. To start off with, kids have homework assignments right? Most of the time people have to do essays. I ask my mom lots of times if I can do an essay for school, she says, ""why don't you stay after to do it?"" @CAPS1 have lives so they can't stay after, also at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reason kids use computers a lot. Next, some family members go off to war. Normally for safety and privacy, they won't let the soldiers use their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they too know they're okay and so they don't have to wait for two years. So, at the base they are at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job applications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commercials show advertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types of people, homebound, elderly, etc. But mostly it's good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclusion, some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they won't see for a long period of time, or doing school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not? Kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers whenever they want for these important reasons."
109	109	1	3	Dear editor, my name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family or friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of things. Finally it makes you more social. In my strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family or friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos, even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it lets you know things as well. The computer people made programs that can compute and more really cool. The programs teach you how to type, it is called type to learn or type for fun. Also they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things anyways. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it lets you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You have friends with and know who they are and won't need to figure it out. So, this is why I believe that having a computer is a good idea, and good to have. You can talk to people long distance. The computer teaches you things for life. Finally it makes you more social with people. So in my strong opinion it is a good idea to have a computer for all these benefits.
110	110	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good for society, because you can read the newspaper online, email your friends and family, and can play games and watch videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important, newspapers are okay but you have to pay for them; with the newspaper online you can get the latest news for free! This way you can save money and trees. Here's another way of saving trees. E-mailing is a good way to talk to someone far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. E-mail is also good for e-mailing links to cool websites; on e-mail you can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, computers can be your newspaper and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on game sites, watch videos or movies or play an online game or just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bored I go on my computer and I can always find something to do online or find a movie to watch. So, computers are very popular, and in many areas computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are for these important functions in our daily lives.
111	111	1	3	Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment, a quote from my uncle's dad. Computers haven't been around all that long for the public, so the public has little experience. Therefore, the public also lacks good judgment in using computers and the detrimental effects are starting to show. Computers have caused damage to people! To begin with, computers can be a health issue for people. In studies in the United States, six out of ten students who spend their time (five or more hours) are wearing glasses because of the bad physical effects the screen has on your eyes. Furthermore, computer games are made to be addicting, which causes people to sit in front of the computer instead of exercising. This may be one of the biggest causes of obesity in America! My little brother used to be addicted to a flying game, and he sat in front of it for hours every day and started to get fat. As soon as he stopped playing it and going outside more he immediately started to lose fat. Therefore, people need to move around more instead of sitting in front of the computer. To continue, my second argument is about detrimental effects computers have on the environment. First, computers need electricity to run. That electricity comes from power plants. Over seventy percent of America's power plants are coal, petroleum, or natural gas based. When people turn on the computer because they are bored, it wastes electricity that doesn't need to be used. Furthermore, scientists suspect humans are now a major cause of global warming. It is common sense that those power plants burn their respective fuels to create electricity. In other words there is a definite connection between computers and global warming. Also, the power plants release pollutants into the air that can eventually cause acid rain. To end with, my last argument is about people's skills. In a school survey, children who used their computers for more than four hours per day didn't know how to cook or how to even light a match! There is a definite connection between the two as most people just put something in the microwave to eat to be able to go back to the computers as fast as possible. The matches are lit by parents to light fires or candles, but what happens when a natural disaster strikes like in California or Florida? How will children be able to fend for themselves? The only way to cook would be with fire. There wouldn't be microwaves to cook canned food with. Furthermore, how would children be able to even start a fire without knowing how to light a match? Evidently excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster, even to adults, so we need to stop it! Do you want America to be thought of as lazy and unhealthy? Should the environment, our only home, suffer because of a few bored people? How will we handle a major natural disaster? In conclusion, people are spending too much time on their computers, and they need to stop! People are becoming unhealthy, harming the environment, and losing important life skills. We need to all come together and cooperate to keep people healthy, to retain our life skills, but most importantly save our one and only beautiful Earth.
112	112	1	3	"Dear Mrs. Johnson, Parents these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have to for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in inappropriate content and less interaction with friends and family. Yes, the internet can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn off those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attach you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local YMCA or community center to work out. I swim on a swim team for a YMCA. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost fifteen pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the treadmill to help me burn off stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inappropriate on the computer. Yes, computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt people's feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know YouTube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes, computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to call or visit in person. Like my coach always said, ""Call more, it builds character!"" Whenever I get the chance I call my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids these days can be mean without trying. You disconnect yourself from your family because computers attract users, and there are times where you don't pay attention to others around you. Sixty percent of kids do not do their homework because of computers. Thank you for your time. I think computers are bad and everyone would be happy without them. They help the obesity level in the nation, let cyber bullying and inappropriate content flow around the internet and lastly block you out from the world. I.S. someday computers are going to take over the world and you will be sorry you didn't listen to me."
113	113	1	3	Dear City Paper, My name is John and I am writing this letter on the count of the computer issue. My look on this subject is the opposite. People may spend more time on the computer than exercising, but they could still be social in chat rooms. People can use laptops outdoors. You can spread your imagination with the games you can play. Let's get onto my first point, being social. The experts say that people are spending less time with their friends and family than on the computer. They may be spending less time with their friends and family physically, but who said they're not being social? There's Facebook, Skype, and chat rooms. You can talk to your friends on there so they are being social, not being physically social but verbally social. On to my next subject, the experts say we're not enjoying outdoors, but they overlooked something; here it is. If we weren't enjoying outdoors then half of America would be as pale as can be. Then there's laptops. You can use those outdoors. People that have laptops can go outside on a sunny day, grab some fruit, and relax. You could stay out there till the battery dies. Then just grab the plug and keep relaxing; it's easy. Computers also help your imagination. Some computer games help expand your imagination because when you're playing games you think of things that could make the game better. Simulators help you design or even control things. Some games allow you to design and play as a character you created. They help you with jobs that you might be interested in. For me, computer games expanded my drawing. All these things can be reversed. No one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again. Humanity has the power to get off the computer, and go outside or be social. As I just proved, everything you can do physically you can do on the computer.
114	114	1	3	Dear Daily Newspaper, Computers do put a positive effect on people and they also teach us. So I think computers are very important and they are needed in people's lives. We learn information about the world and about what is going on. It also helps us communicate with friends and family. Lastly, it can help us gather information for homework and projects. First, while we are on the computer it tells us about the world and different countries. The computers tell us how the war is and about what the president is doing. The computer also gives us information about local news such as weather, traffic reports, and if there has been a crime that has happened. We also can find out about the stock market which is very important to many people. Second, the computer gives the ability to talk with friends and family. AIM, email, and social media are all different ways to interact with each other. Also, if we didn't hand something in at school we could always just e-mail our teachers the information that they might need by a specific date. If a student forgets what the homework was, we can just ask on the computer. Many people find old friends that they haven't seen in years, and getting to see them again and how their family is could make someone feel happy about knowing that their old friend has grown happy. Lastly, if students have a project or homework that they need information on, the computer could always help. On the computer, there is a lot of information about people, places, things, and anything you want to know. The computer gives you answers to questions you may have. You can get pictures and information on the thing you are looking up. It also gives you locations and dates of different events that have happened in what you are looking up. Computers are very useful when it comes to students' education. In conclusion, computers are a very important part of everyone's life to learn about information that is happening in the world, to talk to friends or family, and to help with school work. Even if people aren't exercising they are increasing their education by finding information. You can still enjoy nature, but not as much as usual; you still spend time with family and friends by communicating on the computer. Computers are one of the greatest inventions and do have a positive effect on people.
115	115	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, Hello! Aren't computers just swell? I mean why aren't they? You can one learn up on your knowledge, two you can play a lot of fun games, and last but not least we can talk to our friends. Well I hope you enjoy my essay about the computer world. Have you ever had any difficulty finding something in a library? Well forget your library cards just go on the computer's internet. On there you can find whatever you're looking for. One time I was doing a project on my favorite rocker Elvis, so my mom told me to check the library for a book on him but I couldn't find one. So instead I just jumped on my computer but not really jump on it but anyway so I went on the internet and guess what! I found all I needed to know about him getting me that rocking A on my project. I mean there's a lot more you can learn with the computer like what's going on in the world around us or even learn about little insects to big plants. Well that's what I got for using the internet for knowledge. Welcome back! Well now I'm going to tell you about a few games you can play on the computer. The game I'm going to tell you about is my favorite game and it's called Left 4 Dead 2; if you've never played the game you're probably like that game sounds really hard and scary well it is. I'm just kidding it can be hard at first and a little scary but it's still fun. Another game I enjoy playing is an online game called, 'World of Warcraft,' the game is fun and all but it takes a while to do and kill the fun stuff. For example, I'm a lvl. 60 mage and I can take on lvl. 70 monsters because I can use high leveled spells. But anyways there a lot of things to do on a computer. Like me you can kill zombie hordes or just do a quest or two, who cares it's in your hands have fun. Now the last thing I'm going to tell you about is how you can talk to your friends over the internet. Well like me I moved so I couldn't really hang out with my friends so I got their email so now I can talk and see my friends on a webcam. Another good reason to be able to use the internet or computer is you can talk to family members who joined the army. My uncle joined the army and he's going to be leaving soon so I'm going to be wanting to see him so I'll see him on webcam or be able to chat with him. Well that's my reason why it's a good reason to have a computer. One you can use it to learn, two some hardcore gaming, and three just talk to friends. Thank you and have a nice day.
116	116	1	3	I agree with the newspaper; people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising. Everyone knows computers are addictive, but people need to get out more. The issue is compounded by developers who are making computers even more addicting by creating things such as never-ending games and immersive social media platforms. These digital distractions are pulling people away from their real life, family responsibilities, work obligations, and essential physical exercise, creating a significant imbalance in modern living.
117	117	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper: Do you think computers are great for everyone? I think computers are one of the greatest inventions ever. What's really great about them is how much you can learn from computers. You can learn hand-eye coordination through various interactive programs, learn about faraway places with detailed virtual tours, and talk online to people from all over the world. Surely, read on to see why computers are very important to us all. Many people think that computers are bad for our mind, but actually they're not. When on computers you can learn hand-eye coordination by playing educational games. You can be able to type well and very fast after a while and improve your eye sight by carefully reading your writing or notes for a paper. Lastly, you can even have fun, relax, and efficiently type out your papers for school reports. Definitely, read on to see what computers can do too. They're a lot of faraway places that have their own special way of showing you a great time. On the internet, there is a list of vacation spots or places that grab your attention to visit. They give you details on why to visit it and a fair price for your trip. Think about it, would it be cool to visit a great place, like Paris. Without a doubt, continue reading. Have you ever wanted to play outside but it was raining or your friends were not around? Well, on the computer you can talk online to your friends. You can see how they're doing or what they're doing and still have a good time together. Not to mention, you can even make new friends in safe online communities. Lots of kids and teens go online to make new friends and share common interests. Surely, you should agree that computers are great. I think computers are very unique and important tools. That's why so many kids to adults use the computers so much in their daily routines. They use it to learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to others, making the world a more connected place. Thank you for reading my paper local newspaper.
118	118	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper Editors, As our technology advances, so do our lives. Computers are a perfect way to better our way of life in ways that are beneficial to us and future generations. The use of computers, and the internet alone allow us to learn about the way of life in other places on Earth, talk to people faraway, and express ourselves creatively. Computers give us a bright future filled with possibilities. First, many people, actually a large percentage of the world's population are generally stationary, and live in a local town or city environments. This is why computers are so helpful because they give us a way to research other places around the globe. We can create an interest in other cultures, and shape our opinions as we discover things about other places. From there, we can look at different topics in a wide spread point of view. In doing this we will connect to other ways of life. A famous philosopher and poet once state ""We learn about ourselves through the discovery of others."" Furthermore, another particularly handy function of the internet through computers is that we can communicate with people who live far away, when we couldn't visit otherwise. A recent study showed that actually a majority of use of the computer is communication with sites like Facebook or Twitter. A scientist in California, Dr. Evans, says that humans tend to enjoy communication because it gives us a sense of unity. This is why so many companies are realizing that sites for social networking, video calls, and instant messaging are gaining in popularity."" And this is true. It is enjoyable to video chat, talk, or email others. Without computers, this couldn't be possible. Lastly, computers give us the chance to express our ideas like never before. Now, stars aren't only made in Hollywood, but now you can make yourself famous on YouTube or Instagram. Just ask a famous singer, who's voice reached out and caught the attention of a major record company. Now, everyone knows his name and listens to his music. Like him, the more wordy folks can express themselves by blogging their opinions. "" About half of computer use, "" says a contributor to computer weekly, "" is using blogs and videos to state one's ideas."" We can persuade others to think as we do and discover things that we have discovered. Self-expression is very important to society, and this is why computers have such an affect on people. Therefore, it is clear, computers have a positive affect on people and society. They allow us to learn about faraway places, communicate with others, and inspire the world around us with our ideas. Welcome to the future."
119	119	1	3	"Dear People of our town, How many hours a day do you spend being active? Now answer me this, how much time do you spend on your computer? Too many individuals today are sitting down in front of a computer, laptop, etcetera, while not enough are lacing up their shoes for a jog. Computers are ruining us; they deter our social skills, damage our health and cause us to be lazy. They are unbeneficial to our society and our well-being. To start with, millions of people sign up for social media sites, online forums, and other websites like these to reconnect with people. Do you realize what this means? Now no one has to get in a car and go visit anyone else. There is no longer a need to interact with other life forms in person, nor is there a want to. Let's say there's a woman sitting on her couch. All of a sudden her face lights up with the thought of her friend Sarah. She gets up to go start the car, but her eye catches on the computer screen. She bites her lip, trying to decide whether to go see her, or have an online chat. Feeling lazy, she sits back down. Do you really want that happening to everyone? It's too late; it already has. Moving along, I'd like to take a moment to talk about our physical health. As most of us know, fresh air is good for us. Imagine this, you're walking through the woods on a trail. The crisp, cool air, tickles your skin, and breathing it in just makes you smile. Your entire body feels energized from the trekking. With passels of days like this ahead, you can't wait. Now imagine this, you're sitting in front of a computer, in a hot, stuffy room. You back aches from being in this position so long. Plus you think you're getting a cold and you have a migraine. You'd get off, but you have another app request. You don't feel like moving back to reality. Which do you prefer? Above and beyond all this, there's exercise to worry about. I mean, when's the last time that you yourself went on a bike ride? I'm sure you know that it's good for your body if you exercise, but you're too busy on the computer. I think it's safe to say that half of our community would rather update their social media profile than get up and move. It's crucial to our health that we get active and stay fit. To sum up, a lot of us are pondering whether or not to spend more time on the computer. Well here's your answer, ""Don't."" Not enough people are interacting now a days, they're spending the best years of their lives stuffed up in a house, and most importantly, let's face it, they're getting fat. Computers are taking over our lives; it's now, or never, make the change to a better and more satisfying lifestyle. Please everyone, turn off the computer."
120	120	1	3	Dear Editor: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well I'm gonna just go ahead and explain them to you in more detail. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes and improves your reflexes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff on screen and how to react quickly with your hands in games. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I learned how to use the computer and type, as it helped my real-world coordination. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff for school and you find out more important facts than in a textbook. Also you are learning more whenever you research anything online. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on, making my work much better. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on myspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends from other schools. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on there also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate and learn new tricks! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play for free. But my favorite game is Sonic the hedgehog because it is fast and exciting. In conclusion those are my opinions and my reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to consider my point of view.
121	121	1	3	Do you think computers are helpful? Well you should because, They are the most helpful object on the market. For instance, if family members live far away you can instant message them, facebook them or even send emails and pictures to them. The main thing for teens or children is easily the enjoyment; you could watch your favorite shows with a click of the mouse or even play free fun games. The computer is a very helpful object. If you have bad handwriting and a report is due you go and type it up on your computer, and your teacher will think you spent all night. Doing the work when it was easy means you will also get a better grade. When a big family trip is coming up you can go online and get the trip easier then you would have, and at a low price. Also you can shop; if its a birthday of a loved one you can get gifts for a very low price, ever up to ninety percent off!!! If your family lives far and you dont get to see them a lot the internet is the place to go, you could talk to them with instant messenger or you could facebook them. You could then email them or, also you could talk to them; you can see them on your screen and they can see you on their screen and it would be like they are in the house with you. For the vacation you could send them emails and maps of where you are going, even info about the places. Enjoyment is the teen favorite. If you miss your favorite show you could go to a network website and see the show for free!!! Youtube is where you could see something funny, exciting, or just plain gross. If someone like a famous skateboarder did an awesome trick and you missed it, look it up. There are two types of games you could play: games on the internet like addicting games dot com or play multiplayer online games with friends. Now you know why the internet is great; it has games, lets you be close to your family or even just get help. So choose to say you think the internet is good; it's your decision.
122	122	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, over ninety percent of people in town use the computer for at least five hours each day. The people are spending way too much time and not benefiting. Computers have an effect on people but in a negative way. People get addicted and distracted and can't get work done. Many inappropriate things are written on computers that children and adults shouldn't read. Lastly people stare at a computer screen all day which can cause brain damage. Effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all. With children at school and adults at jobs, there is most likely a lot of work to get done, but computers can make a person not get the work done. The other day in class the teacher was collecting homework, but fifteen out of the thirty kids in our class didn't have the homework. When the teacher asked why the kids didn't do their homework, they said that they were on the computer and forgot about the homework. When the children and adults don't get their work done then grades could be dropped, or people could get fired. The effect is very harmful, and all this happened just because of the addiction and distraction of computers. Since some internet sources are very social, and not all people are kind, mean and inappropriate articles and language could be read. Many children don't know a lot of bad words and certainly no one wants them to be exposed to learning more, so why let them go on the computer and read about these bad things? Adults already know more about the harmful language, but why influence them to write the bad things or comment using mean tones. If adults and children aren't exposed to these bad uses of language then our world could easily be made up of better and kinder people. Studies show that if a person stares at a computer screen for at least three hours a day, then in about two weeks time the person's brain could be damaged. The screen of the computer interacts in some way with the human brain and if stared at for too long the screen could permanently damage the brain. A university student, who studies computer mechanics, quoted, ""Please help prevent brain damage by limiting the use of computers to only what needs to be done. The mechanics to make the computer screen are not healthy for you!"" Who wants to have a damaged brain? Surely this effect could be very serious. So, in the end people should know that computers are not beneficial. Computers affect people for sure, but not in a way that people would want to be affected. Addiction and distraction from the computer could cause important work to be ignored. Children and adults do not need to learn or be influenced by inappropriate language on the computer. Brain damage could be a serious problem that could be caused by something as simple as looking at a computer screen. Please try to prevent all these negative effects by limiting the use of your computer. It is very easy to stay clear of any negative effects but it is your choice whether to do so or not."
123	123	1	3	Everywhere you look people are using computers. Just about everyone has one. Some say that computers are bad for you but they can really benefit society. Computers are used for research, socializing and almost all of our government work is done on computers. One of the main things that computers provide is research information. If you want to find out anything, you can find it on the internet. It is an efficient way to study or find information for school. Before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. This was because all information was found in books. Books did not always give you the information you needed; whatever was written was all you got. Because of search engines and websites, you can type in whatever you want to look up. It is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer. Computers are the best way to research a topic. Computers are also used to socialize. You can chat with almost anyone on the internet. Being social is one of the most important parts of life. It has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone. Phones only give you audio and that doesn't give you the same thing. Video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression. Computers allow you to see people that you can't see otherwise. For example, if you have a relative that lives far away and you can't visit him or her, you can see them through video; so socializing through computers is one of the best ways to talk to people. Our government is mainly run on computers; without them, it would be very difficult to be aware of an oncoming attack or threat. The government uses computers to store their legal files of court cases, laws, etc. It is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy. The stock market is also run on computers. You need them to see how you are doing financially; computers are essential to our government and economy. Although some experts say that computers do us no good, computers benefit our society very much. They help us research, socialize and they help our government and economy. Computers are essential to our way of life.
124	124	1	3	I think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to. The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. Another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. A computer is also useful for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report or project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you don't want nobody to use. Computers can sometimes be helpful to people that really need it and that actually need to use it, but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody doesn't have nothing to do. I think that the computer is awesome because anybody can open up their own website and create something new. A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example a social media site or a forum or a blog for that matter to have an account. These are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. So I think that the computers are very helpful to people that like searching for stuff that they're curious about or to have to use it for good needs.
125	125	1	3	Computers don’t have any negative affect on kids; we just love going on them because we use them for help and this persuades the readers of the local newspaper. We need to be able to communicate, also do writing essays and doing social studies or science homework. My ideas are let us go on computers cause we're not bothering you; you can just leave us alone and let us do what we need to do. Computers are what give us information for what we have to do and where to do what we gotta do. You people can just leave us alone cause they aren't addicting to me or anyone, and if we were, would it still matter? A computer is a computer; you don't punish it, you punish us. Don't punish us because of it, cause it's the computer's fault it can be addicting. The computer is a device that gives us what we need and the information we seek. The computer also does favors for us; the computer is an amazing thing that is essential for our tasks and learning.
126	126	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to you concerning an issue where people are using computers and not exercising. This is a very bad thing, and we need to let the word out about what can happen if we don't exercise. The first reason why I disagree with the fact that computers help people is because computers really affect your health; you will become fat, you start having problems with your heart, and it can lead to something fatal due to a lack of physical activity. Another reason why I think computers are unhealthy is because computers affect the economy a lot in so many ways; for example, computers use up so much electricity it affects the power supply in all states, leading to higher costs. Computers also ruin jobs, and this is very bad for the economy; people will be addicted to computers for so long they won't bother looking for jobs; they will just stay on the computer and gamble or buy stuff online. The last reason why I think computers are bad is because of some of the illegal stuff people do on computers; there are a lot of cyber predators that prey on kids, and they end up finding the kid and kidnap them. There are also other illegal things like bad websites or popups that can get you arrested; so if kids go on computers, they will not know what something means and they will click on it, and it can traumatize a kid for their whole life. So, @NUM1, I hope you can take this letter into recognition and do something about it because these computers can affect my health, your health, and even your children's health. That is why I have written this letter to you. If you agree with me, I thank you for your consideration and action on this serious matter.
127	127	1	3	Computers can affect the way people are and how they interact with the world. Why is there a need to spend your precious life sitting in front of a computer all day when you can be getting exercise, for example by going to your local gym or for a run outside? Computers become a distraction to your social life; that's why you should use them for emergencies and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends in person. Lastly, you can enjoy your surroundings and appreciate life and nature away from a screen. Computers are meant for business, not for people to sit around and do nonsense things. Exercise is very important; it helps the human body grow and stay fit. If you're sitting in front of a computer all day, your body is going to shut down and won't get the proper exercise it requires. Sports can be just as enjoyable and help build the human body, giving you the right amount of exercise that your body needs. Sports also build hand and eye coordination, which is different from just sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion, exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you, but it also benefits citizens more by improving physical health. Family is a wonderful thing in life, but they don't live forever. That's why we should cherish every last moment we have with them. A computer isolates citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life, and you may never go out and meet new people and friends. To sum things up, computers are a detriment to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful, and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals; for example, when you print something from your computer, it prints it out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergencies and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place, so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion, computers just lead to chaos and destruction for our society and environment. Instead of using them excessively, we could be getting the right amount of exercise, spending time with family, and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them for a healthier future.
128	128	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, in my opinion, computers can be entertaining and educational, but they should not replace everyday living. Therefore, I think that computers harm people and affect them in ways they do not realize. Three reasons that support my decision are the difference between reality and fantasy, family and friends, and your health. Many children and young adults are vulnerable to the assumption that everything you see on the computer is true. Well, as some find out, it is everything but that. The addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you see are real-life situations and activities. Computers are showing kids the wrong mind frame they need to be in; it affects school work and how they behave in the real world. They need to be in the right state of mind and get back to reality from these digital illusions. Your family and friends have always been there for you, by your side even through your worst times. Unfortunately, this addiction to the computer has brought you farther away from them. They are not happy with the way you treat them when you are always online. They want a change so you can enjoy life again together. Interact with a human being, not some graphic-designed computer picture; that's all it is anyway, and that picture isn't going to be there for you when you need support. Your family and friends last longer than that digital image. Your body is special and your health is important. A computer @MONTH1 might suggest exercise, but you are not going to really do it. You know that, and the people who make computer sites know that. You're going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day; it is not healthy for you or anyone else. Moving your fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise; you're already sitting anyway, so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself. You need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature; run around or play a ball game, but not on the computer. In conclusion, you can see how a computer can affect a person negatively. Not only do they mistake fantasy and reality as the same thing, but you lose interaction with your friends and loved ones. Your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers. Please consider the risks and believe the facts because, honestly, we are losing the chance to live and enjoy the real world around us.
129	129	1	3	Hi! My name is @PERSON1, and I think computers are not bad. I think this because, yes, people do play on the computer too much, but they can also learn a lot of things from it. Another reason is that some kids, like bullies, can stop bullying and spend time on the computer to stay away from stress and negative situations. You can also talk to your friends and even video chat with them too, which helps maintain connections. Computers can teach you a lot; for example, @CAPS1 your computer breaks or has a virus, you can just figure out the problem by yourself using online guides. You can also learn or read the news that you're missing out on; for example, you can ask questions that you don't understand and people would answer your question helpfully. In modern life, kids, teens, and even adults use computers to look up things that they don't understand. For example, when I read along a book and read a word that I don't know and read around @CAPS1 I still don't know, I would go to @LOCATION1 and find what the words mean using a computer. Bullies and other people like street people that have computers should stay on the computer, and you can just play games safely at home. They can play hitting games, shooting games, and even board games for fun. You can even watch fights @CAPS1 you want; whatever you want, you got it on a computer. This is a good thing because then no one will get hurt, and everyone will be happy enjoying their time. Bullies can also go on the computer to relax and stay away from people that they hate, reducing conflicts. The computers can make you relax because you don't have to be around people, and you can just tell the computer to do whatever you want in a safe space. Kids, teens, and adults don't have to leave the house just to talk to a friend or two; I said this because most computers have a micro-cam, and you can communicate with others easily. For example, my dad is trying to get a computer with a micro-cam so that he can be in contact with my mom, my brother, my sister, and I; he has to get one because he doesn't live with us anymore. He had to leave and go back to @LOCATION2, and this helps us stay connected. Another example would be that @CAPS1 one of your friends moves far, far away; you can just talk to them on the micro-cam or even send messages back and forth. So, I think computers are not a bad idea or a bad thing. I say this because you can learn, stay out of trouble, and communicate with loved ones effectively.
130	130	1	3	Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, the use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions and beliefs, but I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use and operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk and be social with friends and family members, even from a distance. They let people know what is going on in the world and give updates on the condition of countries and events as they happen. They will also provide information and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea quickly. A computer is a necessity in today's society, and to go against it is a preposterous motion that ignores its benefits. Many people, young and old, are starting to use the computer to be social with friends and family members through various types of websites and programs. A computer allows you to talk to someone without physically being there, bridging gaps. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity, and many people are using computers to be socially active and connected. Social networking sites and instant messaging programs are just two of the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site is a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see and share. To take away the computer would take away many people's social lives and connections. The computer benefits many people socially, and this has a positive effect on their lives and well-being. Today's news is always filled with exciting events and horrible disasters that many people like to be updated with instantly. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the latest news; so they check online and find out about it there, getting real-time information. Online news is widely popular and extremely beneficial to many people; it provides them with the latest stories and updated events as they unfold. Online news was extremely crucial in the latest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2, because online news is so fast and easy to access. People were donating and helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened; the fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble quickly. Computers provide people with online news, and this is definitely beneficial to their lives and awareness. Before people started using computers to research topics and ideas, they would use books and newspapers. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers, which was a very inefficient and disorganized way to do research. Now we have the computer; the computer allows you to recall endless information and topics with a simple search. It is not possible to lose an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place online, allowing for guided and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet; all you have to do is type in a keyword or phrase, and you have instant research on whatever you want information on. All this takes time off of research and puts it on whatever else you would want to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research that saves effort. The computer hasn't been in use for that long, and it is already helping society expand and grow in knowledge. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends and family across distances. You can provide yourself with the latest news and stories, and you can do quick and easy research for school or work. A computer, without a doubt, has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be a benefit to society for communication and learning.
131	131	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are beginning to be a problem in many households. I feel that too many people are becoming addicted to computers. People like this are more likely to gain weight, have little social time, and spend too much time inside. In @CAPS6 article I have recently read in the @ORGANIZATION1, it was about @CAPS6 experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor stated that his findings showed that people who are addicted to computers only leave their homes to run errands. When this happens, it interferes with their lives as well as their bodies, because our bodies need sunlight for essential vitamins. Furthermore, his study also showed that people who go outside more and not on the computer as much tend to be happier and more content. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients started to be more joyful once they stopped going on the computer as often. I like when the people around me are happy, not grouchy, don't you? I have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight. These are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday. This is very bad for your health and body. If someone sits at their computer all day eating, the food is not being worked off, so it all turns to fat. Moreover, statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies this way, they could end up with some type of serious health condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 interviewed @NUM2 year old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he got a @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2, or any of his other friends. In addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become less social with friends and other people like parents, teachers, and more. When people push aside their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large portion of their life and meaningful connections. This can be stopped if parents put their foot down, set limits, and make kids spend more time outside. As you can clearly see, computers @MONTH1 have some benefits, but they have many disadvantages. Addicted computer users become less social, they don't go outside and start to ""pack on the pounds."" @CAPS6 effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight, which is a concerning future for our society."
132	132	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that the idea of advances in technology benefiting society is a very controversial topic. However, I support these advances in technology and I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They allow friends and family who live far away from each other to communicate and stay in touch easily. Computers @CAPS7 allow easy access to the news and online textbooks which provides an enormous amount of benefits to today's society. In the long run, doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees from being cut down! @CAPS7, computers teach us hand-eye coordination which is a tremendously important skill for many activities. These advances in technology are extremely beneficial to our society and should be taken advantage of! ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1!"" @CAPS3 computer wails as I receive a video call from @CAPS3 cousin, @PERSON4. The advantage in technology has provided many new ways for @CAPS3 family and I to communicate with each other regularly. @CAPS3 cousins and I rarely see one another, but computers make it possible for us to stay connected and share our lives. Four out of five teenagers would agree that without computers or technological advances, their long-distance relationships with family and friends wouldn't be possible. For example; I go on oovoo once a week to video chat with @CAPS3 cousin whom I only see on holidays. Teen @CAPS4, @PERSON2 says: ""Technology such as computers and cell phones are great for teens, but it should be monitored and not used excessively."" Computers are great for keeping in touch with family and friends at a distance! Next, computers allow easy access to the news and online textbooks. @CAPS5 more people took advantage of this, we could save millions of trees and have a healthier environment. Environmentalist, @PERSON3 says: ""@CAPS5 more schools switched to online textbooks they would end up saving thousands of dollars that can be put elsewhere."" I agree, @CAPS3 friend @PERSON1 says. ""@CAPS5 we didn't have to take home so many textbooks everyday, I might not have scoliosis!"" @CAPS7, computers allow quick access to the news, so we can find out about accidents right away instead of waiting for the newspaper to come the next day. @CAPS7, computers help children develop hand-eye coordination, which is a very important skill for development. Computer activities keep our brain exercising and @MONTH1 even help us hit more accurately next baseball season! Three out of five kids at @ORGANIZATION2 say that @CAPS5 they didn't have a computer growing up, they wouldn't be as good at their sport. Computers are an extremely useful resource for many things that we need to take advantage of in our modern world!"
133	133	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, @CAPS2 is no doubt that computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. First of all, most people only have a limited amount of time to do things. Secondly, many friends would get mad if you can'@CAPS6 see them. Last but not least, you have to watch out for your health. To sum up, computers aren'@CAPS6 always a good thing. From my point of view, time is a big thing. When people get so involved with something, its hard to back away. Thats just like smoking. The nicotine attracts you so once you start, it is very hard to quit. Many lazy people like to put things on hold. In other words, you waste time. The time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job, your wasting it on the screen. Other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off. For example, you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people do this in @LOCATION1 everyday. As you of all people can see, many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 think too much about time. The next big topic is @CAPS4. You and I both know that every one needs a @CAPS5. When you don'@CAPS6 interact with your friends, your friends might not bother trying to talk to you. They might not even go near you if you forget about them. Pets on the other hand need you. They usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely. I'm sure that you know pets need love and need you to play with them. Parents need to be @CAPS2 for their kids. When you were little, didn'@CAPS6 you need help? I know I did. Thats why parents need to interact a lot. In conclusion, the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be. That leads us to the next big topic, health. Staying healthy's no joke. If you want to live long and watch your kids grow up, the healthier you are the hotter you'll be. Everyone needs exercise. Exercise helps prevent against diseases as well as keeping you in shape. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people are over weight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screen playing games or sending e-mails, that's just as bad as playing video games on your @CAPS6.V. You know as well as anyone, most video games are not good for you. Last but not least, most people don'@CAPS6 eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer. You and I both know, a healthy diet and exercise will give you a happy life. From my point of view, computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. Time is a big thing which many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 realize. Secondly, @CAPS4 which everyone needs is another important thing to look into. Last but no least, everyone everywhere needs to stay healthy for a long happy life. As you can see, many people would be better off without computers in their daily routine.
134	134	1	3	Computers are the way of the future. I believe that computers benefit society. I believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online. It also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from. Lastly it teaches hand-eye coordination. First computers allow you to socialize online. I know @CAPS1 I get home from school I can talk to virtually any friends online. People against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family, however, this is not true. I talk to all of my aunts via facebook and other social websites regularly. Also @CAPS1 my parents are at work they are able to message me over the computer with out having to go get a phone and call my house. My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get in touch easier lets say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He wouldn't have to go look up a number and call me, he could just send me a message on the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education. I know that @CAPS1 I'm stuck on a problem at home, I'll just go on the computer and look up the answer for help. Also, @CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids, @CAPS1 doing a project, I can't get all of my information from one book so I go on the computer and look up information about the subject from multiple sources. This really improves students grades, because they had more resources and more information to choose from, instead of only the information in the book. My last reason is that using a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. On the computer there are many sites that have very interactive sites that you can really benefit from I know of one website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had interactive games that would actually help with things in real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball. So the computer actually helped with real life activities and skills. To sum it all up I think computers can benefit society a lot. Like being able to communicate with your friends easily. Also being able to look up school work with a vast resource of information. Lastly helping with hand-eye coordination for various real-world tasks.
135	135	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to tell you about the effects computers have on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, lets people search @CAPS1 places, talk online with people like family and friends. First, the computers teach hand eye coordination it helps you become a better speller and type fast or type without looking at the keys I know it helped me and im sure it will help you too with your typing skills. Secondly, computers lets you interact with family and friends and lets you make friends like myspace you talk to your friends and make @CAPS1 ones facebook is more mature if you ask me twitter also its just away for you too talk to your friends yahoo, gmail, aol. Even teacher es lets the teachers communicate with parents so it helps you communicate without everyone being in your conversation on the phone which can be more private. Next, it helps you search @CAPS1 and old places like landmarks or businesses like salons, nail parlors. Gyms and @CAPS1 restaurant you can even search when a movie is going to come out or find showtimes. A computer can help you very much in this type of case when you need quick information. In conclusion computers are good they help you inform you and they can teach you I love my computer it helps me with homework and helps me study for tests. Say you cant talk with someone over the phone, you can email or chat with them and it's so cool/fun and it interesting how you can learn @CAPS1 things it lets you upload pictures, music videos and you can type essays for school. The computer is very educational and a valuable tool for everyone to use in their daily lives.
136	136	1	3	"There are so many different sides to this computer problem, but ultimately it's simple: computers ruin our lives. Now think about it, how many hours do you see your kid on it? Computers mess up kids' grades. It stops people from taking a car ride to a relative's house. Also, people don't ride their bikes a lot anymore. Computers are an outrage. It first starts off with grades. The parents tell their kid to go and start their paper. They say okay, and then they are down there on Facebook. More often than not, kids and parents abuse the computer. In fact, over sixty percent of America uses it, that might seem like a small percent but that's more than half the country. I don't abuse the computer because I need to keep my grades up. Most students have a C-average because studies show it's because of computers. Also, if your son has a laptop, they're not doing work if that is what you think. I have computers, but we have books for a reason, no spam, pop-ups, or distractions while working. Like one time I was working on a project, a pop-up came up and read 'traffic rush free to your computer'. So dumb me downloads it and my parents caught me playing. Has this changed your mind? Since you probably haven't changed your mind, here is another thing why computers are bad: your car. All guys love cars. Computers are holding more than forty percent of people back from working on or driving their cars. The only person it hasn't affected is my dad, he works on his cars day in and day out. My grandmom said something interesting to me the other day, ""your dad comes up to visit me more than my other sons, my other sons are crazy for computers."" People go bananas for computers today. Lately, I have seen less and less people outside anymore. There is only one reason for that: all people are shaved in their basement in the dark, so when the light turns on it burns their eyes it's so bright. Come on, did this change your mind yet now? Well, since you are still reading on that means you cannot make up your mind. Well here's this: people are starting to not want to ride their bikes anymore. That is Facebook's fault; this is what they think, ""I can talk now, why do I need to ride to talk in person?"" That is ninety percent right for what they are thinking. Because we took a test of all the kids who have Facebook, and that's what around all of them said. I know, it's amazing. A stay-at-home mother said, ""my son is gaining weight, all he does is eat and go on Facebook. When he's not on during the day, I catch him at night too."" That is a sad story for that mother. I ride my bike a lot; this is a real-life story: once I was sitting around doing nothing really, and my mom said we are riding bikes for ten miles. I got up and did it too. That had to change your mind, or nothing will. So, in conclusion, I have no more ideas against computers and why they are bad. But just remember your grades, your cars, and your weight. So please, change your mind."
137	137	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think computers are good; this is because you can learn things about faraway places using them, you can also hear about the most recent news, and you can communicate with people. In school, a lot of the research projects on other places focus on other places around the world. When you use a computer you can read articles about the place and also get pictures and use them in a slideshow or photo story. There are also educational websites that kids can go on to learn their math facts, from addition to multiplication tables. Clearly, the computer is a good learning tool. The computer can keep you up-to-date with the news too! There are news websites that post minute-to-minute things about world news and tell the world what kind of disaster happened in some faraway place on the other side of the world. A lot of the time, families are spread all over the world; you can chat with family or friends that have moved through a simple chat room and you can catch up on what has been happening in each other's lives, and that's a good tool for family to stay in touch. Therefore, the computer has lots of benefits that a lot of people all around the world can use, from learning about a faraway country to chatting with a cousin that lives in California, and also knowing what's going on in your own hometown. It connects us to information and to each other in ways that were once impossible.
138	138	1	3	"There has been a lot of discussion of whether computers affect people in a positive way or in a negative way. I believe that computers affect most people negatively. I think this because people lose their ""people skills"" by talking through the computer, computers can also lead to danger, and because people tend to forget about their priorities in life. From what I know, most people that use computers use them to talk to friends and other people around the world. Instead of hanging out with their friends, they talk through the computer, and if that is what they do more than hanging in person, then they won't recognize the facial expressions given to them by certain people. While talking in person, you get the full-on experience of communicating with them. You get the tone of voice in addition to the facial expressions. You also get the body language which you can't get from on the computer unless you are using a webcam. Computers have led to many dangers. These dangers affect every user and their families. There have been many cases of young teenagers being tricked by older users into showing them parts of their body or making the teens believe that the older user can relate to their problems and are the same age. Sometimes the teen is persuaded to leave their home and neighborhood to meet the other user. Also, another type of danger is cyberbullying. Cyberbullies lower your self-esteem. The bullies call you names and pick on you and sometimes make you feel suicidal. If we hadn't any computers then none of these dangers would be occurring. With computers, people have lost their judgment in top priorities. Some computer users tend to forget about the important things in life such as family, school work, and their own health. Some people would rather stay on the computer than hang out with family and friends. Others tend to choose not to do their homework and work on their social life on the computer instead. Since they are on the computer a lot, they seem to ignore their health. They don't exercise as much and don't eat as healthy. So in my opinion, life without computers would be good for everyone. People would still have the people skills they had before, there wouldn't be as much danger, and people would focus more on the important things than their online social lives, leading to a healthier and more connected society."
139	139	1	3	Dear Editor, I think computers do have a positive effect on people, but I don't think computers are the reason people don't exercise or enjoy nature. People make their own choices in life. The computer is just there. If somebody chooses to be on the computer instead of spending time with their family, well that's their choice and problem, not the computer's. Me, for example, I love working and playing on the computer. Even though I'm on the computer, I still do things like talk to my family, I play basketball, and I chill with my homies. Now that's my choice to do all of that. I can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time. There is nothing wrong with doing that because that is my choice in life. Nobody should be able to tell you to get off the computer because that is your choice in life. If you want to be on the computer instead of going outside, that's your choice. Only you know what is best for you, and the computer itself is not to blame for how people decide to use their own time and manage their own responsibilities and relationships.
140	140	1	3	Dear editor, I have heard that some experts are saying that teenagers spend too much time online. I thoroughly believe they are mistaken. With the use of the internet, people can learn about faraway places without spending money to go there. Our military uses the internet to talk to their family and friends stateside. Also, it helps us acquire great hand-eye coordination. If someone was planning a trip to Europe, they would check the internet often. Firstly, they would check out sites to go to in Europe. Second, they would check and compare hotels in Europe. Thirdly, they would check the weather in Europe. Finally, they would check airports for flights going to and from Europe. Without the internet, planning vacations would be close to impossible. People not only use the internet for pleasure but for communication purposes too. They use web cams to talk online to people in faraway places. It is a fast, free, and convenient way to communicate with other people. Our military uses web cams to let the soldiers talk to their families. How would you feel if you were a soldier fighting for your country and the means to talk to your family is out there, but you could not use it? It is cruel and unjust to keep soldiers from talking to their families. The internet also gives us something useful. It helps us build hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is used in many things. In basketball, you need to be able to look up and dribble at the same time. When you are driving, you need to be able to look up and still be able to steer the car. Without hand-eye coordination, many more accidents would happen from careless errors. The internet helps people make the world a safer place. In some aspects, the experts are right. We should go out and enjoy nature, but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as well. Some people use it for pleasure and to build hand-eye coordination, while others use it to talk to their loved ones or use it to plan vacations. No matter who you are or what you do, the internet plays an important part in modern life, offering tools for learning, connection, and safety that we should not dismiss.
141	141	1	3	"Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I strongly believe that computers affect us in a positive way. Computers are advancing and so are their uses; they are great tools that do not replace our thought process or our need to run around outside and play sports. Computers help us find and talk to relatives and friends, and they allow us to learn different things about faraway places. They also are great for research! First and foremost, computers are affecting us positively, especially when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted and @NUM1 years ago she really wanted to find her birth family. One year later, her birth father found her on a specialized website where you can locate family members. She found her family, and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have been able to get to know them if it wasn't for the computer. Speaking of communication, I was working like a dog on this big science project I had. We weren't able to meet in person, and it @CAPS3 impossible for one person to coordinate the work of four people. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done successfully. ""@CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!"" @CAPS3 something that @CAPS3 commonly said. Over @PERCENT1 of adults complain that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 never enough time in the day. That @CAPS3 a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi-task, so you can be on your business call and email your mother simultaneously so she knows that you didn't forget her birthday. In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing. @CAPS2 are many people who don't have TVs and they get their news from the internet. Also for projects, in @NUM2 grade I had to learn about @CAPS4, the country in @LOCATION2. It would take countless hours to find research in books, and you will find a lot of stuff you don't need, but on the computer it @CAPS3 fast and easy. If you need to know something, you can just type it in and, boom! You have it, whereas if you were using a book you would still be looking for what you need. Time @CAPS3 something that we can't afford to waste, especially in this economy. Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer, and that exercising is neglected, are not always right. I don't know about you, @PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exercises to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions; finding routes on paper maps are infuriating and take forever. Go on the computer; the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with fingerprints fast so no one else can get hurt. In conclusion, computers affect us in positive ways and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life-changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye in this matter; advancing computers are our friends, not the enemy."
142	142	1	3	"As more and more people are becoming accustomed to using computers, I believe that this is having a negative effect on society. Because of computers, people are not exercising as much as they should, which is of crucial importance for physical health. In addition, people are becoming unable to enjoy and appreciate nature while they still can, missing out on the beauty of the outdoors. Finally, people are slowly losing their ability to communicate genuinely with family and friends. As every day people are getting in touch with technology, they are losing touch with the world around them. Therefore, the advances in technology are having a negative effect on society. When the average person uses the computers, be it for business, homework, chatting, or just for fun, they are easily occupied for long periods of time. They consider themselves ""too busy"" for a thing called exercise, which is becoming more and more crucial to our health and well-being. With music, video, and cool friends right in front of us on the screen, who has time to live? Time to go for a walk, jog, or bike ride? With computers, people are losing the will to exercise. In this day and age, when the environment is becoming more polluted, we need our exercise more than ever. Every day, rainforests are destroyed, air is polluted, and skies are clouded. We need to appreciate nature, but because of computers, we realize it only through an @ORGANIZATION1 screen. We need to wake up and appreciate the real world, not the digital one presented by @ORGANIZATION1. As time goes by, communication technology through the internet is making the issue of building @CAPS1, healthy relationships a progressively worse issue. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" is something that doesn't completely exist on the internet. This means that while you @MONTH1 find someone you can call a ""friend"" online, you never know exactly who they are until you've actually met them...which could be potentially dangerous. Additionally, the very @CAPS1 emotions and human need for interaction that comes with relationships is something that can never be simulated or programmed, no matter how ""advanced"" your technology is. As you can see, the dependency on and average use of computers is having a negative effect on our society. We are not taking the time for exercise and genuine human interaction, all of which are vital to our health. And in a world where it's more important than ever to be healthy, grateful, and diplomatic, we are slowly losing these important qualities. Therefore, computers, as promoted by @ORGANIZATION1, are having a negative effect on society."
143	143	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I am a student in @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. I want to state an opinion on how computers affect people. There are many things like games, chatrooms, and social things online. Also, there is information for homework or for work and jobs. Well, let's get started. @CAPS1 opinion on people using computers is good; only fools don't use computers. They help you a lot; let's say I am a cook and I forgot how to do something, I'll just go on the computer and find it, and it's that easy. I have used a computer all @CAPS1 life and I am smart; I even help @CAPS1 mom use the computer sometimes. Chat rooms are good too; you can make new friends and you can talk to family members, like your mom, dad, or cousin if they live in a different part of the world. I talk to @CAPS1 cousin all the time, not really a little, and he lives in Colombia. I also talk to @CAPS1 friends on Facebook to ask what the homework was sometimes. Games are fun when you get bored or do not have anything to do. You can play all different kinds of games like action games, or if you want a challenge you can play hard games; I think games like chess or Sudoku help your brain think and exercise your brain. Games can help you know the computer more; many people are bored, and many people don't even know how to type without looking at the board. I have to look at it sometimes. Well, these are the same opinions I had about the computer. Even though people think it takes time from exercising and interacting with people, it's not really wasted time. They are exercising their brain and they can interact with people online. So, till next time, I stand by my view that computers are beneficial.
144	144	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are a help to our planet. The new technology makes life easier to handle. Computers are a help because they teach hand-eye coordination. You can talk to people, and it is a new way to be entertained. Computers can teach hand-eye coordination because of typing. Whether someone knows it or not, when you are typing fast it is helping your hands. Also, the fact that you are typing without making many errors is also helping because it makes your hands easier to move. The typing is giving your hands lots of exercise because your hands are moving all over the keyboard. The more you move them, the more exercise you can get. Computers can really help hand-eye coordination a lot. Computers can also help by allowing you to talk to people. To talk to people far away is better on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other. You are able to talk to people from different countries and learn about their cultures. Also, computers are able to be used in business meetings when a company has to talk with another from different locations. Like if part of the business is doing a project in Hong Kong, then the boss can set up a video meeting to see how it is going. Another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person. Like if a person is in the hospital but you're not able to go, then you can talk while seeing each other through the computer. Computers are a great way to use in communication. Computers are also a new way to get entertained. They can entertain you because there are games that you can play. There are games that come with the computers and a lot of games on the internet. Instead of being bored all the time, you can play thousands of games with just a click on a mouse. Also, to not be bored you can watch videos like on YouTube. You can listen to music or watch comedy videos. Videos also show a way to express what you feel and say it through comedy, horror, or sad videos. Also for teenagers, there are ways to talk to their friends like on Facebook. On the website you can chat with anyone on your friends list. In the end, computers can help kids, adults, or teenagers. With just a click of your mouse you can find a new powerful way of technology and be able to get better hand-eye coordination, talk to people, and get entertained. So go get yourself a computer and be amazed by its capabilities!
145	145	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 are you administering your local newspaper to society? You are probably using a computer to type the documents. If the government, businesses, schools, students and local newspapers are using computers for a variety of different tasks, then @CAPS1 are they not helpful? Primarily, computers are used for typing, editing and presenting; as stated before, local newspapers are required to use computers to present their work. As a member of society, I know I would not want to read something not typed anyway. The government must announce laws to the people and use typed documents to communicate with different countries & states. Without computers, signs, flyers, businesses, and even newspapers would not be possible in their current form. You are running late to work because of traffic on the highway. @CAPS1 are you supposed to explain to your boss in time? You can simply email him the situation and arrive stress-free to work. Practically the entire world uses computers as a source of communication, so why be indifferent? Computers make life easier for people through communication like email, social network websites such as Facebook and AOL, and even video chat. Computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools. Teachers and administrators interact with each other with important messages using computers. If computers are important to them, then @CAPS1 could they be destructive to society? As a Western Middle School student, I know the amount of projects and research we are required to do per class. Without the internet this would almost be impossible. The internet allows research to happen efficiently. After research is finished, the paper or homework assignment must be typed and printed. Without the assistance from computers, having neatly-written and well-researched assignments would not be possible. To conclude, I feel that computers are an excellent advance in technology and should be used as frequently as possible. Without them, newspapers could not print, teachers could not communicate effectively, and students couldn't complete tasks for school. As a student I know they help me with schoolwork and communicating with my friends and relatives. If computers are such a helpful source to society, why would people consider them as a concern? They are clearly a positive force.
146	146	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that using computers helps people because if we did not have computers we would not know anything about anyone or anything. For instance, I would not know anything about all of the @CAPS1, but with computers I know a lot about them and their lives. For example, I learned that @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 were important figures, and that @CAPS4 got shot in the back of the head. I also know that @CAPS4 got shot too, and I know a lot about the @ORGANIZATION1, who were white people that instilled fear in black people. The same goes for learning about wars like World War @NUM1 and World War @NUM2, and the @CAPS5 conflict. I read about @PERSON1 and the @CAPS6 war, where a plane was spying, flying across @LOCATION1, and it was shot down because people were trying to see if they had any nuclear bombs over there. And the same applies to Google and Yahoo; with Google you can type in anything and you will get an answer, and most likely a correct one. Yahoo and Google are great for schoolwork, products, and studying because then you can accomplish your tasks. For all these reasons, I think that computers are good for learning and understanding the world around us.
147	147	1	3	Hour after hour of gaming online and posting blogs on social networking sites is all one sees. Unaware of their surroundings, many people zone into their computer screens and only break away when it is absolutely necessary. That is not what the world should become, but that is what our society is creating. Computers do not create positive benefits for society. Because of all the time spent on the computer, people's bodies are taking the negative effects. There is also less and less face-to-face interaction with family and friends. Another huge issue is cyberbullying. These are all problems that should be addressed. With all the time spent on a computer in a stuffy, dark room, how will our bodies be maintained properly? Exercise is a key ingredient to healthy living. It is like trying to make bread without flour; without that necessity, the bread will not rise to its full potential. It is the same with the health and functions of our bodies. Exercise must be taken part in to burn fat and calories, but it is also needed to build and maintain muscles. In fact, it is recommended to get in at least one hour of exercise or outside play a day. Not many succeed with this goal, which brings up another negative effect on the body. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 helps to maintain strong bones. To get the recommended dose of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 a day, you only need to absorb @NUM1 minutes of sunlight. It doesn't seem like a lot, but @PERCENT1 of our population is not outside to receive it. Instead, they are inside on their computers. Parties, lunch breaks, or even a family dinner are great times to socialize. But, what if one day you decided you were going to skip your lunch break with friends and instead spend time posting a daily blog? This is social time lost. If this habit continues, you might soon see yourself drifting away from your friends because you don't make the time to spend your lunch break with them. Even @CAPS4, a child's interactions @CAPS4 chatting with friends on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6, can be problematic because anything could be said. Children won't learn at a young age how to think on their feet or use factual language. This will affect their later years @CAPS4 when interviewing for things such as colleges or even jobs. Social skills are the difference between success and failure. Spending life on a computer is equivalent to being a caterpillar in its cocoon, while at least attempting to be social will help you develop. @CAPS7 and @CAPS7 are all created with the ominous threat of cyberbullying. One simple way to prevent this is by spending less time on the computer. The effects of cyberbullying can be brutal. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be bullied in person than over the internet. The reason is that a special cruelty is displayed through cyberbullying because it takes much less courage to type something than for a bully to say something to their victim's face. Such cyberbullying has even led to suicides. In fact, a girl committed suicide due to cyberbullying just @NUM2 weeks ago. In conclusion, computers produce more negative effects on society than good. A lack of exercise and proper body maintenance results. Reduced social interaction and skills also result. And maybe most importantly, cyberbullying, which takes lives, occurs. To prevent society from turning into a social wasteland filled with the glow of computer screens, let's all turn off the monitor and get outside with nature and all its benefits.
148	148	1	3	I believe that computers benefit our society for many reasons. Computers have been around for many years now, and everywhere you go you usually see one. That must mean people love them. There are so many uses and fun experiences you can have with a computer. Computers make people happy, and that makes for a better society because it is happier. They make people happy because you can play games like Tetris, @CAPS1, and even cards. Computer games make people happy because whenever they are bored and there is nothing going on, you can hop on the computer and play a game. Some of the awesome games featured on a computer are @CAPS1, cards, pinball, and other great games. The computer makes for a happier home because as soon as kids get home from school they use it for games or to chat with friends. Another reason computers benefit society is because you can now pay bills and buy things from the internet. When you pay bills or buy things over the internet, there is no need to go out and waste money on gas, so it makes people very happy when they save money. It also saves on pollution because if a car isn't going out, there is less of it, so computers are also saving society as well. My last reason that computers benefit society is they can make you smarter and help you do better in school by learning about other people or cultures. For example, on my last research project for social studies I used the computer and got an A; this made me happy, so in effect it makes society happy. Now you have my reasons why computers benefit society. They make us happy, make us smarter, and make us a better society for it. I love computers and everybody else should too because of the joy and knowledge they bring into our lives.
149	149	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I am stating my opinion that the more people use computers, the less time they spend with their family. I have three reasons why computers are good or bad. Not everyone agrees that computers are beneficial for society, considering the positive and negative effects they have on people. My first reason for supporting this @CAPS1 that computers are good or bad is that computers have a positive effect on people. The second @CAPS1 is the ability to talk to other people online. The last @CAPS1 I have is that we should spend more time with family than on the computer. The first reason that I have for computers is how they have a positive effect on people. The examples that I have to support this @CAPS1 are that computers teach hand-eye coordination and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. The second reason that I have about computers is that you can talk to people online. The examples that I have to support my @CAPS1 are the websites that kids use to talk to their friends, like Myspace and Facebook. The places that kids like to go to are YouTube and even blogging about everything and everyone. Some of these things can be good if you don't post pictures or other items on your Myspace or Facebook. I think that these websites are dangerous because somebody can hack into your files and they can try to talk to you like they are your friend. The third reason I have to support my @CAPS1 is that we should spend more time with our family than being on the computer the whole time. I have examples of what we should do with our families instead of being on the computers. I have some @CAPS1 of games that we can play with our families instead of being on the computers. The games that we can play with our families are Monopoly, Sorry, Candy Land, cards, and video games. We can also talk to our family instead of talking to our friends the whole time. We should enjoy what we have in life, not just with computers but with our family. In conclusion, I am stating my opinion that the more time people spend on computers, the less time they spend with their own family. I have three reasons on why computers are good or bad. The reasons that I have to support my @CAPS1 are that computers have a positive effect on people, they allow you to talk to people online, but we must remember to spend more time with family than on the computer.
150	150	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 computers do have some cons, but they also have a lot of pros. Some pros are they show magnificent pictures of nature, and you can keep these pictures until you want to send them by email. You can even order tickets for planes, trains, and movies. Let's not forget shopping and the internet. If you go on the internet you can find many pictures of anything you want, such as pictures of nature or celebrities. About @PERCENT1 of all pictures on the internet are true. A computer can also hold pictures that you take on a digital camera. It can even take a project on a flash drive and then download it. The computer can even email the pictures to any email that exists. If you want to go to the movies or on vacation, you can get the movie tickets online through any ticket sales website. If you want to go on vacation you can get your hotel tickets, and even your plane, train, or boat ticket online. Buying tickets isn't the only thing you can do on the internet; you can buy stuff too. You can order @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2, GameCube, Xbox, Xbox @NUM3, Wii, and even computer games. You can even buy the game systems themselves. You can buy household appliances and put clothes and other store products on hold. On the internet you can watch videos on almost any website you go on. Some @MONTH1 be of grass, some @MONTH1 be funny, and others @MONTH1 even be weird. @PERCENT2 of all teenagers like watching music videos; some are just the artist singing and dancing in a background, while other times people make fun of other artists. Even though computers do have pros and cons, they have more pros, as shown by the examples in the passage above, making them a valuable tool for entertainment and convenience.
151	151	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I don’t agree with the people who say people spend too much time on their computers. Because people can learn mostly anything they want all on a computer; also, there are lots of reasons why people should use advanced technology. They can teach kids how to find out answers to their homework the fast way instead of reading a book or taking a class and still get the full understanding. The people that say others spend too much time on their computers are also right about that, but they still can interact with friends and family; they can play games, speak to each other, even learn new things together, all through a computer. One thing they were right about was to go out and enjoy the nature; you can't do that on a computer, but you can help nature on a computer, like try to put up a blog. Something that people make so others can see and spread the word, and on that blog, it can say stop cutting down trees for stores or stop killing animals for their fur or anything you want to write. So the people that do read this, you should agree with me because you can do lots of things on a computer and learn a lot more than you ever thought you could. So go out and find you a computer and find something you need to do or learn or just to have some fun, and you will see the benefits for yourself.
152	152	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is a positive effect. Three main reasons are that people learn more about cultures, places, and some people work online. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about cultures around the world. Learning about cultures is very important because if people travel they need to know how they can respect each other and understand different traditions. My second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world. Learning about places is very important because you could get lost; it also helps you by telling you which places are famous to visit and how to navigate them safely. My third reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because some people find jobs online; other people work online, which benefits people in a positive way by offering new opportunities. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they help people learn about cultures, places, and jobs around them, making the world more connected and accessible for everyone.
153	153	1	3	To the Editor, there are many people in this world that think always being on the computer is good because they can talk with people online and learn more about the world. But, then there are people who disagree with them. I am one of those people. Spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life. People stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. So, I hope that while you read through this letter, you take some of this information into consideration. First of all, when people spend a lot of time on the computer they aren't getting all of the exercise that their body needs. They become lazy and don't want to do anything. This is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. People might become overweight and since they got lazy from always being on the computer, they won't go out and get the exercise that their body needs. People need to enjoy their life! By always being on the computer, they won't be able to. There are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body. You can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. Many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. But, some of their family and friends are too lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer. Instead, they stay inside the house all cooped up and don't get enough fresh air. This is a horrible thing to do to yourself. Your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! Finally, people might lose contact with family members or their friends because they are too busy on the computer playing games. I know I wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and I don't think anyone else would want to either. I once lost a friend or two because I didn't talk to them as much as I used to because I had been too busy on the computer on social media, various websites, and games. I felt horrible because I didn't realize that I had been doing that. I really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. Its horrible and you don't feel like yourself anymore. Once again I would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. You can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and might lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend too much time on the computer. I hope that after reading this, you realize that being on the computer is not always good for you and that balance is key to a healthy and happy life.
154	154	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. It helps people learn new things about different cultures. Also, it lets you communicate with friends and family through the internet, for example, using facebook or other platforms. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. For example, here, we learn about various countries and their histories. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. However, some people don't have the chance to get this kind of education, so they turn to the internet. If the computer didn't exist, we might not know about the lifestyle thousands of miles away from us. We wouldn't know if their lifestyles are extremely difficult or luxurious. Also, we wouldn't know if we could help them or not. For example, the earthquake in a distant country which we learned about online. It's one step closer to world peace, no more war or conflicts. Secondly, the computer helps you communicate to friends and family all over the world. I remember one time I was mailing my family friend who was in another country, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. I don't know how I would have managed without the internet. Other ways you could live are also possible through just communicating with friends on internet sites, which is extremely useful. Finally, you use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever there is a research task, the internet is there. This is extremely reliable and accurate. However, some of the websites are fake, which is why it is important to find great research to use for school projects. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their assignments on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my history teacher, for instance, would have links on her page to help us study. Also, there is another website that helps us study for vocab. It also has many games that help us learn our vocab words. As you can see, the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. As a very successful newspaper and for people, I assume you will understand how much the computer has made a positive effect in society and will continue to do so.
155	155	1	3	"Dear School Board, recently there has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society. Some ""experts"" say computers are good for society and some think the opposite computers are bad for society because they make children obese, decrease a person social skills, and even make children less educated. Computers are just plain bad. In recent years studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active. Dr. Smith says, ""The more children use computers is the more time they waste sitting and not being active at all."" A study conducted by the Health Department shows that children that use the computer several hours a day are more obese then children who use it one hour or less a day. Computers keep children inside all day. A child on the computer is wasting time not being active. The main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy. Computer are a direct cause to child obesity, and they are a threat to society. Some of you might think a computer can increase social skills, and you are dead wrong! On a computer you can ""talk"" to friends, but it is not like you are actually talking to them. On a computer you can talk in private and say what ever the heck you want. In public if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble. A computer offers no face to face interaction. So when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward. My cousin spends all of his time on the computer and when I went to his house on christmas he never took his eyes off the screen! Computers is destroying the social life millions of people. Did you know that people who use the computer often are usually less smart than kids who don't? ""Experts"" on computers say that computers can be used for infinite knowledge. The key word in that phrase is ""can"". just because kids have knowledge at their finger tips doesn't mean the will use it. On many projects and homework assignments I have recorded kids say ""why bother, I just copied and printed an article on google."" By copying and printing students don't learn anything. Computers are slowly making people less educated. Ever since the invention of the computer people have seen promise for society. Now computers are destroying society by making people fat, socially weird, and less educated. So how can people still think computers are good when the evidence points so clearly to the contrary?"
156	156	1	3	"Dear Local newspaper, I just read about your article regarding the computer usage. In my opinion I think that computers are a good thing. Yet, I believe that it could have a negative influence as well. I believe that computers are one of mankind's best technologies. You can type documents, learn about historical happenings, explore different places, and discover different cultures as well. You can talk to people from far away by using chat applications or the webcam. That's what I use to speak to my grandparents who live in another state. Computers are one of the best things that has happened to me and my life. However, although computer can be such a good thing, it can be bad as well. A lot of people over used it too. I infact know a person and she's a very nice person. She's sweet, caring, loves kids, and has a kind heart. The only thing is, is that she's a social media addict. She loves social media. Sometime when she comes over, I'll be using my laptop and she'll ask to check her social media status. My point is, is that she allows social media to take over her life, which is not cool. I read an article the other day about computer usage in our country. Dr. Jane Smith covered this article on the topic of computer usage. She said ""The average american spends four hours or more on the computer. Although there are other people who spend their time outside when it's nice. I congradulate them on that"". See, now you heard it from the expert as well. In cocnclusion, I would like to state that computers can have either a positive influence or a negative one as well. So it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it. So my point that I would to come across to our community is that use you computer wisely. Don't spend all of your time on it. Life's too short for that. So spend time with family and friends and go outside too!"
157	157	1	3	"Dear Editor, How much time do you spend on the computer daily, one hour, two hours? While computers are amazing advances in technology they are also very bad for you. People spend hours at a time on the computer causing less time exercising, horrible speaking skills, and dangerous searches. From 1990 to 2010 the numbers of obese people increased from 15 percent of American citizens to 30 percent. In a recent study the amount of families with computers is now 8 out of 10 compared to the 2 out of 10 in 1985. Scientist wonder if they were connected and relized they were. People who spent hours on the computer live a sedentary life style. They are more likly to go on the computer than go exercise. The lack of exercising causes obeseity, and cardovascular problems. Without this valuable exercise more people are developing serious health issues. At a visit to the hospitial a surgen said he has seen a huge increase of heart surgreys in the last decade. We found that the computer manual booklets says to only go on for an hour at a time. The hottest thing online these days is social networking, whether it's Twitter, or Facebook. These social networking sites allow teens to talk with there friends. But this really isn't talking. For example they write ""im going 2 dance"". Not only is the spelling wrong but also the grammer. And this language doesnt just stay online, it is now how they talk. Mrs. Jones the grandmother to a social networking teen said, ""I can't even have conversations with her because she is is talking like she is on the computer. It's so sad."" As for public speaking and english class, Mrs. Smith an english teacher for twenty years states that she has seen a drop in teens ability to write gramaticly correct and that when she corrects essay the are written is social networking form. ""It's hard to see litiature dissolving because kid are spending so much time on the computer. The average day for children in our town is to go home and going on the computer for hours at a time until a parent comes home. Would you like your child to be surfing the internent alone without you for hours when you don't know what they are doing. Parent blockers can only do so much. Children can find out the password and navigate around them. The dangers are always there. You can get a lot of good information on the internet but you can also get a lot of bad information. You dont know what your child is searching or who they are talking to on the computer, it could be ""a friend,"" or the predator who lives four blocks over."
158	158	1	3	Dear newspaper, While some beleive computers do not benefil society, I do. Computers help buisnesses thrive, keep people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. Computers greatly benefit small and large buisnesses across the world. Imagine all the jobs at each buisnesses without a computer. Buisnesses would be unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. Any buisness owner would cringe at the idea of running a buisness without a computer. When surveyed, 9 out of 10 buisness owners and workers would prefer a computers assistance at work. Almost every modern day buisness relies on at least one computer. For example, companies that mass-produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker. Sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. Buisness also need computers to quickly recieve and send information to other buisnesses and people. Buisnesses are not the only need for computers. People use computers as much if not more, than buisnesses. People like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know. Thanks to websites like Facebook and e-mail people can easily stay in touch. Families use computers to plan get-togethers and share photos. Friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. With computers, anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. People also like to know news imediately. Without computers it would be alot harder to contact the rest of the world. Imagine a natural disaster accuring and not knowing about it right away. In that case we could not send aid to the area. With the recent earthquakes in Haiti and Japan, knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. Newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late and they often use computers to aquire that information. Eighty-seven percent of scientists agree that recieving information would be a lot harder without this technology.
159	159	1	3	"Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are taking over the humans. Humans especially children, need exercise. But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. Thirteen year olds are making facebooks! You can find ten year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on social media, and their ""friends"" lie to them, about their age, or another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, farm games, and YouTube, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it all day, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to cut back four or five hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. Computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop it from dominating our lives."
160	160	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff. For example, they don't spend time exercising, enjoying nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Those are very important things that people don't undeRstand that they are missing out on. First, people that spend a lot of time on the computer don't do exercise. Doing exercise is good for your health. If you don't do exercise when you get older your bones are going to be weak. Also, you could get fat and that is bad for your heart. Just for being on the computer people don't pay attention to their health. Next, people don't enjoy the beautiful nature that is outside. It is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside. People are forgeting about nature. They don't recycle so the planet could be clean. The air that we smell is not clean because they don't care about nature. Instead of being on the computer they chould help so the world could be better. Finally, people don't spend time with the people that love them. It is very important to spend time with your family. People don't realize that the first thing in life is your family. Instead of being on the computer, is fun going to the beach with your kids, wife, father, and etc. In conclusion, i believe that computers affect people negatively. People just for being on the computer they don't do exercise, enjoy nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Now that you heard my opinion, i ask you to think about your own habits and make a positive change.
161	161	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a very positive effect on people. I agree that computers have a positive effect. They teach hand-eye coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about people and places, and you can talk online. The first reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. For example, when you learn how to type, you can memorize the keys. Therefore, you don't have to look down at the keyboard, which improves your coordination between seeing the screen and using your hands. Computers also teach hand-eye when using a mouse. When you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon. The final reason that computers teach hand eye is once you know what to do, you don't have to search the screen for an icon. You could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and know what to do. Computers teach hand-eye coordination when you type, when you move the mouse to click on an icon, and when you memorize all of the icons. The second reason is computers make you smarter. For example, if you have a history project, and you need to know about china, you can use the computer. How many times would china be in the newspaper? Using the computer can access quick information, providing facts and figures instantly. Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew about. You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds. The last example is that a search engine can look up famous pictures. If you are working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can have the photos you need. Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries, you could look up people, and famous countries. The last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends, for example, you could catch up with friends you don't see that much during school. Talking online is just as fast as texting. Also, you could continue a conversation you had with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, you can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, you can just plain talk. You could make plans, or you can talk about upcoming events. Computers give you access to talking with your friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on other people. You can get hand-eye coordination, you can look up foreign countries and people, and you can talk with your friends.
162	162	1	3	"Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place. People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows are available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. However, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly what society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition, you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease! Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it! The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and family easier as well! Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want! Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing for everyone."
163	163	1	3	Computers are over used and controll the minds some people. Computers are parcally to @CAPS1 for americas high obesity percentage. Americas teens are not doing homework. And noteveteing time into school because of computers. These high tech machines should be outlowed and given to only those who truly need them. People spend way to much time on computers. The time people spend on the computer is time they should be exersizing. Computers make people obees studys show that @PERCENT1 of obees americans admit to being adicted to the computer. This is why computers are bad. The internet on computers is unsafe. Expers say that popular chating sites such as myspace are the reason for the sudden incroas in murders, and rapings. The number of convicted criminals as well as sex affenders i tramendus. Yet parents lot the children on them. People don't understand the troubles computers cause. Besides the other factors computers retard teens learning. Teh comkputer is suposed to be a helpful tool and used for leanring. But computers are being used for other things. Computers encourage kids not to study or do homework. Although those are useful becoming sites and tools, these tool arent used often. Computers hurt people in many ways. America should have off computer week to fight back from its evil grie on children. I hope one day we can all turn off out computers for good and live healthier lives.
164	164	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? I personally think computers have a positive effect on people because with computers many people @CAPS1 research about the past. Also I don't agree that computers have a negative effect on anybody because with computers many people learn hand-eye coordinations, gives them the ability to learn about faraway people and places, they also allow people to talk to old friends or family members. Then, computers can also be used to help someone find information about nature such as different trees, plants, animals, and many other things that are involved in nature. After that, computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live faraway from you. Some ways to contact people on a computer are using e-mails, instant message, facebook, myspace, and many other websites. In addition, I think computers have a positive effect on people, but others maya not agree which is fine because not everybody has the same opinion on stuff in the world. Then, computers can be very useful to many people because they can use computers if they need to find information on history, any events that might have went on in the past that might not still be done in the present. Finally, computers are useful to scientists, business workers, many adults, and even children use computers if they need to type something for school or need to find information for a project they're doing for their classes.
165	165	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, everday @CAPS1 technology is developed. One of the biggest and most popular machines in the technocle society is, the computer. Some people don't like computers. The think computers are ruining social skills and healthy bodys. The reason I'm writing to you is to presuade those people to realize the greatness that lies inside a computer. For starters computers help us recive/give @CAPS8. One of the great featurs that computers give is email. Without email, we would be completley out of the loop. For example @CAPS2 there is a snowday at your childs school, you recive an email from the usper intendent saying school si cancled. Without that email, we woulden't be able to know that @CAPS8. Another example, @CAPS6 say that you lost your voice to a terrible cold. You don't feel good and need to call work to report being sick. Now you're stuck because you have no voice. @CAPS2 you had a computer, you could have simply emailed your boss. Another posative tool computers gives us is making communicating esayer. With all of the social networking now avalible like @CAPS4, twitter , @CAPS3 and yahoo messanger. It nearly impossible not to stay in contact with friends and faimly using @CAPS4, you can look up old friends and faimly. Once youve found them, you can friend request them and become online friends. Once youre online friends you can instant message, video chat, look at their status, and browse their photos. So with a computer @CAPS7 nearly impossible not to be able to keep in touch. The last and final reason computers are great is because, they make shopping much esayer. @CAPS2 you have used amazon, ebay or overstock, you know what I'm talking about you can buy almost anything online. From electronics to @CAPS5 animals. The list is endless. With a computer you can even get your house hold groceries online. For example @CAPS6 say your home from work with explosive diharrea. But @CAPS7 @DATE1 so you need to go grociery shopping. You've been on the toilet @PERCENT1 of the day and alls youve got is your laptop. Well you can shop online. So as you can see computers help us communicate, shop and get and recive @CAPS8 efficiently.
166	166	1	3	"To the editor, It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and a lazy breeze is flowing through the trees. But you don't notice any of it because you're plopped down in front of your computer tapping away on instant messages or email. With modern technology, this is a common scenario. Experts are concerned that excessive computer use can harm your health, hamper your social skills, and cause you to be disconnected from nature. While computers are helpful in our lives, too much of one thing is never a good thing. As mentioned, computers can have a negative effect on your health. Computers cause people to be lazy. They would rather send instant messages and email than go outside and exercise in the cool, crisp, fresh air. In fact, statistics recently released by the National Health Institute show that computers are the number one leading reason for obesity. And weight problems are not the only thing computer users have to worry about. Too much time in front of the computer will also take its toll on your eyes. Even local doctors have pointed this out. ""Ever since computers have become a common household item, the number of children I have seen with eye strain has gone up about twenty or thirty more kids every year than the year before,"" says Dr. Evans of the City Medical Association. And if that isn't enough, typing too many text messages and emails day after day can give you repetitive stress syndrome, also known as carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel used to be more common when typewriters were big, but dwindled down once computers with newer, easier to type on keyboards came around. But excessive daily use of computers is causing doctors to see more cases of carpal tunnel crop up. It is clear that if you want to stay healthy, computer usage should be limited. Secondly, too much time spent on the computer can negatively affect your ability to communicate with others. Computers are helpful when you need to talk to someone far away, but people have gotten so used to it that they sometimes find it awkward to talk to someone face to face. Their eyes look everywhere except for the person, they shift their weight back and forth and struggle to find the right words to say things that should be easy. This awkwardness can also ruin previously close friendships. Friends will talk to each other endlessly through messaging, but have no words for each other when they meet face to face. I remember last summer, I didn't see one of my friends at all; we just messaged each other daily. When we saw each other at school, we found it hard to carry a conversation and it took some getting used to talking face to face again. And this isn't the only way friendships are put on the line by computers. Personal and meaningful conversations can sometimes be interrupted. You're on the phone with your friend and you're telling her about something important that you need advice on. A few seconds after you begin talking you're interrupted by a loud notification sound! followed by a ""hold on, so and so just messaged me."" Clearly, computers can seriously harm social skills and personal relationships. Another reason to watch how much time you spend on the computer is that it can cause you to become disconnected from the natural world outside your window, missing the simple joys of a beautiful day."
167	167	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are being questioned if they are good for our society or not. I would have to say that they are good and bad; you really can't pick a side. They are good because children and teens can get the information they need for projects taught in school, it allows people to chat with others in different places, and it helps hand-eye coordination. Those were the good things; here are some bad things about computers. People spend too much time on the computer instead of exercising, they don't get to enjoy nature, and people stop interacting with friends and family. Anyone can pick a side. I just can't, because I can relate to both sides. For example, one of the good reasons about computers was that you can chat with other people around the world. I can relate to that because when I live here in Springfield, Illinois, my mom and stepdad live in Orlando, Florida, so I don't see them much but thanks to the computer I can chat with them whenever I want to. Honestly, I wouldn't know how my life would be like if I didn't have a computer and I wasn't able to connect with them now. Although, I can also relate to one of the bad things about computers, which is that people spend too much time on them. I can relate to that and so could a lot of other people as well, because when I get home around four o'clock because I go to an after-school program, I go straight on my laptop and stay on until around six. When my grandma gets home at seven pm, she always comes in and says, ""You're on that thing too much, you'll ruin your hands!"" in her concerned voice. So in my opinion, I believe that computers can be good for our society and bad; for me there is no single side to take. Others might feel the same way, and others might not. It's up to them to make a choice, so ask yourself, ""Do you believe that computers are good or bad for our society?"""
168	168	1	3	Dear City Newspaper: Have you really thought about how good computers are? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful; they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many educational opportunities. Hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information; with Google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school, surveys show that ninety percent of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and assignments. With computers you can view many different websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use. This is one way computers are a great thing, but there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the whole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than seventy percent of people email, message, or video chat on a daily basis. Isn't it great when you make a great friend in college but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer? Did you know that many people in the military use video chat to keep in touch with their loved ones back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together physically, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers offer many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parents, more than in any other time according to the National Census Bureau, and the number is still drastically increasing. With this economy, some of those parents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their families, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online college courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted. With Craigslist and other online ads, many people can post job offerings while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job. By seeing ads posted online, people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great opportunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take for granted; they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many educational opportunities. So City Newspaper, I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great.
169	169	1	3	Dear City Times, after reading your article about advances in technology, I would like to offer my opinion about this controversial subject. All around the world, people are using computers to do all sorts of things; whether it's for games, the buying and selling of items, or talking with people in different countries; the possibilities are endless. This is, however, not necessarily a good thing. Many people become addicted to computers. Especially adolescents, who enjoy the games that computers offer. From personal experience being addicted to computers, I can honestly say that I was under almost complete control by that computer. My grades started to go down, I stopped interacting with my friends and family, and I had trouble focusing on things. Many parents watch their children go through this and are sometimes helpless to stop it. This poses a large problem for parents who worry about their child's well-being and future. My word of advice; don't let your children become addicted to their screens, as it can truly take over their lives.
170	170	1	3	There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also, it always gives you information every time you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes, meaning not every time you need information the computer will give you the right answer. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others that do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have a lot more fun advantages. One of the most common and used things around the world is instant messaging. Instant messaging is when you are communicating with another human being over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family member or a friend. There are some names for instant messaging like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Email, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people, I agree that they stay on the computer too much and become very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you to stop exercising and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day, maybe more, but too long is not good. There are so many things you can do on the computer I can't name them all: gaming, social media, educational programs, shopping, and even buying things off the computer; those are many of the activities you can do on your computer. I love going on the computer from time to time doing many things I have talked about. Also, if you do not have one, then reading this might persuade you into getting one. My opinion is that they give you a very positive effect on your life when used in a balanced and mindful way.
171	171	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, My opinion on the effects of computers is that some people are spending too much time on them. They are good to be on for a while but not all day. So my first reason why I think spending too much time on computers is not a good thing is because it's better to be outside doing other activities with other people. Instead of being on the computer, you could hang out with friends and do some sports or something else, and if you're on the computer all day you will start to lose some friends. My second reason why I don't think it is good to be on the computer all day is because if you're not exercising you will start to gain weight, since you are sitting all day just on the computer. So it's good to go outside and go for a walk or you could go to a gym so you could do exercise, which is good for you and will keep you healthy. I know someone who is on the computer all day and he really does not go outside because he says that computers teach you a lot, and they do, but it is not good to be on it all day. My last reason on some bad effects of computers is that some people could use these computers for bad things. They could be going on some bad websites and that will just make you be on the computer even longer; you could even become addicted to being on computers because you're doing nothing else. And some people have cameras on their computers and some people use them for some bad things, so that's why it is better not to be on a computer all day long. So these were my reasons for some bad effects computers could have on people if you don't go outside to do some activities or to hang out with some friends, which is ultimately better for your health and social life.
172	172	1	3	Dear Local Community Leaders, I do agree that people should stop spending most of their day on the computer and start to exercise more or spend time with friends and family. The computer has the ability to let you learn about faraway places, but instead of sitting behind a desk and learning about somewhere faraway, you should go outside and see it for yourself. Also, our country is one of the top nations that has overweight people, and I believe that the computer has something to do with this because most of the kids in our school have a Facebook account and about a significant percentage of those kids are on Facebook for at least an hour. This is why people should stop using the internet for most of their day; they are not getting the exercise they need, which is why our country is one of the top in the world that has most overweight people. The internet does allow you to chat with family and friends, but you still need to hang out with your friends outside so you can exercise by playing sports or just going for a walk down the block. If you don't, you will not have a healthy relationship because sometimes they might not even be on the computer for you to chat with them online. Also, if you don't go outside and enjoy nature and play with friends then you will become very lazy just by sitting in a chair all day and you wouldn't care to do anything anymore, which is detrimental to your overall well-being.
173	173	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I would like to tell you about computers; without them this world would fall apart. For example, some people's jobs are to fix them, make them, and sell them. Also, some people work from home and need the computer for their jobs. Without them, so many people would be out of jobs and getting paid less. Also, kids need them for education reasons; for example, if you had a broken finger and couldn't hold a pencil, you would have to type. In addition, what if a student needed an answer to a question and there was no one to help them? They could go online and get the answer and learn. There are many ways a computer can help a person; for example, they could need directions or someone's phone number or answers. Also, you can buy things online; what if you live too far away from your favorite store? You can fast order it offline. Also, I believe kids should get off the computer and go outside and exercise. Today there are too many overweight people; if people went for a walk instead of sitting on the computer all day, there wouldn't be as many overweight people. In addition, people need exercise; without it people would get fat, lazy, sleepy, and some sick, and angry, with depression. It would be to everyone's benefit if people would exercise more. In addition, without computers a lot of people's lives would fall apart, but people just need to exercise more and everything will be fine, creating a healthier balance.
174	174	1	3	Computers are mind-blowing in what they can do. They can make or break someone financially. They also can produce amazing graphics that artists can't produce. Computers are also great for recreational activities, and they also can take your life away. I'm not talking about a real life, I'm talking about the activities you do away from home. Now let's see the benefits and problems; we have come so far on how we handle money. We used to put it in chests and hide them; now all we do is click and type in a security number. People can also invest in items, but investing is tricky; you don't always win. You can win small or lose big. They say modern computers today are advanced. The screens are made of a liquid crystal formula that hardens. The lights in the back pixels do most of the work to bring stunning graphics to life. On computers today, people make money by selling graphics they made on computers. So this would be another plus on what a computer does for a human. I went to a school to learn how to produce great graphics. All teens, kids, and adults have used a computer for recreational activities. On today's computers you can play games, watch videos, and listen to music. People do this to enjoy themselves. Some people can get in trouble for fooling around on the web, but there is nothing wrong with being stressed out and just playing some games for a while. Personally, I like to go on YouTube and find funny videos after school. I used to own a YouTube account and get many views. The worst thing about computers is they can ruin plans or someone's social life; some people get addicted and can't stop being on the computer until it is taken away. For example, some people play World of Warcraft, get addicted, and can't stop! I had a problem when I had to check YouTube a lot. Well, I hope you readers understand. No matter what happens, I think computers benefit us more than the problems they cause.
175	175	1	3	Dear Editorial Board, Computers are a sought-after item in this day and age, and we are making advances in technology every single day. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter are all over the internet. Computers are good to some extent, but some kids find the computer essential to their life. Using computers too much will have a bad effect on society. Snacks like Oreos, and other common treats are sparks for people to be eating while on the computer. Now when you're sitting on the computer daily and for hours eating these snacks, you are begging to become overweight. A significant percentage of children are overweight and that is unhealthy. A colossal piece of this percentage use the computer daily. There is no doubt obesity is a problem, and computers are making it worse. The people that love to use the computer definitely have some sort of social network account, whether it be Twitter, or Facebook. Kids think they are immune to getting in trouble while posting messages or putting up pictures of themselves. In one case a girl was actually killed because of nasty messages posted about her. There have been other cases in which girls have sent nude pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and other people saw it. Their lives will never be the same because they were using the computer too much. Soon we will become the leaders of our communities and we will get to make the decisions. If we are not getting to know our outside world and we are not learning how to be social without the internet, who knows how we will end up. We will be the ones in charge and all that important stuff. Instead of typing away we should explore the world and learn important things. Hopefully, as a society, we will become less dependent on computers and we will fix this problem by spending less time on them. Computers are a great thing but they should not be a substitute for going outside with friends and playing baseball, which is vital for a balanced life.
176	176	1	3	Computers and the internet were a technological breakthrough. It exposed to the average world, things that were never thought possible. But as these things advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so bad it's begun to threaten people's lives. I've been given a choice to side with the addicting computers, or to oppose them. The only clear choice is to oppose them. First off, computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise. Studies show a significant number of people who use a computer do not exercise regularly. With less exercise throughout the world, nations are becoming more over weight. This is a huge problem in the United States; computers are a main cause for why the population is over weight and unhealthy. By cutting down computer use, we can get our world back into great shape and bring exercise and health back. Nextly, I'm sure you've all heard of online predators. It's scary just to think about, and as computer technology increased, online predators' numbers went up. I remember a couple of years ago, I was watching the news and a story came on about a normal teenage girl being killed by someone she met on Myspace. Tragic things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen is increasing. By putting people on computers you're putting them at risk of death; this is an extreme problem computers have caused. This is the last effect computers have, out of many, that I'm going to state: time on the computer is time taken away from family and friends. This can ruin relationships in and outside the family. I'm sure you know many people who have become extremely addicted to online games. The more they play these games the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved. Computers are a leading cause in dysfunctional families because they steal the user away from the outside world. These people need to get their families and friends back. You have to act now, before it's too late and computers have over taken the world. If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction, do what you can to help get them back. We need to cut back on any kind of computer use fast. Hurry, it's now or never before this digital dependency causes irreversible damage to our society and personal lives.
177	177	1	3	Dear school board, I strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days. There is so much to learn on a computer, and it is a lot more fun to learn off of a computer than a book. For instance, let's say a student had to do a report, but he couldn't get his hands on any book at all. All the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop up about any topic he wants to learn, providing instant access to a wealth of information. Another reason that a computer benefits society is the ways it provides to keep in contact with family and friends if they live too far away. Like me for instance, I live far from my friends, and the only way I could talk to them outside of school was on a computer. We would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game. The same goes with family. Let's say your children go on vacation and want to keep in touch. All you would have to do is type as much as you want and click send and it's at the other computer instantly. But, if you were to write a letter through the mail, it would take maybe a week or two to reach your child or the other way around. But, most of all, there are so many cool things you can do on a computer. There are a bunch of games to play, or videos to watch. You can make music and make money off of it. My favorite would have to be the computer programs. Flash macromedia is the best though; you get to make your own animation clips or even a movie. Computers are really fun to play on. A computer has so many advantages in today's society, which I'm very thankful for. I am grateful for computers and all of the great stuff they allow us to do, which is why I believe they are a significant benefit to our modern world.
178	178	1	3	"Dear sir or madam, computers play a big role in our world today. For example, people use computers to get information, talk in chat rooms, and mainly to talk to friends and find friends. I think this technology is messing people up. My first reason for thinking computers are messing people up is because of the information that is on the website. For example, people post and blog lies about people online. This ends up ruining many lives because it starts rumors and gossip about people. Also, the lies that are being posted could interfere with many lives, causing real-world consequences. Another reason computers negatively effect the lives of people is the dangerous chat rooms. This is not good because you're not familiar with the person you're talking to; the person could have posed as another person and be very hypocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasant. You might give them your number, address, or other personal information, and the outcome could end up in death, kidnapping, or cyber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false information that is given to thousands of people online. In other words, the ""you have won a prize"" or ""is your computer safe?"" These things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand, they attract the reader's attention. For example, these passages are set up to copy down your number, get your account number, and then take your money. This doesn't help our people because it's only there for your money. In conclusion, from my visible standpoint, I don't prefer computers as a magnificent way for people to spend their time, given these significant risks and deceptions."
179	179	1	3	Dear editor, you may have heard that there are up-sides and down-sides to using a computer. However, there are many more up-sides. For example, you can communicate with people, conduct business, and you can use it to learn. A computer is a big need in today's growing technological advances. Communication is not as easy to do by phone anymore because people are always busy and on the computer. You can use computers to meet people from different countries, and by doing this we can learn what life is like for them. Through social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, we can make plans with friends and stay connected. Computers are an important communication technology that bridges distances. Today most business is conducted over the internet or on a computer. The global stock market is all computerized today, and that is a major trade way. A lot of business transactions and presentations are done on a computer for maximum efficiency and speed. Computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without having to go there, making them a huge advancement in the business world. Furthermore, computers help us learn a lot about, just about, everything. Search engines let us type in keywords and find multiple websites on that topic in seconds. Computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click, and this research can be used to write essays in school or for personal knowledge. Computers help us to learn in school and outside of it, making education more accessible. A computer is a huge technological advancement with many uses. It may have a few down-sides, but it has many more up-sides that enhance our daily lives. Computers allow you to communicate, conduct business, and learn, and life would be much slower and more difficult without a computer to speed things up and connect us to the world.
180	180	1	3	In my opinion, having computers is a very nice thing and does good in our society. I think this because of three reasons: first, it allows people to relax and wind down after a long day of work. Second, it allows people to communicate with their friends, and third, it helps with schoolwork and makes things much easier. These are only a few of the reasons why computers do good in our society. First off, I'd like to say that after a long day of work, all you want to do is relax. Television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer. Well, that's a great way of winding down on a rough day. You can go on YouTube and watch funny videos or go on Facebook and comment on your friend's new photo album. Your personal computer can be used to do many things for entertainment. There are many games, such as online puzzles or strategy games, that can be a lot of fun. Do you see why the computer is a good way of calming down? Other than winding you down on a rough day at work, the computer also allows you to communicate with friends and family. Instant messaging is a good way to talk to friends and plan get-togethers. Or, you can just have a simple talk; Facebook and MySpace are great websites to keep in touch with old friends of yours, and you can even make new friends. A lot of teenagers and adults have Facebook because it gets so engaging that you can't get off it. As you get older, you don't talk to your friends that much and soon you don't have many friends at all. Social media prevents that so you can always talk to them; you should always keep in touch with friends. Most importantly, you use the computer for school work. Without it you can't get pictures off the internet or type an essay that's due. Furthermore, you can't search for words on a dictionary website. Some teachers require you to type out essays and others don't, so you need a computer if your teacher requires you to type things. I go on my school's website to see if I have homework due, and that helps me out a lot; some teachers even put extra credit online. All in all, computers are good for society. First, you can just calm down and relax after a stressful day. Second, you can talk to old friends and keep in touch with new ones. And third, and most importantly, it's very useful when it comes to schoolwork and looking up information. Now you must understand when I tell you that computers are important and very useful in our modern society for these compelling reasons.
181	181	1	3	"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are machines that have been around for @MONTH1 years. With the internet, you can do things like play games, research information, and even talk to friends and family, all through a computer. Advances in computer technology are beneficial to @CAPS1 society for several reasons. These includes that computers improve hand-eye coordination, provide abundant information, and allow people to talk online. As said earlier, using a computer can improve hand-eye coordination. In fact, it is known that computers can immensely improve your reflexes. This reminds me of a time when my brother went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing. Patrick, my brother, was then literally assigned by the doctor to play computer games to help his hand-eye coordination. As a matter of fact, @PERCENT1 agree that computers can have a gargantuah, positive impact on reflexes and hand-eye coordination. If computers are heldful in this way and, in some cases, necessary for your eyes, then why would the use of computers be classified as bad when they are clearly a beneficial factor in @CAPS1 society? Computers are also beneficial because of what a huge resource they are. The internet offers so much information for people of all ages who want to learn and thrive. For example, most schools have their students use computers for research. When I say most schoold, I mean @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to research using a computer. Principal of new city @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS1 students use computers at leat every week if not more. They are fantastic resource with endless information."" Computers are getway to countless amounts of knowledge that everyone should have access to. It is well known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away. I, myself, have a friend who lives in @LOCATION1 that I miss very much. When long-distance phone calls are too expensive for most of the world, I rely on computers to talk to our far-away friends. Computers are the bridge between @CAPS2; (my @CAPS3 friend) and I. However, computers are not only used for long distance. I also use computers to e-mail, instant message, video chat, and just stay connected to family and friends. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, says, ""I use my computer to stay connected with friends and my family that lives in another county. I don't know what I would do without it."" This means that @PERSON1 and thousands of others rely on computers for communication with friends and family. Computers are necessary for @MONTH1 reasons. They help people, educate, and connect people. You must have access to a computer in my opinion, in order to thrive in life and stay connected in our modern world."
182	182	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spent time on their computer. The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. You should go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen all the time. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family. Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family. These ar my reason why i think that we shouldn't be on the computers. We should spend more time with friends family or go outside, and enjoy nature for a healthier and happier life.
183	183	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer. My opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time. I think this because it takes away time from important tasks, there is something healthier than enclosing yourself with a computer monitor, that would be going outside or being active. Another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends. First, you shouldn't be spending so much time on the computer. You could be getting other tasks done. Such @CAPS2 working, or for most teens, doing homework. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such @CAPS2 ""@CAPS1"". ""twitter"", and ""aol"". People in the workplace are distracted two. Sometimes the job can get boring, so workers just go on the computer instead of getting things done. Children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little, but they go on the computer instead. Teens regular routine consists of waking up, getting ready, soing on the computer, school, coming home, snack, and then going back to the computer. We need to break those habits of going back to the computer. Staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy. Instead, you could be active in a sport, or just going outside and playing. ""@CAPS2 technology goes up seizure rates have also gone up,"" @CAPS3 to a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1. Being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online. Also, your not exercising while on the computer, being active keeps your shape along with being fun. The most important reason you shouldn't be on the computer for a long time is because your using valuable time you could have used to spend with family and friends. Most people barely see their family when their at home because their consumed in the computer. Laptops have made it easier to block people out. Bringing it into your room and shutting the door, is the most common way. Hang out with the friends your already talking to online, wouldn't it be better in person? In conclusion, we should limit our computer time to do other tasks, be active, and spend time with friends and family to lead a more balanced and fulfilling life."
184	184	1	3	Dear people that read the news paper and that have @CAPS1 that like to play the computer all day more than a hour. I think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper. I am writing this article about @CAPS1 using the computer more than an hour. My first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school. To support that reason so you dont think i am making this up is that they play the computer alot and it makes the @CAPS1 just think about the computer and not think about school. They play it so much and it can mess up the @CAPS1 and they can not focus in school. My second main reason is it makes them allways want to talk about the computer. So if they play it mare than a hour like i said it can cause them to be addicted like drug's it is just like that if you dont want your @CAPS1 to be addicted to drugs i hope you woudnt want your own @CAPS1 to be addicted to the computer. To continue about your @CAPS1 can allways @CAPS2 about the computer it can make your @CAPS1 sound like they have no life because they play it all day everday and I would hope you woudnt want your @CAPS1 to be like this. Most importantly my final reason why you shoudnt let your child play the computer for more than a hour a day. Because they can get over weight. Your @CAPS1 well only get up and go to the bathroom, and eat, they will only do stuff that is in the house. Your @CAPS1 will not go out side and play and they wont get no exerse at all. I hope you will understand where I am coming from I have a brother that is offering in the hospital right computer too much and it messed and the doctor said he make it not so I am praying that he well make it out alive so I hope you woudnt let you @CAPS1 do this it will mess up their life forever. Thank you so much for takeng you own @CAPS4 Time to read this article I hope you would remember this article for your whole ontire life and make the right choice for your @CAPS1.
185	185	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are many people who use computers this advanced technology we have. Lots of people life that we had computers they have lots of benefits that come with having computers. But not everyone agrees with this @CAPS2 are many people who donít like that people use computers to much it takes away less time from enjoying nature, exerising, and interesting with family and friends. But I think on people with computer such as talking to people who you cant see, looking up information gives people something to do. One of the effects computers have on people is it allows you to talk to people you really dont see. I say this beacause not all your friends go to the same school so you dont see them as much. But they might have email, myspace, and facebook. Surf you cant online. It makes it easier to talk to them instad of driving so you can see them. I think that is @CAPS2 are activities you have to do or other activities, they need to do The second effect computers has on people it allows you to look up information. Think of it have you to do a project and you dont always have enough information on what it is to do it. But if your computer it gives lots of you can find information. I think that computer can help you in that way the endless sites of information and of better. Also the might be times go on a trip and know how much it cost and how long its going to take to set to you destination. Well if you look it upon the computer it will be all their for you to see also where else will you find this information you call to questions when consist go to the website. The third effect computers have on people are it gives you something to do. I say this because not all the time will you me to do something to do. Sometimes you will be bored something to do go on computer. The things you can do like play games. Also watch videos on youtube. For example you funny keeps you laughin add on the computer you watch videos. Another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now. See these @MONTH1 things you can go on the computer. To conclude I think that computers have lots of effects on people. These are about computer how people spend time on them. But I disagree is many good effects computers can have on people. I hope you agree with me. These are the three effects computers has on people allows you look up information, gives you something to do, and helps you stay connected with others.
186	186	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I am writing to persuade you to put an article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people. Computers make you unhealthy, bullying takes place on the computer, and it effects how you do in school. First, computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy. I say this because most people don't get enough exercise, choosing to sit for long hours in front of a screen instead of being active. Then you get obese from not having enough exercise, which can lead to other health problems. Eventually you may or may not get diabetes from being obese, but most of the time you do, showing a clear health risk. The next reason why computers have bad effects is because kids get bullied on the internet. This is important because when kids get bullied they feel bad about themselves and their self-esteem suffers. Then they all get very depressed, which is a serious mental health issue. This is called cyber bullying. One example is, is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son. His son had killed himself from being bullied on the internent and at school, a tragic outcome of online harassment. That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people. My third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school. They do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes, leading to poor grades. Also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer, so they do not pay attention in class. Kids also do bad in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out, ending their education early. It is a proven fact that a significant percentage of kids that have dropped out of school was kids that were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time. Thats how a computers have on effect on school. Now remember, computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy, leading to obesity. People gets bullied online, which causes depression, and it has on effect on your schoolwork, resulting in poor performance. That is how computers have bad effects on people.
187	187	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think that people should have computers. I think that because kids play game to help them learn like math game or reading games, which make education more engaging. Grown ups can go on websites and watch work out videos to stay fit, and they could pay there bills on the computer to, making life more convenient, and they dont have it in the store, saving time. Of course, kids need to do there homework and computers are good for that, providing access to information. But they also have bad stuff like kids say they are doing there homework but they are on youtube myspace or facebook, getting distracted from their studies, or other stuff like games. But computers have more good stuff about them than bad things, offering many useful tools and resources. So that is why I think we should have computers, as their benefits outweigh the drawbacks for learning and daily tasks.
188	188	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Some people say computers have negative affects on family and friend others say computers are an important aspect of society. I would have to agree with the second group of people. Computers help students research information that they might need for school, making studying more efficient. People can talk to there friends on things like facebook or other platforms and you can write a rough draft on the computer save it then go back to it and make the final changes from a draft to a final, which improves the writing process. I will elaborate in the following points. Computers are a quick and easy way to look up information for a school project or paper, providing instant access to knowledge. I can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time but so would a book, as both are activities done alone. A book would probably take up more time and you might get less information, making research slower. For example the book could be about multiple people and you read the entire thing only to get two sentences of information, whereas a computer search finds it quickly. Another reason computer reasearch is quicker is that you can go from one page get some information and then once you have gotten all the information from that page but you still need more you can just click another link, navigating sources easily. If people didn't have computers they would have to go to the library and spend time looking them, which is less convenient. Is it worth it to use all that time when a computer is faster? People can talk to there friends on facebook or other social media sites. Some people say computers distract you from friends when really they help you talk to your friends more, maintaining connections. What if your on vacation and your so tired of seeing and talking to your family because you've been with them non stop for a week and you miss your friends, a computer lets you reach out. All you have to do is turn on the computer and then you have an intent link to them, allowing for instant communication. Chat rooms also help you meet other people your age from the next town over on enywhere in the country, expanding social circles. They might even became your new best friend, showing how computers foster relationships. When you write a paper do you want to have to write it once then go back and write it several more times? Theres a much simpler way it's called a computer. You can write your first draft then all you have to do inordre to get a final copy is reread it and make changes when they are nessecary, streamlining editing. Computers also help kids spell better with tools like spell check. All they have to do is hit a button to correct mistakes, improving their writing skills and confidence.
189	189	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Everywhere you turn there is technology. It's not going to change, so we must learn to manage it. Try a schedule to balance computer use with other activities. Encouragment helps a lot of people stay motivated to reduce screen time. Activities keep you mind off things and promote a healthier lifestyle; read on to find our more. Scheduleing is important for setting boundaries. Limit the time on the computer to prevent overuse. For every half hour spent on the computer, spend at least a few minutes outside or with friends to stay active and social. try to memorize the schedule so it becomes a habit. Encouragement helps me and alot of people stick to their goals! Try to encourage family and friends to join you in limiting computer time, making it a group effort. The goverment is also trying to fight this issue with public awareness campaigns. Encouragement helps build positive habits. Activities can keep people off the computer by providing fun alternatives. Try neighborhood activities like sports or games to engage with others. After-school activities for a while can fill time productively. All kinds of stuff is fun and can replace computer use. Do you think scheduling helps? Do you like encouragement? Do activities keep you mind off things? then by far this stuff helps create a balanced life with less reliance on technology.
190	190	1	3	"Dear Editor, Can you imagine a world where technology controls human interaction? Its not such a far fetched idea. Some people might see this as a great advancement in how we connect. Not me. I think that computers detach people from reality, create false personas, and has no physical benefit. This is what i think the computers effects have on people. First of all, Computers detach people from reality by replacing real-world experiences with virtual ones. Its a lot easier for someone to sit on the computer, browsing aimlessly on some social networking website, than go out and actually meet new people in person. Sure you can send all the friend requests you want, but theres nothing that compares to a first impression that you get from meeting someone in person, with all the nuances of face-to-face communication. The computer can also have an affect on family members and the time spent with them, reducing quality interactions at home. Secondly, the computer creates false personas because online, people can present idealized versions of themselves. If i had a facebook or other social media account, it would be very easy to say something false about myself, or someone else, without immediate consequences. The computer dosn't know better, so it doesn't verify the truth. This allows people to gain, ""friendships"" with others that dont know the real you, based on deception. I find this as a real problem because it can eventually lead to shaky or unsteady relationships when the truth emerges. Lastly, I think that the computer offers no physical gain, as it promotes a sedentary lifestyle. This nation is in a severe heath crisis with rising obesity rates. With things easier to get now a days like fast food, and drugs, I don't think that computers help our physical well-being; they often contribute to inactivity. People need discipline to use technology in moderation, and theres a time and place for everything, including computers for work or study. However those that aren't disciplined might use them more than they need to and that isn't good for their health. So can you imagine a world controlled by computers? I think that little by little, thats whats happening, with screens dominating our lives. Slowly taking away the human element from our daily interactions. I think the effects will be severe, detaching us from reality, creating false personas, and offering no physical gain, leading to a less healthy society. I don't think its right, but I hope I've persuaded you to think my way about the negative impacts of computers on our lives."
191	191	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1, I understand that you have some concerns about computers. I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very positive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with family and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people's reflexes by making their eyes more keen and their responses quicker. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feel like you are really there through vivid pictures and videos. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meet in person, learning about their cultures and traditions. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with all of your friends and family, sharing photos and updates. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy, even when they are miles apart. In conclusion I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them.
192	192	1	3	How @MONTH1 times do you use the computer in one day? A lot right? I think that computers definitely benefit society. The internet helps a lot of people, because its very convenient; computers give people access to a world of information. The computers also lets people talk online with other people. Computers help people because of the internet. The internet makes a lot of people's lives easier. One way is for school. I know from my own experiences that the internet helps. If I don't have enough material to study, the internet helps me find it. Another reason that the internet is helpful is for jobs. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of people the age of @NUM1 have jobs on the internet? The internet can also help people find jobs through online listings and applications. The last reason that the internet is helpful is shopping. I remember a time when I needed a special book for school and no bookstore had it, so my mum ordered it online; the internet is very helpful to many people. My point that computers are beneficial to our society is that they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. Many people cannot afford to go to a lot of places outside the United States. With computers, people can learn about these places and see pictures of these places. Sometimes there is even a simulation to experience of being there. Another reason is that people are curious and want to learn more. Once, my family got to a wedding in @LOCATION1, but we didn't know much about @LOCATION1. So we went online to find things like the foods eaten there and what the weather is like. Lastly people can learn about where their family came from. If people know the place that their ancestors came from, they can look it up using computers. They can find recipes for food, what religion they practice, and what holidays they celebrate. Obviously computers help people learn about faraway places. My last reason that computers are beneficial to our society is that they allow people to talk with other people. Sometimes, good friends who used to be together lose touch; with a computer, people can find them online and talk. Did you know that there are many sites that tell you where people you went to high school with are? Also, there are sites like Facebook where people can connect and share life updates. Another reason is that people can meet other people online. There are many dating sites that connect people using the internet. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of people on dating sites find a partner? Sometimes people cannot call each other because it's too long distance. Being able to chat online on sites like Google Chat or Skype is very helpful. Without a doubt, computers are very helpful. I think that computers help @CAPS1 many people in our society. People use the internet to help them with tasks. People learn about other places and people can chat online. @CAPS1, don't think badly about computers, because they have impacted our society greatly!
193	193	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 weekly, The new millennium brought a new wave of technology. Computers is the main invention that most likely everyone uses. The computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far off country. The computer allows us to talk to friends or family while they are away or even home. Also, typing on the computer teaches us hand eye coordination that can help us with other things. The computer is surely a great invention. Have you ever wanted to go on vacation to somewhere overseas? Well the computer is a great source for learning about these places. The effects it has could be significant. One day someone might want to go to the Bahamas, but then finds a new location such as @LOCATION1 or even @LOCATION3 through online travel blogs. In addition the computer benefits students very well. Students usually have to do projects on places in the world and the computer is the main source of intelligence, providing access to encyclopedias and academic journals. When I have an essay to do I always use the computer first. Recently my grandmother moved down to @LOCATION2 and I can only talk to her on the phone. Although on my computer I can actually see her on my screen. The webcam allows me to see my grandma, which makes our conversations more personal. The computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular basis. For example, @CAPS1 or Twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school, allowing you to see their daily posts. The computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while. Sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination. The computer makes you better at this. By looking at the screen while typing, gives you a boost on your hand-eye coordination because you are doing two things at once, training your brain and fingers to work together. A sport that requires a lot of this is @CAPS2. While the ball is in the air you must focus on it while holding your stick at the correct position. Although hand-eye coordination is mainly taught through the powers of the computer. To conclude, all that I would like to say is that the computer is a great source for intelligence. It also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family. Finally, the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer is a very important piece of technology that enriches our lives.
194	194	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you want our society to become one of obese, lazy people with no appreciation for family or friends? @CAPS2 you want people to lack a respect for nature? This is the result of excessive computer usage; our society will become lazy, and dependent upon robot slaves and lose its way, becoming brain washed. People will not be caring for family or friends. Most importantly, our society will have no appreciation or respect for mother nature. Is this the way you wish our world to be? Have you ever read @CAPS3 @NUM1? In the book, the government uses technology to brainwash people and then manipulate them. If our society, like the one in the book, becomes over dependent on computers and technology, then we will collapse from the inside, going from a respected world power, to a third world country in decline. We will need to redesign buildings to have doors big enough for our bodies to fit through. We will not be a respected nation anymore. There will be charities in other countries to send money to build gyms and pools, but nobody will use them. Recent research from @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computer every day are over @NUM2 pounds. People won't remember how to talk properly. Babies will learn to type instead of talking or walking. Is this good for our country? People say that the best thing you could ever have is a supportive family and a group of good friends. According to @PERSON1, a well known psychologist, ""People who have more friends have a @PERCENT2 reduced risk of depression."" Friends actually affect your health. People who use the computer too much lose friends and become separated from their families. The mental health effects from this can be horrible, and people sadly will miss out on all the positive parts of life. It's important that people are happy, but if you only communicate through e-mail and social networking sites, you aren't social enough. It is one thing to chat online, but it is better to be able to see someone face to face than a picture on screen. Nobody wants to end up like this, so limit your computer usage. With too much computer usage comes a lack of respect for nature. People used to care for nature for many reasons, but the biggest is that it affects us everyday, in everything we do and own. Everything has a base in nature, even ourselves. The weather outside, even on a beautiful @DATE1 day, can be deadly if we don't pay attention to what is going on outside of our safe house. We depend on nature but if we don't respect her, she will kill us. Anything is good in moderation, even a computer. But when we don't limit ourselves, it has bad consequences. We will no longer have a respected society. Our family and friends will disappear, causing health problems. Worst of all, we will lose all expectation and respect for mother nature. The time to start limiting computer usage is now, or we will have many great problems in the future."
195	195	1	3	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 idea about ""Computers"" is very well thought outside of the box. Well, we sure need computers to look up information these days. Why do we need them now and it didn't exist before? Research shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything. Let me explain a little bit further to you what I mean. First, you can look up places, chat with friends and family, and find answers to almost any question. @CAPS1 opinion about using the local internet would be that it's good only for those who know how to use it responsibly and not trying to be mean. For little children, the world should never forget to get to bed at least by @NUM1 pm, and never to forget about nature outside and fresh air. It is important to balance screen time with outdoor activities. In conclusion, the internet these days is very good for people when used wisely and in moderation."
196	196	1	3	I think the use of computers is very good things in the present day. I think this because people use it to research, stay in touch with friends and family, and music. These are all things adults and kids need and like to do. Read on and I will explain why this is so important. My first reason why I think computers are good thing is because they are a good source to do research on a specific topic. Kids all over the world use the internet to do class projects and find information for their homework. Adults can use the computer to look up a certain food recipe or to find instructions for fixing things around the house. If you need help with something the computer is always there. Some people even use the computer for a job, like writing or designing. Computers can help with a lot of things. Another reason why computers are a big help is because you can stay in touch with friends and family. A great thing to use on a computer is a web cam. With this you can see and talk to people on a little camera even if they are far away. You can also go on Myspace or Facebook. These are two websites that are used to post pictures and to talk to chosen friends. It is a good way for people to get to know you and share life updates. A similar thing to this is instant messaging. You can use this to talk to friends and many others online. Don't stop reading there is more thing! My last reason why computer are such a great thing to have is because you can do so much with music on the computer. You can use the computer to listen to music, and put music on to an iPod or MP3 player. Some people use the computer to make music. You can get a program that you can make beats and put it together to make some kind of a song. Music is a great thing that all age groups love. That is why I think having a computer is a very positive thing. You can do researching, stay in touch with friends and family, and do a lot with music. There is so much more then these three things that a computer is good for. I don't think the world would be the same without computers.
197	197	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I know that computers can place a person in its spell, but in reality it's one of the most necessary things we need in our lifetime. Computers are used for many things like school work, planning that trip you always wanted to go to, and reading the latest news. Read the following to know just how important computers really are. You know now when you have that project due for science class about protoplasms. You want to do as well as you can so you have that A. When you realize that the one book you find on it won't help you with the score you want you realize that the next place to look is the computer. The computer gives you an unlimited amount of information that will help you in any report. When a teacher gives you a book to do a biography on, for example, ""The life and times of a famous author"" you want to go beyond what they give you and search, for instances, his neighborhood, his inspiration, and the influences he had. You will find all this in the computer. When you see a sale on a ""five nights and four days"" trip to a popular resort, you want to know what better sale they have. When you start to notice that your family needs a vacation what is the only place to look. You can't look for that trip of a lifetime in a book. Sure you can find out that a travel agency is having that big blowout sale, but you can't search up the best deal. I've done a research with seven of my friends and that six of those seven parents have found a deal on a trip to a theme park on their accounts. If you're a great fan of road trips you'll find a deal for rental cars for the lowest price only find out by computer. If you live in a small town and you want to have a trip to the coast this deal is really good. If you live in the city and you know the hottest day of the year is coming you will be ready to get those beach balls and that blanket ready, but if you think computers are a waste of time then you won't know that all the beaches are open and will be sending free drinks all day. You will be at home eating a TV dinner watching old reruns of a classic show. Not only will it tell you news in your area, but will tell you about that devastating earthquake in another country. You'll also be informed about what people are doing to help them and what you can do to help. So not only is the computer good for going on social media and email, you can help get your grade to an A+ on that history report. It also works well for giving your children a memory they will always remember. They also help you to get ready and not be stuck in your house on that nice day. Maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is."
198	198	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, recent studies show that a large percentage of humans alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. I believe that the effect of computers has a negative effect on humans because it creates people to have a lack in exercise and it limits the physical interaction with others. As a nation, we can lower the statistic above and create a better environment altogether. The amount of people that lack a sufficient quantity of exercise has risen in the past decade. A doctor, who is expert in the connections between health and computers, surveyed a group of people. Out of those people, a significant number said they rarely go outside because they are trapped in the cyber world. This shocking percent proves that only one in twenty people actually get some type of exercise. One expert stated, ""this shocking data means that most -if not all- people are unhealthy physically, which is a problem that must be solved."" The report goes on to say that being on a computer for most of the day and not exercising is what contributes to unhealthiness. In addition to lacking exercise, many humans are losing the physical interaction that they should have. As humans have become modernized with technology, most humans lose the physical interaction that they would normally have encountered if they were not on the computer. One person agreed with this statement and said, "" I am a college graduate; I have a degree and all, but I wasn't always like this. When I was younger, I owned a computer. As soon as I got home from school, I would always go on the computer. I wouldn't talk to anyone-not even my family! If I could go back and change that, I would."" This statement proves that the lack of physical interaction with human is a crucial subject to touch on. This person regretted it all and changed his ways once he got to high school. No one wants to live with regrets, so physical human interactions are necessary to live a non-regretful life. The lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible. In conclusion, using computers has started a growing epidemic. The most important reasons as to why computers have a negative effect on humans are it limits the amount of exercise, and it almost destroys the physical interactions between humans. Thank you for your attention, and remember one thing: Computers can always have a negative effect on many humans lives."
199	199	1	3	Click, clack that the sound of computer keys being hit right now. Computers are everywhere these days, even in the poorest places. In many countries, dreadful, humble, time conservative computers are taking away the meaning and enjoyments of life that are offered to us. Computers are our source of information, and time of leisure these days, but we are forgetting that there is a life away from them as well such as having family time, and taking walks in the beautiful nature. Too much use of a computer is leading to awful health. Computers can cause many fatal problems such as seeing and vision problems, and obesity, due to the fact that you sit all day and don't work out. Computers are like mind, and body eaters they slowly take away from you and let you cry, and weep for the rest of your life, don't you agree? Do you know that a health organization says that the second biggest leading cause of obesity is computer? Yes that is true! I have experienced this problem while growing up. When I was young I was addicted to the computer. Day and night my eyes were glued to the computer screen. I had nothing on my mind except the computer, my mom got mad at me and yelled at me to get away from it, but I didn't. Slowly, slowly I started to put on heavy, awful fat on myself, and later I found out I was over weight for my age. To this day I have not lost the weight I put on from using the computer, and I am sure others are too. Obesity just doesn't happen from eating too much. It also happens from not doing any cardio activities, which the computer stops us from doing. So basically the computer is unhealthy. As said by a large percentage of people from the state. Time consuming computers, are taking away family time from many families these days. Do you know that a majority of families aren't getting to spend the time with each other as they wish, reason being computers? Kids are on the computer playing games, moms finding a recipe online to make for dinner, and dad is buying another stock online. Yes that happens a lot, instead of doing those things they could be doing something else, but no computer work is more important. My family used to spend a lot of time together, but because of the computer I never get to do anything with my family now. Do you know that time health organizations say kids who spend time with their family are bound to become better parents than who don't spend time with family. I bet you are a really good family man/woman and spend time with yours; please take these computers away and make families come together once again. Our country has the most beautiful nature ever, the birds, the animals, the summer times and the fall time. If anyone ever wants to see nature they should come here, but the sad thing is that the people of this country aren't appreciating nature themselves because they are too busy with things such as computers. I know one time we went to a camp out, and we were ready for nature and this boy brings his computer, and wouldn't you know it the whole group of people forgot about nature and played with the boys computer. So many people missed out on the nature and the beautiful animals seen at the time such as yellow butterflies; that time was amazing and it is very unfortunate that many people missed out on that event. People these days are once again not appreciating nature, which one day they will regret, because of the fact that one day you may not be around to enjoy this God given gift; don't let the computer tell you what to do lets be the boss and control ourselves. It is now or never the decision is in your hand, make the right decision and say no to computers. Go out there enjoy nature, spend time with you family, and get healthy. Be the smart, and well educated people (I know you are) and tell the world to not get told by the computer of what you can, and can't do, be the boss. Yes computers are fun, giving, but is bad. Say no to computers if you don't you will regret it.
200	200	1	3	"Dear Readers of the local paper, it has been brought to my attention that there is a dilemma on the effect of computers on people. Well I believe that having computers around are good because. Computers help students do their school work better. They also give the ability to learn about far away places. Lastly, computers allow people to talk to other people online or webcam. My first reason I believe computers are good to have around is. They help students do their school work. Sometimes teachers give assignments out and you have to write an essay. If the student does it on a computer they might get a higher grade because it looks neater and more professional. Computers especially help out college students. A college university took a poll one time. A high percentage of students wouldn't know what to do if they didn't have their computer or laptop. One student even said ""If I didn't have my laptop I would probably fail most of my classes."" Computers can be very helpful when it comes to student school work. My second reason that I believe computers are good to have around is. They give the ability to learn about far away places or other countries. I took a poll one time of how many people use a computer to find out whats going on in other countries, a large number of them said they go on the computer to find out what's going on in another countries. Computers can be very handy when you want to know whats going on in other countries or plan a future visit. My last reason why computers are good to have around is. Say you are married and you are pregnant unless your a guy of course, but your spouse is in another country and you couldn't see them. Well computers these days have webcams. So now if you really need to talk to him or her you can by using webcam. So readers of the local paper. Can you see now why I believe that having computers around is good. It helps students do their school work. It gives the ability to learn about far away places and countries. It also gives the chance to talk to people with webcams."
201	201	1	3	Computers and modern technology are advancing quickly, and more and more people are beginning to use them. Some people say that computers are a bad influence on @LOCATION1. I think other wise. I think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science. I believe computers are ideal for school work and comunicating with others, as long as they are used in moderation. Computers make school projects so simple I don't know if we could do without. Our social studies teacher @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of his projects involve something on the computer. The internet is a great place to research for big papers and projects. With over thirty-million educational and informational websites, its easy to locate what you need quickly and easily. Once you have finished researching it is easy to type your report. If it isn't a written report, then there are many other programs for fancy presentations. Take microsoft @CAPS1 for example: you can make exotic background and texts, as well as unique animations to emphasize or to make it pop right off the page. Computers are also an ideal way to communicate with friends and family. Emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say. If you want to chat, then you can use @CAPS2 or instant messaging. This allows you to type and sent emails faster. Both of these programs are an inivative way to talk with a family member that isn't home. Like lets say my dad goes on business to @LOCATION2. We can email back and forth every day. And now with @ORGANIZATION1 (a video chat) you can see the person and actually talk to them like they're back at home. Computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages. Computers are great for communicating and school work, but when used in excess can be unhealthy. Here is one example: my older brother @PERSON2 is a senior in high school. He is in school from @NUM1 to @NUM2:pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer. He is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep. This kind of excessive use can lead to eye strain and social isolation. I think that computers are a great invation in modern technology as long as people limit themselves. Computers are coming out with new features everyday and who know theyll be like in the future, but their benefits are undeniable when used responsibly.
202	202	1	3	I completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today. Even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them. Since new technology, and post pictures on websites where everyone can see. Also they have games for computers that people get hooked on. Lastly, there are predator online. The new technology is amazing, like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures, @CAPS1 they do have negative effects. There have been many suicides over cyber bullying. This is where people bully kids over the internet. Also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming. this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions. Also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life. There are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites. Most people actually get addicted to the game, They would play it all day if they could and if they arent playing they are wishing they could. This makes them miss out on alot of things. They might not get enough excersise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop. They could also not be spending time with family. It also might change who you are as a person. The most important thing about the use of computers is your safety. There are predator all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live. You should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online. They can and most likely will come to your house for you. It could most likely cost you or even family members your lives. Computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it. Remember not to tell anyone where you live or dont take pictures and send them that are personal. They could be all over the internet the next day. Lastly, worry about your family, grades, and health than some useless game. Be smart and safe and always prioritize your real-world well-being over your digital activities.
203	203	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think people need computers. It helps them see the world if they can't. It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. So here is examples of these three things. Some people can't physically or mentally and can't afford to travel. Its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can't go places. But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they've never been to which can help them see the world better. But there are people who can help them see the world better. But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. Then there are people who can't afford it. So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. What happened and that it wasn't what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can't talk or see them. Someones in the military and he/she has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. Also you see a friend in facebook who you haven't seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. It can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world. Which isn't bad sure we sometimes go over board with it but it is very useful. It isn't horrible but it is sometimes bad but also sometimes good but ultimately, its benefits in connecting and informing us are profound.
204	204	1	3	You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question noone in your home can answer. Why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Of course once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't @CAPS3 what to do. Simple, all you have to do is reasearch it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over @PERCENT1 of jobs out in the world relie on the technology of a computer. For example the @ORGANIZATION1 job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do? There are some lawyers incart who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying. Did you @CAPS3 that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is @CAPS4. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget @CAPS5. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be @CAPS6 @CAPS7. That game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain. Strategy come in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never do you agree that computers have positive effects on people? Their role in modern life is simply indispensable.
205	205	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I've just been informed about how people view computers and the effects of them. In my opinion, I find computers to be a very negative influence on yound kids, teens, and adults. Many harmful awarenesses come along with having one. For one thing, people being so hypnotized in this electronical device are finding lesser time to excercise and take care of themselves. Also to, the only nature they're experiencing is pictures online and not enjoying the full beuty of what we have left of out earth. Another negative outcome is that they start becoming more and more distant from their loved ones. What happened to our society? Why can't we think on our own anymore? I truely, strongly hope that what i'm saying will change the minds of some people. Thank you very much. Exercise is a very key aspect in anyone's life. Especially growing kids and teens. On the computer what exercise benefits are you getting? Stronger fingers? A higher chance of syndrome @CAPS10. ""@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of kids having @CAPS7 problems like obesity have access to the internet"", accoding to @PERSON2 of the, ""@CAPS3 feel right with @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" in hunington beach, @LOCATION1. When basically, your giveing youself to the computers, you @MONTH1 not have any thoughts at all of staying fir. Instead on some chips while typing. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 BENEFITS @CAPS8 that game help? With global warming by ourside, what you saw yesterday @MONTH1 not be there today. Breathing in some fresh, natural air can really calm a stressed child out. What ever happened to playing an endless scoth with side walk chalk and fresh? or tag or just running around? Is it not cool anymore? Yah, not cool to take care of yourself. Inspire yourself by writing poems about how you feel or draw a screnary. Now a days, instead of @CAPS10 climing a tree, were climbing our mouse arrow to the next website. There's so much that we all take for granted, that one day when you look back on ti all, youre going to really miss those @DATE1 days. Family time is so critical in anyone's life. Without a family, you're nothing. When did game night or family time disapear? Just because we're in a society that says computers are completely normal everyday thing in a house, doesn't mean you family and friends aren't a main priority to you anymore. If you want to hangout a friend's house, dont email about it, walk @CAPS2 there and get the full affect since when does a computer a family? Never. If we got out of a fake reality, @CAPS10 there wouldn't be negativity in our life. @CAPS10 you can regain a true life back with them. @CAPS10 you'd think more clearer just @CAPS10. Whats makes a computer any better than life? Nothing ask yourself that. So inconclusive, I strongly believe that with this in you lives we've actually get dumber. There's more negative than positives in having a computer. Sure you could quickly send them a message or like @CAPS9, but is it ever bad to do the good old fashion calling? Or sendin letter? I say again, thank you for taking out your time to read this. @CAPS10 i changed you, @CAPS10 not. Whatever you do, think about the next time you're online and see what happends and consider stepping away to experience the real world."
206	206	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I do agree that computers have impacted human society greatly. Therefore, my opinion is that the computer is one of the greatest inventions. I would say this because there are different help programs or websites that can help people in everyday life. Especially students have the ability to study from education webpages, which offer a vast array of resources. Also, people are able to communicate online with ease. Lastly, you are able to type stories instead of hand-writing them, which is a significant convenience. Having the advantage to study online is great. Different websites with tons of information and true facts can really affect grades of most students. Did you know about a significant percentage of the student population go on educational websites for information for writing, whether it's an essay or non-fiction story? Thanks to computers, there is a great chance students will receive a passing grade. Communication online has made huge impact worldwide. Whether you use facebook, email, or various messaging platforms etc., communicating with family or friends is fantastic. For example, I use facebook and I love talking to my family down in another state, whom I see about once every couple years. Online communication has affected people because there is an easier way to talk to other instantly. Just a push of a button, and you have immediate communication with someone. Finally, people have the ability to type on a program if they wanted to type a letter or story. For instance, if you use microsoft word, you can type up whatever you want. This has affected people because it is a faster and easier way to write. Therefore, if you finish earlier than you would have if you wrote it by hand, you would have extra leisure time, or more time to get the rest of your work done. Also, it is easy for me because I type like the wind; after practice, of course. In conclusion, the invention of computers helped and still do help society in many ways. But, the three ways that i have chosen to tell you about in this letter, I feel, have impacted us the most. I hope this helps you with you questions about how computers affected people. Thank you for taking time to read my letter. Have a good day.
207	207	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe a computer isn't harmful in any way. It helps people learn about things they didn't know, expanding their knowledge base. Also it lets people interact with people around the world, breaking down geographical barriers. Another is that it lets people stay in touch with family and friends around the globe, strengthening relationships. Computers don't harm, they help. Computers are a learning tool. Schools like mine have over a hundred computers but they are only used for education, ensuring a focused environment. Anyway even if we try to go on different sites we get redirected to a blocked website. Cars and other machines were built by computers which supplied the blueprints, demonstrating their practical application. There is one thing computers are mostly used for, and thats to learn. Are you thinking about going on vacation somewhere but don't know how things work around there? Well a computer can help you with those problems. It lets you see how people are and what the place looks like with a virtual tour. Even with some assistance if you don't know about traditions or beliefs, you can find information easily. Computers are a great way to explore. Computers are a great way to communicate with others. Family members that live on the otherside of the world can use computers to talk and see how your doing. How about old friends that moved away. You can still talk and communicate with each other regularly. Getting in touch with friends and family isn't all that bad is it? And these are reason to show how computers aren't harmful in anyway. It gives people a good education. It lets people learn about cultures of places around the world. And talking to friends is something thats good, not bad. This is why computers don't harm people, they help them in numerous ways.
208	208	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, I have recently heard that some people think that computers have a negative effect on people. Well i think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps make learning about other countries easier, providing instant access to global information. Also, it helps people talk to people from different countries, fostering international connections. Another reason is that it helps people learn about different cultures, religions, or traditions, promoting understanding and tolerance. The reason why some people think that computers have a negative effect on people is because people are spending more time on the computer than spending time with their family. Also, people use the computer more than they use exercise machines, bicycles, or scooters, which can impact physical health. Now that you know about the positive and negative effects of computers, Which side will you choose? the one against computers or the one for computers. I would choose the one for computers because their benefits in education and communication are invaluable.
209	209	1	3	Dear local newspaper editor, My opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad; it does not rot your brain like some say video games might. There are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination, especially when using the mouse and keyboard. You use the computer to do homework or to search for stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of them, especially the new ones for this year; computers can also help you read better as it has little tools to assist. You could play games or talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to do; you could visit a website that has all the songs that you like to listen to. Many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out. Paying bills online is easier than paying them in person. The computer is an easy way to pay and you should agree with my opinion that computers are largely beneficial.
210	210	1	3	Dear Newspaper, The question is whether or not people are spending too much time on the computer or not. In my opinion people aren’t, and there are many benefits from being on the computer. Typing on the computer teaches hand-eye coordination. It is easy to learn while on computer too, and you can all communicate with people also! Hand-eye coordination is very important. We use it everyday during sports, taking notes, even playing video games! Being on the computer is good because it develops hand-eye coordination. Whatever you do on the computer—typing, playing online game, or surfing the web—develops hand-eye coordination. It is good to learn hand-eye coordination because most teachers these days want children to type and print their papers, so they are neater. If kids can learn hand-eye coordination, they can type faster and turn their work in on time when they go on their computer. My world cultures teacher lets us use an online textbook if we don't finish our homework in class, instead of lugging around a heavy textbook. Any student would rather go online than have to bring a giant textbook to and from school. Have you ever thought about how much easier it is to take a college course online? Then having to go to college, especially for working parents? Everything happens online in your portable laptop, instead of having to go to and from a college. Using computer to learn about different places is easy. There are websites full of pictures of beautiful foreign places that show hot deserts, and tropical rainfalls with monkeys and tigers. It is fun and easy to learn on a computer. Since cell phones have become so common, a lot of people have gotten rid of their home phone to save money. Sometimes, though, cellphones lose signal. That is why it is good to have a computer. It is easy to talk to other people on forums, chats, websites and email. You can have intelligent conversations, and its easy and free! It is easy to communicate using a computer. Surely you've heard my reasons; its okay for people to spend time on the computer and you see my point. Yes people shall spend time outside or with family, but in small doses the computer is good for you. It is easy to learn hand coordination and communicate on a computer, making it a valuable modern tool.
211	211	1	3	Not everyone thinks computers are good for you, but they are a very good resource to find information. It's not good to be on the computer for seven hours straight, but to be on sometimes is not bad at all. A person who is on the computer all day and does nothing else except that, then that is not healthy at all. People just have to limit their time on how much they stay on the computer. Don't over do it! Computers are also very good for information, as I said earlier. If you have a computer or a laptop and you need to find information on something, the internet is right there for you. For kids that need to do homework or a project and they need to look up some facts or information on something, they could go on the computer for that. It is so much easier to do that than to look for books that have all the facts you need. So computers have very good qualities and resources. They aren't bad or unhealthy unless that is your life and that is the only thing you do. That is my opinion on computers and their place in our lives.
212	212	1	3	I think that people are spending a lot of time on their computers and not enjoying nature and other things. My reasons are that people don't do anything except surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and they sit around eating junk and getting no exercise. Those are my three reasons. My first reason is that people surf the web. There is over a million websites to go to. What people do is go to all of them, look at things, or buy something. The only thing they should be doing is homework or business. Also, people play too many video games on the computer too. My second reason is that people go on social media or use web cams. Those people could be on there for hours talking to people. Sometimes those things are people's life and all they do. I know someone who uses social media and after school all they do is talk to people online. They have friends on the internet but no friends in real life. My third reason is when people do go on the computer, all they do is eat junk food and get no exercise. Sometimes they eat potato chips and cookies and have soda. If you do that for a week you will be very tired and sleepy. Also you can get very fat. Your body will be unhealthy and out of shape. Now that you have read my reasons, I hope you like them. My reasons were that people don't do anything but surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and people eat junk food and get no exercise, which is why we should spend less time on computers.
213	213	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I just wanted to say that I do agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer. My reasons are that people need to exercise, go out doors, and have fun. If you keep reading you'll understand why they need to do these things. My first reason was exercising. And the reason why I say exercising is because you don't need to be on the computer all day long. So many things that they can do, is run, jog, and go for bike rides. I mean it's ok to go on the computer once and a while to learn but that's why they have books, and school to learn about things. My second reason was going outside and the reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day. Another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time. My other reason was nature. And what I mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there too. Another thing is that you can do much more without being on the computer all day long. My last reason was you can talk to your friend about stuff, you can go to the mall all day, you can also hang out with your friend and have a sleep over and watch movies. You don't need to stay on the computer all day; you need to have fun. This is why I say you don't need to be on the computer. You can do other stuff and still learn without being on the computer. For once, maybe instead of talking online you can actually go to your friends house and talk. Thank you for your time. Hope to talk to you soon about this important matter.
214	214	1	3	Dear reader, imagine you're at home and you are on the computer. But its been hours, maybe even days, since you've taken a breath of fresh air outside. This scenario might sound cozy, yet it is a reality for over a large part of the population. Just look around; they are in movies, chain restaurants, at your home, in your office and even in schools; computers are everywhere. I know that because of overusing computers, many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I say that because of this, people everywhere should only be allowed to use the computer on a rainy day, say no to computers otherwise. My point is with computers our days are wasted with virtual games and other downloads. For starters, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Over the past two years obesity has become a major issue with over a significant portion of the population affected; obesity causes an extremely higher risk of getting diseases and sickness like diabetes, heart failure and even depression. Recently my cousin passed away from cancer caused by her fat or obesity. My point is we can't sit here doing nothing; get up and get moving away from that computer. In addition to this, people should get off computers and start enjoying nature. A total of many individuals don't spend enough time outside. With global warming killing our environment, people would care enough to spend a little bit of their time outside. Did you know that more and more of the environment is disappearing each day? I went to my good friend, an expert on all things environmental, from the institute of clean our world, to learn more about this pressing issue.
215	215	1	3	Dear editor, I am expressing my concern to you about the side effects new technologies, such as computers, have on humans. Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much of their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise. People also do not get to spend as much of their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family. Firstly, people are spending too much of their time surfing the net. Studies show that an average person spends in total many hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending on it. Dr. Smith from the technology society says that if this increase in time spent on the internet continues for more years, most people will completely lose contact with family and friends outside of the social computer network. The average weight of a person has increased significantly over the years. Statistics show that the main cause for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the excessive amount of time spent on computers; in addition, people do not have as much time to exercise. Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each. Yet the average adolescent only spends ten minutes a week exercising not including gym. All of these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising. Secondly, computers are affecting the time people get to go outside and enjoy nature. From my personal experience, nature is a beautiful thing to be a part of, but nowadays I spend way too much time on social networks such as Facebook and others. How often do you go outside to take a walk, go for a bike ride or something else? A study done by a researcher shows that the average person has only spent a total of a few days outside in the past two years after receiving their new computer. This must change; people need to enjoy what this world has to offer. Thirdly, computers have affected the interaction between family and friends. An expert noted that people have only been interacting with family at mandatory times such as school meetings. Family and friends are of major importance in everyone's lives. I love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup of hot chocolate. A large percentage of people nowadays do not spend any time with family and many people use computers to interact with friends. It is vitally important that people stop using computers so much because before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends. Computers help people lose communication and interaction with family and friends. In conclusion, I urge you to make the right decision by quitting using computers excessively and in return you will be a much happier and stronger individual. Computers impact humans in a terrible way because people spend too much time on them leading to a lack in exercise, time spent outside, and interaction between friends and family. Thank you for considering my point of view.
216	216	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm writing you today so you can see why advanced technology is a positive effect on people. My reasons for writing this is because computers allow people to talk online to others, people learn about faraway places, and finally it teaches hand-eye coordination. As you read my letter I hope you feel the same way. First of all, computers allow you to talk to other people online. The reason I feel this way is what if you can't find your phone in your house or even your cell phone, you could see if they were online. Also its the same thing as texting, but with a bigger keyboard and screen. I can relate to this because I was texting someone and went online to find them on too, so we sent instant messages to each other instead. I hope you can see why computers can be good for people. Secondly, not a lot of people will go to the library to look up information for a paper for school. The reason I feel this way is a computer has Google to make finding things easier. Another reason is going to the library in @MONTH1 causes you to spend more money to fill up your gas tank. I can relate to this because every time my family goes to the library we have to fill the car up after we go. This is another reason why computers are good. Finally, the computers can teach hand-eye coordination. The reason for this is because if you're writing an email then you should know the keys that your fingers touch. Another reason why computers are good for hand-eye coordination is because if your kid takes karate then they might have learned to move their hands that fast from somewhere. I can relate to this because when I was in the first grade there was a guy that told me and my friends that he needed us to get in the truck to help him find his lost puppy, and he tried grabbing me but I pulled my hand away before I became pinned. I hope you can see why we need computers. I would like to thank you for sitting and reading my essay. Once again my reasons for writing were that people can talk to other people online, learn about faraway places, and finally hand-eye coordination. I hope you will rethink why we should have computers in school.
217	217	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree that computers have a positive effect on people. You learn hand-eye coordination, you don't have to step out to go to the library and it can improve social skills. Continue reading to find out why. Computers, we use them everyday. They are teaching us something. We may @MONTH1 not even realize it, but they are teaching us hand-eye coordination. We type something and we use our eyes to look at the screen and then our hands to type, one mistake and automatically our hand fixes it. Or maybe when we are playing games online, the same thing applies. Our eyes are looking, while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard. Hand-eye Coordination is a skill you need in sports, and I believe that computers, since we spend time on them, are the quick way to learn that skill. Next, how many student's parents work? My parents do. Sometimes it becomes difficult to walk to the library, not everyone lives in walking distance to one. That's when a computer helps. If you have a project to do, but your parents work, you can just look @ORGANIZATION1 it up, you might even get more information than what you can get in the library. How's that? you ask. Well, for an example, say you had to do a project on @CAPS1. Let's just say, you managed to go to a library, but apparently there were only @NUM1 books on @CAPS2, out of which @NUM2 were checked out. You can always check it out from another library, but that might not come soon enough; on a survey @PERCENT1 of students said this has happened to them, but the computer saved them. So what else did they say? HELLO @ORGANIZATION1! Last but not least, a computer improves your social skills. When I first moved here I was a very shy person. When I made a @CAPS3 account, I started talking to people who go to my school. I even became friends with them. I'm not saying that you should just stop talking to people in person, and use @CAPS3, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, or @CAPS8 to communicate. What @CAPS9 I am saying is that if you start talking to them online, you know them a little, then when you talk in person you will see you have a lot in common with that person, and soon you can become friends. Another thing, that is somewhat related to this. I have many friends living in @LOCATION1, and many cousins in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, all over. We all know, you can't travel all the time, sometimes you can't even get to see them. That's where @CAPS10 social networks help. You can keep in touch, plus P.S. you do not even waste minutes on your phone. Can it get better? In conclusion, Computers have a very positive effect on people. From improving hand-eye coordination, to not stepping out to go to the library, and getting that project done in time with an A+ as a grade, to improving your social skills. You can even see the data collected. Thank you for taking your time and effort to read this, I hope it has persuaded many people.
218	218	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 want your kids & citizens to get fat and lazy? Or be active, learn everyday skills and become more friendly to the people around you? @PERCENT1 of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well I think after reading this those extra @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be caused by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn to @CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could get their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage them is to join a sports team or a club. This can work to pull people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. There are great things to do at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike, play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big factor in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up a word tell them to use a dictionary, thesaurus or a book. If people are on the computer but it can teach kids about drugs. But @CAPS1 can help find career options and life. Sitting in front of a screen can hurt your health and also. There are better things to do. Instead of talking via internet, you can still have fun if you are not good at sports, for instance, with friends. If you're a boy you could just go to a place like a park and play career base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since getting up and outside could help you socialize and learn and even lose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you in, if you stay on your computer it can promote the need for glasses and obesity.
219	219	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has lately come to my attention that people were saying that computers aren't important. Well, I strongly disagree with that statement. I think computers teach excellent hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even allow you to chat online with family and friends. Computers teach a lot of hand eye coordination. Study's show that @PERCENT1 of all football players have excellent hand eye coordination. I'm sure this is because after the football players get home from a big game or something they log into @CAPS2 and make their status all about their win. Plus, they probably pull up pinball and see how long they can go without getting the little ball down the hole. Do you have good hand eye coordination? My second reason that I disagree with the previous statement would have to be that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places without ever leaving home. I mean @CAPS1 is so much faster than having to go to the library. At the library you would have to first get there, second pick out your book, and third check it out. With a computer in all that time you could be completely finished with your whole project! Finally, the reason why computers are so important is because @CAPS1 keeps people in touch. Do you have family members who live far away from you? I know I do. I can't always call them on the phone when I want to talk to them so I just log on to @CAPS2 and if they're online I can have my conversation with that person. I don't know about you but I'm really close to my grandma. Unfortunately she doesn't even live anywhere close to me, it's @NUM1 hours away. She's way down in @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2. By car that's one and a half days and by plane that's three hours! So @CAPS1's so much easier to log on to @CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her rather than driving a day and a half or flying for three hours. So in conclusion I'm sure you totally agree with me. Computers are just amazing! They help you get hand eye coordination, let you research something super quick, and let you stay in touch with far away friends and family.
220	220	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Imagine being at home with nothing to do. You cant play basketball with your friends because you have bad hand eye coordination. You want to learn about @LOCATION1, but there arent any books. And you want to talk to your friends. That is what would have happened if we didn't have advances in technology. No hand-eye coordination, we wouldn't be able to learn about far way places and we couldn't chat online. Computers benefit our lives in so many ways. To begin with, hand eye coordination is very important. Without it we wouldn't be able to write or even hold a pencil. @PERCENT1 of people's hand eye coordination has improved when using a computer. That was proven in a @DATE1 study by a @CAPS2 by @PERSON2, head of human reactions. ""We @CAPS3 knows that your hands are the most important part of your body, the computer helps tone down the movements to hone hand eye coordination."" @PERSON1 said that in a @DATE2 interview with science magazine. When you are clumsy you break things. Important things sometimes, like when @PERSON3 in @LOCATION2 broke her mothers glass vase. This could have been helped if she had used a computer. In addition, computers give us the power to learn about faraway places. No books! @PERCENT2 of people prefer looking up information on a computer than in a book. It's a fact. Some people wouldn't have heard about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 if it wasn't for the websites that broadcasted updates on it. Campers wouldn't have heard. The @ORGANIZATION2 had a front page spread to promote the use of computers instead of books. Books could be outdated but the computer will always have up-to-date answers. Also, people need to be able to talk online. Business meetings, government plans, to just chatting with a friend. People need to be able to stay in touch. If the president couldn't video conference he would be flying everywhere. Email is the only way @PERSON5 from @CAPS4 talks to her coworkers. "" I just am located so far away, its so much easier. It makes businesses and major incorporations flow."" ""@CAPS6 is now the only way kids talk, it seems."" @PERSON4 says. It lets them feel like they're a part of something bigger then they are. Now, imagine happy, healthy, and educated young and old Americans. They can do and research whatever they want. Its amazing what technology does. It allows you to talk online, research faraway places, and practice your hand-eye coordination. That sounds like a good thing to me! So @ORGANIZATION1, computers are only good. So agree with me @ORGANIZATION1"
221	221	1	3	Some people think that computers take up too much time for the important things. But really everything you would like to know is right there. You can learn about nature, cool websites, and even history. Here are my reasons on the effect on computers. First, you can learn so much about nature online. You can view many types of animals and study them in detail. Learn about plant life and the profound effect they have on our life. Also, you can learn about many things on the environment and how its changing over time. Secondly, there are many cool websites you can join. There are games you can play to keep you occupied during the day, providing entertainment and mental stimulation. You can even chat online with friends or maybe find long lost friends, reconnecting with people from your past. School sites are available for students seeking some studying or help with their homework. Lastly, computers show you so much about history. You can learn about people who did incredible things and world famous people from back then compared to famous people now. Most important of all, you can discover the life changing story about major events and how they change peoples life today. I hope I've given you enough reasons to agree with me. As you can see computers have many resources you can learn from; learning websites and history arent even half of them. Think about it! Thank you for listening.
222	222	1	3	"Computers and the internet have changed the way the world works today. From stocks to instant messaging, people have based important decisions in their life based on what they have read. Although some people believe that computers are pulling people away from the beauty of nature, relatives, or exercise, I believe that technology is only helping the world on a day to day basis. One example is conversation; many people have close relatives that live over seas, cross country, or even across town. The internet helps them speak to others that they normally couldn't have a conversation with. On several occasions, my family have planned trips together even though we live across the continent. What could have taken months by letters in the mail took as little as one hour to do over the internet. Another way to speak to friends or family is a website called Facebook. Facebook is a website that allows you to speak to, message, or send pictures to others. Other websites like this are Twitter and Instagram. A large percentage of people have an account on one of these websites. One other way to speak to others, more for business reason, is instant messaging. Multiple servers provide instant messaging, such as AOL, Yahoo, or MSN. ""AOL is my personal favorite,"" says a reporter of the local newspaper, ""Technology has helped me endlessly if I need to contact someone on short notice."" That is one reason why I support the use of computers. Another reason I support the use of computers is because a vast majority of all students rely on the internet for research papers and other assignments. ""Even though I still use books,"" a college student said, ""The internet is so much faster and the articles are more up to date."" Search engines are most popularly used, such as Google or Bing. Many computer users with internet access have used Google at some point. Another handy program provided by all computer companies is a word processor. This program is used for everything from research papers to writing letters. This program also has a spell check, a punctuation check, and a grammar check for mistakes. The main reason I am writing this paper is because experts have been complaining that people have been spending too much time on the computer and technology has been distracting them from the important things in life, such as friends, family, and nature. However, from the examples explained in this paper, I have shown that the internet increases conversation and curiosity of how the world looks and operates. As for exercise, it is common sense to spend at least one hour working on personal fitness."
223	223	1	3	I think the way how more and more people use computers are bad because, first, it's not good for people's health, second, people who use computers lots of times, refuse to spend time with family and friends and third, you can find more about something that's on a computer by going and studying it yourself. My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers, is the health issue. Health is very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst. By the way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer screen, or when you hold on the mouse, waiting to click on something for long period of time, can cause arthritis. My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them, is that people who are on computers tend to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends. Like for example, say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get together with the family, and they all count on you to come, but then you get a computer, you go on all these neat websites that you never heard of and it's amazing right! WRONG! Before you know it, it's the day for the family get together and you are online an hour before, and you make an excuse not to come. And that breaks your family's heart. My last reason why, to me computers are a bad idea is you can learn about another culture on the computer by going on to a website. But its more fun traveling or meeting people from that place instead of setting in a chair and having your neck, back and hands get sore, am I right, I think I am. Also it is fun to go and eat foods from the culture that you find cool off that lame computer. (To me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends!) Therefore in conclusion, in my personal opinion computers have bad effects on people health, it can cause later back and neck problems maybe even arthritis. People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends, and you can find more about something like a culture or land, if you go and study it yourself instead of going on a computer for hours. I hope my opinion convinces others, how computers have bad effects on people who use it a lot, and take action into their own hands and do what is right.
224	224	1	3	"Computers have great effects that are positive towards people. This is because it teaches hand eye coordination, allows people to learn about far away places, and to talk to other people online. Computers have great positive effects for everyone. Computers teach hand eye coordination. When a person is typing they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters. Computer games help to teach this skill; in the game things happen very quickly so the person has to see whats going on and click the correct key fast thus improving hand eye coordination greatly. Studies do show that people who use computers have a significantly better hand eye coordination then someone who doesn't. Computers help hand eye coordination and they can teach you about far away places. Someone can learn about far away places by searching it up online. They will get many facts about that place. Sheral from my town said ""I heard some one at school mention a foreign country and didn't know a thing about it so I searched it and got a ton of facts."" This shows the computer can help someone learn about foreign countrys and they can talk to people far away. Using the computer someone could talk to you while your hundreds or thousands of miles away. They can do this through e-mail or video chat. A recent survey showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat because its faster and the two people can see each other. However either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from our city said ""Because of video chat I was able to talk to and see my cousin from another state who I almost never see."" This goes to show that the computer is a positive thing for people. The computer is helpful in so many ways it teaches hand eye coordination, it allows people to learn about far away places and it allows for people to talk to other people. Computers are a great thing for everyone."
225	225	1	3	"Computers, look how far we've come. Computers hold many opportunities for the world and yet we don't use any of them wisely. Computers have taken many people and left them without exercise. Computers fascinate many and can become very addicting if not used only in moderation. Computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family. Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer. You never get up unless you absolutely need to. You even decide to cut the sports from your life. Now imagine what that does to your body. Even if you ate right, the never exercising part would kill you. I remember I was at my cousin's house when she suggested to play the game Wii Fit. If you have never played this before, when you sign in, it does some tests and determines the age of your body. My body was many years older than it should be. I was a young person in an old body. All those years gone in front of the computer. I don't want that experience to happen to another. Don't make the same mistake as me readers. I have a friend, and she is a computer addict. She would spend days on end on the computer. Sometimes she'd miss school for the computer or come to school just to play on the computer. She'd sometimes get violent when someone tried to pull her away. I hated seeing my friend like this, but mostly I hated how I watched it happen. It started off innocent enough. She enjoyed a certain website on the internet. It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night. If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me, you're wrong. I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started. Thankfully, I stopped my addiction before it got too serious, but many others like her could and will be absorbed by the computers. Many readers reading this right now, should understand how dangerous this is. ""Hello!.... Hello!... I'm talking to you!"" That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when you're on the computer. It doesn't work, computers are so attention grabbing, you can't even stand to talk to your own family. My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or instant messaging me. That's really just sad. By doing this you also become detached which is never a good thing. The more and more you ignore your family for the computer the less of a bond you'll have, the less of a life you'll have. Computers truly are amazing, but the loss of exercise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening. Computers can also be dangerous, many people will get addicted. The more you chat on chat room to strangers, the less you will talk to your family. Computers are dangerous tools if misused. They will most certainly destroy you if you are not careful, readers. Always be careful, computers are not as they seem."
226	226	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 out of ten people spend their time on the computers. I believe people should not spend @CAPS3 much time on their computers because it can hurt their eyes. They @MONTH1 watch inappropriate videos or pictures. Lastly, their bills will get higher. Did you know a lot of people spend their time on the computers? Well I think they should not be sitting on their computers and damage their eyes. When you sit and watch the computer screen for a long time, your eyes starts to hurt and get strained. Then when you go to check your eyes, the doctor will probably give you glasses. My second reason is that people go to inappropriate sites and watch inappropriate videos. One time my friend was sitting in the computer and she started to watch inappropriate videos @CAPS3 when her father found out about this, he canceled their internet. Can you imagine the high bills you would get from using so much electricity and internet data? Why pay too much money for spending @CAPS3 much time in the computer, when you can turn off the computer and spend some time with your friends. For example, instead of sitting on the computer @CAPS3 much, go outside and play soccer, kickball and more. In conclusion, people should stop spending @CAPS3 much time on the computers. Computers can hurt your eyes if you sit too much. People @MONTH1 watch inappropriate videos. Also your bills will get higher. It seems to me that people need different activities to get them off the computers. I hope you are agree with my ideas.
227	227	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a good thing to have for the following three reasons. First, they help people learn by looking up information on different places. Second, they help people talk to friends and family using @CAPS2. Lastly they help people become less stressed by playing computers games. Learning is important and with computers, you're able to learn faster. Computers help you learn about faraway places like @LOCATION1. It is much easier to learn on the computer than to go to the library and check out a book. If you're working on a project and you needed some last minute information, you could just go to the computer and search your topic. Learning on a computer is much more convenient then going to the @CAPS1. Another reason computers are good is because you can talk to friends and family who are far away using something called @CAPS2. @CAPS2 allows someone to talk to another person using the computer. These people could live just down the block or half-way across the world. My cousin is living in spain for a semester in college. I've skyped with her many times. The cool thing about @CAPS2 is that you can actually see the person you're talking to on the computer screen. @CAPS2 is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends who are faraway. My last reason is that computers help lower your stress level by playing games. Computer games are a lot of fun to play. They have games that range from @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the word, to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 beauty barn. Computer games are a great way to lower your stress because instead of picking your self up with too much work, you'll be calming your self down with computer games. They also have educational games. like, Which country is which. This game teaches you geography while you have fun. Computers are a great thing to have. They help you learn about faraway places, talk to people who live faraway and play fun computer games. Computers are always going to be used and never put to waste. Theres always something you can do when you go on a computer.
228	228	1	3	Dear people from the newspaper, I am concerned that people take too much time on the computer because it could cause trouble, violence, & illegal crimes. First, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it causes trouble, in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people in the @LOCATION1, do bad stuff like starting rumors, & saying bad stuff about people they despise, in the @DATE1, @PERCENT2 @DATE1 teens form ages @NUM1 were involved with the rumor spreading. This would be bad for all children. All these reasons will lead to the @NUM2 below. Secondly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it causes violence, because @DATE1 the reasons started in the @NUM3 paragraph, if all this continues, then it @MONTH1 & lead to violence, in @DATE1 @NUM4 people died from all the crimes online. @NUM5 threats were found online from big websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2 & @CAPS3. Lastly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it could lead to illegal crimes, In @DATE3 a girl was talking to a boy online then when they decided to meet, he shot & killed her. It turned out he was just a person who lied about who he was online, @CAPS4 on a website online, a group @DATE1 men were talking about how much they hated kids so they decided to shot them @ their bus stops. Thank god that the police caught them before they were to do the crime In conclusion, I am concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer because it causes trouble, violence, & illegal crimes. This @CAPS5 like totally needs to stop before everyone is addicted to spreading rumors. Thank you for your time in reading this letter.
229	229	1	3	Dear Readers, Everyone now-a-days has a computer. This could be a good thing but mostly its unnatural. People can now do things they couldn't do before; when people move they don't need to send letters to one another, and have to wait days for a reply. Now they just sign into aim, facebook, or myspace. Then they can talk in real time. But thats only the good things here are the bad. People spend less time outside they don't look at any of the beauty anymore. We don't spend time with our friends any more. I can't even remember the last time I had a face to face conversation with someone if I didn't have to. People on the internet can do anything they want. You @MONTH1 be saying thats a good thing. Right? Well the answer is no! People can hack into almost everything. People can cyber bully others with out any one ever knowing who the other person is. People can also be any one they want online. Say if I was @NUM1 and I wanted to stalk some little @NUM2 years old I could also pretend that I was ten and pretend make friends with the ten year old. When I found out enough information I would then be able to find the ten year old. Before people weren't able to do this. If people start to see what is happening with our existence the more people would stop being attached @NUM3 to their computers. People would start to cut down on the amount of time they spend on their computers and start to live. Take action! Take notice! Start spreading the word!
230	230	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 would you want to do in your spare time? Would you go outside and maybe @CAPS3 the soccer ball around with your kids, or grab a bag of chips and log onto facebook or your email? The question is, do computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers have a negative effect. Talking to friends on the computer doesn't let you learn social skills. Going on the computer can also be very addicting. Finally, it take's away from all the exercise you need. I @CAPS4 that after careful consideration you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people. Facebook, ichat and email are all fun and easy ways to talk to your friends and family online. However, are you really gaining any social skills by doing this? Talking to friends and family online doesn't help you have good social skills. When you first meet someone in person, you most likely want to @CAPS4 @CAPS2 to say and how to act. Typing on a keyboard doesn't really let you interact with people. @CAPS6 not invite someone over, or go out to lunch with your family instead? Computers also are very addicting. I can say for myself that once I log onto the computer, I might not be off for the next hours. This is the case for many other people too. Going on the computer is addicting. I'll @CAPS4 that not everyone is using a computer on a daily basis the vast majority of people are. When I'm on facebook and I see the number of people online is one hundred or even two hundred, as time goes by, the number increases. The computer being addicting leads to not getting enough exercise. Doctors say that adults and kids should get atleast an hour of exercise a day. Going on the computer takes away from this time. Instead of sitting on the computer for an hour, you could be getting your hour of exercise. instead A lot of times when someone @CAPS5 down at the computer, a snack goes with them. This just adds onto the fact @CAPS6 getting the exercise is important to stay healthy. I @CAPS4 that I would feel a lot better if I went for a run instead of going on the computer. You are probably saying that you have time to manage both, but some people would rather exercise. When these people see you on the computer, @CAPS2 kind of example does it set? If everyone limited their time on the computer we would all feel a lot better and be more social. I trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people.
231	231	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people find the clicking and clacking of computers a nuscense. What they don't realize is thay are helping the youths lives and making them easier and they could be doing the same for them. This is why computers have a very good effect on people. First off computers arn't a bad thing if they are just helping people get to know each other better. You always see ad's for dating websites and other things like that. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of couples meet online. Thats a lot and to think they would have never if it wern't for computers, which connect hearts across distances. Second of all computers provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. There are over @NUM1 on computer games online. @CAPS2 of them are free too. I bet almost every kids has played a game on the internet before. Think about it your child could be out getting in trouble or be nice and safe at home playing on the computer. You are probably thinking, computers sound so childish and infantile. Well computers arn't just fun and games. They provide a lot of information. They are very useful for teens in school for projects, but they benefit adults in many ways too. It provides information on vacations, hotels, ext. Also computers now have videos all over on how to do things like how to fix a sink and other useful information. So as you can see computers arn't just a pain. They help bring people together, provide entertainment and have very useful information. Think about it. A computer might save your life one day by providing critical instructions in an emergency. Computers help peoples every day lives and they could be helping yours.
232	232	1	3	"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world."

234	234	1	3	Many people think that computers are not a good thing. They think people spend to much time on the computer and are getting less exercise. They are also concerned that looking at the screen could be damaging to your eyes. Those statements maybe true. I believe that computers are beneficial. You can talk to people from other places. You could learn about other places in the world. You can also use the computer to research topics. first off, on the computer you can talk to people. Whether it on a webcam or one of those networks to @LOCATION1 and chat with each other. On the computer you can chat and talk with people without having to be on the phone and paying a bill for it. For example, I have family in another country and one way we always talk is on the computer. We talk on webcam and chat. Calling someone from another country on the phone gets really expensive. If I didn't have a computer then I would not have that great of contact with @CAPS2 family from another country. In addition, You can use the computer to look at foreign countries. Many people including @CAPS2 parents have used the computer to look and read into about other countries. @CAPS2 mother, whenever @CAPS1 plans a vacation, looks up the country we are going to and gets more information about it. Like @DATE1 we went to a hot exotic place, @CAPS2 mom looked it up to see what we should pack to go there. If it weren't for the computer we might have packed the wrong items. Lastly, computers are a great source for researching. I can't tell you how many times I have used the computer to research. Books and encyclopedias are great sources but the computer has so much to offer. You have so many links you can go to and sites. You can find pictures, videos, maps, and much more. I have used the computer many times to research, sometimes its a requirement to have a few sites you have gone on to research for your project in school or something. If you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school. Computers are a more positive thing than negative. You can talk to people without the expensive phone bill. You can learn about other places and cultures. Also, you can use it for researching purposes. Computers @CAPS3 are an essential tool in our modern world!
235	235	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I feel that computers are a great in most people lives. One you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you in many ways. It shouldnt affect dailey schedule or just being with your family. People can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer. For example, you can play games all different kinds, you can also chat with people, litsen to music, watch videos, look for places and a whole lot more. Computers are very useful in many different ways. Computers are also good for you. They help with you eye cordination. You can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. The internet also has a lot of eduacting games whiten is good for people who had that extra help. It also helps you with you hand cordinations because on the computer you need to know how to type. you get realy good at it you can type without looking. A computer can not get between you dailey schedule or whay u do with your family. Because a computer is a computer you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun for example i havea computer at my house and someone goes on it everyday and it never affect what everybody does us kids still go to school my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. As my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses. One you can use them for almost everything. Two computers are good for you. Three i shouldnt affect your daily schedule in anyway, making them a helpful addition to any home.
236	236	1	3	Dear newspaper people, I think computers are good because what if I have a family member that goes out of town and I want to stay in touch and I don't have a phone; then I can go on a chatting website and stay in touch with them. When I am bored I go on Google to look up pictures and play some games. You can look up one thing and find something else, but it will catch your eyes. Computers are good wherever you go; it can look up a project for school. But when you are in school it can help you with spelling, and if you got to know what country has the most people the computer will find the answer as fast as a snap. Computers are advancing every year. At the start, the computer was just a screen and a mouse, but now we have laptops that you can take everywhere. People can get exercise if they want and they can enjoy nature; they can bring a laptop. But when you are exercising then you can go right to YouTube and listen to some music and watch funny videos. And that is why I think computers are good for many different reasons in our daily lives.
237	237	1	3	Dear Editors and Readers, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. And there are three of them: identity theft, cyberbullying, and addiction. Now I will write one paragraph about each. My first reason why I feel that computers have bad effects is identity theft. Many people in the U.S.A. have their identities get stolen for listing private information online using a computer, which can leave that person in a lot of debt. How are we going to encourage people to use computers when they are at the risk of getting their identity stolen? If this is happening to innocent people it needs to stop; we must not encourage this online behavior, so say no to computers. I understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries, but there are some cons. Talking online to people you don't know and have never seen or met in person is risky; they can pose as someone famous and bully you for their enjoyment. It has been proven that when children, and even adults, get cyberbullied it can lead them down the path of depression and even suicide. Now I find it quite feeble-minded to give up your life for a computer, so again I say no to computers. My last reason why I say no to computers is because people become addicted to the excitement of the computers, which eventually leads to division from friends and family because you are lost in the computer world; also you forget about your hygiene and some people even forget to eat. This thing they call a computer is a drug, a drug that makes you forget about reality and everything else you used to think of and brings you to computer land. And I say no to computers. I have given you my opinion and three supporting reasons why I feel the way I do, which were because of identity theft, cyberbullying, and addiction. We should say no to computers for the good of our society.
238	238	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly agree with experts on computers. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They say that computers teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn from faraway places, and even allow people to talk with others online. These effects are true but there are many other bad effects that they do not like to say. Computers also affect people's vision as you are really close to the screen; computers are really addicting for many people all around the world and having them do barely any exercise is moving many people toward a big problem nowadays, which is obesity. Computers also tend to take a lot of time away from people's lives. The way I see it is that although computers have some positive effects on people, you can achieve those positive effects in a better way that can keep you fit too and let you see places with your own eyes. For example, you can get practice with hand-eye coordination by simply getting a friend and passing tennis balls back and forth quickly, so at the same time you are exercising too. Also, a computer can have you talk with your friends online, but why not talk to them by phone if they are far away and then go outside to catch some fresh air? And if they live close by, why not talk to them in person instead? Or if you want to learn about a certain faraway place, why not visit the place instead? There are many things you can do that a computer can do, but better. But yet I am not saying a computer is all bad at all. I agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers, as well as most things in the world we live in. In my opinion, I honestly think there are more bad effects than good effects for computers when you consider the overall impact on our health and daily lives.
239	239	1	3	I personally think that people should not spend so much time on the computer. One reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because they spend too much time on them and not enough time exercising. Another reason why is because people aren't enjoying nature. Finally, my last reason is because people are spending less time interacting with family and friends. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending more time on them than exercising. People will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer. People should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer. Even if you have your own equipment at your house to exercise on, it's still better than going on the computer and not getting any exercise at all. If people spent as much time exercising as they spend on the computer, then the average weight of a human would go way down. Another reason people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time enjoying nature. People should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day. I personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit than being inside on the computer getting fat. Even if you look at nature via computer, it still won't be the same because you actually aren't outside experiencing it yourself. If people would spend as much time enjoying nature as they are on the computer, we would be living in a much more healthy and clean world. My last reason why I think people spend too much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends. People could be in a dark room all day, isolated from everyone they care about, just because they are on the computer. That to me just isn't right because they are avoiding spending quality time with their friends and family; instead, they are spending time with their computer. If a person spends all their time on the computer then everyone they care about will gradually be slipping away, even if they don't know it. So as you can see, it would be much better if people spent more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends than spending more time on the computer. Even if you don't spend a lot of your time on the computer yet, you will gradually spend more and more time on it every day until eventually it's all you do, which is why we must be cautious now.
240	240	1	3	Dear Editor, This is a letter telling you my opinion about computers. Yes, people do spend a lot of time on computers, and it is because computers are very helpful in many ways. Computers help us with our job, school, work, etc. For example, in science class: I am in fifth grade and my teacher gives us homework; every Monday, we have to do an assignment where we find facts about anything you want to write about. A lot of people look up bears online and they do their assignment about bears. For jobs, secretaries always have to use the computer for everything; in our school, secretaries and teachers use computers for attendance and grading. They check your attendance, grades, phone number, and schedule. For communication, my dad uses the computer to talk with our family from another state. We talk to know how they've been and to know what is new. Like a week ago, I was chatting with my cousin and she told me her dog had three puppies. My family also uses the computer to order things. My uncle went to a ticket website and he ordered two tickets for a show. He also orders his flight tickets on his computer to go visit our family. Well, my point is people use computers a lot because they are very helpful in many ways. It is not good to just be on the computer; it is good to go outside, enjoy nature, live your life, and exercise not only to be in shape but for your health. I hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers. Thank you for taking your time and reading this; I really appreciate it and hope it provides a clear perspective.
241	241	1	3	Dear local @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, lately I have been noticing that some of the citizens of @ORGANIZATION1 have been using computers and laptops for a good amount of time. To some people, they say @CAPS2 is a waste of time they could be enjoying with family and friends. However, @CAPS2 helps with research and learning @ORGANIZATION1 things, and @CAPS2 helps with relaxing people in modern times. Some family and friends live far away and you can't talk to them in person. There is always calling them or writing them a letter, but email, Facebook, and @ORGANIZATION2 are easier and faster to use. When you call, you don't know if they are there, their phones are busy, or they have a bad connection. @CAPS2 is better to stay connected and send a message, knowing you didn't interrupt them. Furthermore, @CAPS2 helps in advertisement and sales for local businesses. Sometimes information online can be unreliable because anybody can change anything on a site. Not all things online are like that though; you should stay away from scams and suspicious things, as they will try to trick you. Some people find the internet @CAPS2 could be distracting from work or lead to time-wasting sites. However, there are fun games and ways to talk to people that help you relax. In research, the internet helps @PERCENT1 of people relax and calm down after a long @CAPS5, when on the computer or laptop, which helps with stress. Computers can help in many ways, and there are other reliable things online to use. Plus, wherever you go you will find the internet useful for staying informed and connected.
242	242	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people online. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person, and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise should be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attached to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. @CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make Facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 accounts. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways, which can lead to misunderstandings. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate without waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and wants them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interesting and everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people online? Go and talk to them in real life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life and enjoying activities your town offers is the way to go for a healthier and more connected community. Thank you for your concern."
243	243	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would life affect you if you did not have a computer? I strongly believe that computers have a great effect on people all around the world. It helps you at work for a job and at school. Computers also help students and adults talk to people. Many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is. With a computer, you can find out all of that information. Read into the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic. With a computer it is much easier at your job or at school. Just think, without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours. When you type a paper for school, you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct. If you write a paper by hand, there is a huge chance that some words could be spelt wrong. Work gets finished a lot quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends. If you rush on a paper, the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says, but on the computer, your work is always going to be neat. You can email your work to a friend or save it to your computer so if you need to change something for a paper, it will be quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over. Computers do not affect me in a horrible way because it helps me get my work done faster. Computers help people communicate with other people. By having a computer people can talk to other people easily. In many schools students ask their friend a question about homework. Without a computer, people would have no way of asking questions and might end up getting it wrong. I like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans. When you are on the computer, you can go on Facebook and if they are on, talk to them about what they wanted to do that night. It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them. Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with. Now with a computer they will have no issue doing that. You will finally be able to look up a place you want to go. Many people in this world like to travel; on the computer you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place you want to go, you will see if there is an easy way to get there and that might not be by car. I would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching. Now I can just go on the website and find out everything I wanted to know about that place. If a place is @NUM1 hours away, I would not want to travel that far so I would need to know if a place is close to where I live; computers really tell you a lot about it and what the weather is mostly like. I use the computer for mostly everything I do. Coming through our minds have showed you what we have thought about the effects computers have on us today. We can make work a lot easier, talk to other people, and get information on places you want to visit or somebody you want to see. The computer is a very reliable source for me and you have lost a lot if you do not agree with me on this important tool for modern life.
244	244	1	3	Dear @CITY1 current, I am writing to you on the issue about people spending too much time on computers and not being able to spend time with other people like family, friends and others. Also people are getting information off of the computer which is a good thing for important papers that you might have to do or a college essay to get into that college. Another reason is that people are turning a bit lazy and not getting to enjoy exercising and getting some fresh air. To move on, I will explain what I mean about being with family and friends. For example, let's say that your friends are planning on going to this huge beach party that everyone is going to. So you tell your friends to pick you up but before they come you go on the computer to talk to someone you know and your friends come to your house to pick you up but you are not ready for them so they pass on by and you don't go. You go to school the next day and they are talking about how you missed the party. So that is my story; it might seem long so I'm shortening the next part which is the information on the computer. For example, let's say that you are doing a paper and you just need more information. You find a place to go online, find good information, write it down, get off of the computer, finish your paper, get a good grade, feel happy, the end. So that is the only good end of the reason why computers are good. For some reason, some people want to stay inside on the computer but others go outside on a good warm day. So what is your reason: Myspace, Facebook, other? It's good if you talk to other people, but bad if all you are worried about is if your pics are good; what matters is that you need to be happy. I think I have done all I could. So those are my reasons why computers are good for research but bad because of no time to exercise and the need to be with friends in person.
245	245	1	3	I believe computers are a benefit to society. Computers help hand-eye coordination; they make it easy to learn about different places and allow people to talk and video chat. Computers teach hand-eye coordination when typing and eventually you get so good you don't ever have to look down at the keyboard. You can search for anything on the internet and if you want to learn about a country you can search it and find out all new things you never knew before. Maybe you want to go on vacation to another country and can't decide which country to go to; you can go on the computer and look up tourist attractions in those countries to decide which area you want to go to. If you have family on vacation or living in a different place from you and want to see them, you can video chat with them over the computer. Those are the reasons why I think that computers are a benefit to our society, helping us learn, connect, and explore the world from our own homes.
246	246	1	3	"Dear editor, Have you ever wanted to know something so badly that you can't focus on anything else? Have you ever tried to find that information and had an ""ah-hah!"" moment? What did you use to search for this knowledge? You probably used a computer. All you need to do is type in your request, hit ""enter"" and viola! Your screen fills with choices of information sites. Computers help so many people with everyday questions. Our country has gotten smarter because of computers. You can converse with friends that have moved across the state, country, or even world. At every click of your mouse there are new things to learn. You can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment. Computers have opened up so many opportunities the world needs to take. When I was four years old, my best friends at the time moved to Florida. I was devastated. At first, we tried writing letters to each other. Then, as we grew older and became busier and busier, our connection with each other halted. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I text, e-mail, and instant message each other all the time. It has made our long distance friendship easier and closer. Because of computers, you can communicate with friends you thought were long-lost. You can also meet new people with one of the many social sites available. How would you like to talk with someone all the way down in Australia? World communication has also opened up many business opportunities. Since the economy is failing, computers will open job spaces, help college students study for their future career, and hopefully help to improve the lives of many people. Communication is needed for many things to make our world better for generations to come. Instead of going to a noisy arcade, why not play exciting games right in the privacy of your home. Any game you can think of can probably be found on the internet. From a simple game of solitaire to an advanced level of strategy, games for any age and difficulty level can be found. Now, some people think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There are going to be some people that will refuse to go outside, spend time with their friends or just read a book. There will definitely be some people like that. I can't help it. What we can do is allow all those that refuse to go outside to do so. I know many people who spend and budget their time wisely and still have a great time. We can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are many fun games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun. The computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in you would be overwhelmed. Google, a popular search engine, gives you the power to look up anything you could ever want to know from the vice president's birthday to the price of eggs in China to how wide the Amazon River is can all be found with the click of a button. This knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly. Most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently, you have all the facts all the time. I think our country has gotten much smarter because of computers. So whether you want to talk to your long-lost friend in Australia or talk to an expert on osprey in Alaska, you can find your answer on the computer. While you're at it, play a couple exciting games and learn about the best movies ever released in the last decade. Have fun and learn lots!"
247	247	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, Many people are now using computers. However, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about them. Some people don't like them, and then there's people like me who do like them. Computers can let you communicate faster, you can play all sorts of games for entertainment, and it provides vast information. Nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them. Unlike sending and writing letters to people, instant messaging is a much faster and easier way to talk to another person. Sending and receiving letters can take days or weeks, on the other hand, instant messaging takes only a few seconds! Even better, it's free! Instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family, there is also video chat. Video chat is just like talking on the phone but you can also see the person you're talking to. You can be talking on video chat with someone from another country, and guess what? It's also free! When you make long distant calls, it can be very costly, but video chat won't cost a penny out of your pockets! Not only is a computer good for communication, but you can also play fun and entertaining games! Everyone enjoys playing games, whether you're one or eighty-two. There are countless websites on the internet and among them there are game sites. Most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for free! There's one player, two player, and party games. This means you could play alone, with a friend, or the whole family. Everyone can join in and have a great time. Also, computers could be used for fun and they can be used for work. The internet holds endless information. It's like your own personal library at home at a touch of a finger! Whether you're doing research on a project, looking up a fact, or just want to be informed, the internet can help you with any subject. All you have to do is search the topic you need whether it's cooking a certain dish, learning about space, trying to spell a word, or anything you can think of, and it'll all be there for you, and once again, for free! In conclusion, computers are useful for many things and these are just a few examples. I hope you think of computers the way I, and millions of other people, do. As you can see, computers have improved the lives of many human beings.
248	248	1	3	Dear School Board, Computers are a new technology that keeps on getting better and better. They can do many things like help you learn something new and see new or old friends. Even some people do online education. Also what a lot of people like about computers is the games. Computers are a great benefit to us and can be useful and fun. The computer can teach us many new and exciting things. There can be a lot to learn too. Somethings you could learn about on the computer are places, people, animals, plants, food, etc. I have once had to find a recipe for caramel apples and to do so I used the computer. Some people use the computer for their education. There are online college and online high school. It's like a new way to be home schooled. Not everyone can go to big universities so it is easier for them to use an online college. Also, lets say you're doing a project and you need information; instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it. There are many other things you can do on the computer like visit with some friends. I have friends, everyone has friends either new friends or old friends. Back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter. With a computer you can now send a letter faster then before. It's now called an email. You just type what you want and click send it off to your friend. Not all use an email, some use instant messaging. An example of that would be AIM or Meebo. I moved from Ohio to here and I have friends I don't get to see much. I bet there are many people that have that same issue. Well with the computer you can now see people! You can video chat and see them. For instance Skype is a way to see your friends like that. It's an easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even your family. There is still more that a computer can do. Another thing it can do is play video games. They are so much fun to play and what I am talking about is video games. Kids love them, even teens and adults love them. Whenever you're bored you can go play online games. Or you can have games you purchased and play them. They are entertaining and fun too! Even very little kids can play games. Sometimes you can even play with your friends online with an online game. I know when I get bored I go on the computer and play a game called Minecraft. Computers are great and there are plenty of more things you can do other than what I was talking about. I hope I have convinced you or showed you how computers are a benefit to us people.
249	249	1	3	"According to Dr. Evans, an economic expert, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by a few cents. The average teenager spends several hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community loss because you won't spend as much time with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent one less hour on the computer, they could save money off their electric bill. In a survey, seven out of ten people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots of money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how Americans are becoming obese. Part of this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Professor Smith from the National Health Institute says that, ""the obesity in America is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" Currently, a significant number of people are obese. If everyone spent one less hour on the computer, it would become a smaller number. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to each other face to face anymore. They all talk on social media or through text messages. Communities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. Dr. Evans, an expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, they spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provide financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the computer."
250	250	1	3	I do not believe computers benefit society. Many people spend their life on their computer instead of exercising, going out with friends, or spending time with family. A majority of teenagers will agree they spend at least several hours a day on their computer, which is unnecessary. Why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays? Because of a lack of exercise. And who is the number one culprit? Computers of course. In order for more people to maintain health, there needs to be a lot of physical activity. When someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys in, how much exercise are they really getting? Plus, there are many different disorders in the world. A large percentage of individuals will agree that with more exercise, these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided. Too many people are choosing their computer over exercise and it causes them many health problems that could've easily been avoided. Secondly, everyone would agree that friends are essential in life. But now people are talking to their friends online or in computer games instead of going to see them. Online there is much more drama which often breaks up friendships. Also, online you cannot meet new people or make as many new friends as you can in person. In real life you go out and have many more friends, which makes life in general much better. Finally, you wouldn't want families to become distant, would you? Well, this is one of the many effects when the members of a family do not get together which could weaken them as a family. Plus, husbands and wives could not talk very often, often leading to separation or divorce. This could make a child have to decide between parents. Exercise, friends, and family are essential in life, and computers put those in jeopardy. So take a stand and end this reign for good, stop the overuse of computers before it is too late.
251	251	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend too much time on computers when they could be exercising or with friends and family. I, on the other hand, think otherwise. Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others, here's why: @CAPS3 of all, I would like to say how much computers help us in school. Most students use them every day. We can study for tests by looking for websites with lots of information and we can also research topics that we don't understand. For example, if you want to find out how planets form, you can just type it into a search engine and a list of websites will pop up. Another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects. We can use different tools to set up a slide show while also looking up information on the internet. We can add pictures and videos to make the presentation more engaging and informative. Lastly, the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students. If the teacher sets up a blog, students can always see what the class is doing, what the homework is, and find cool links that will help them understand certain topics better. Another point I would like to mention is that the experts say that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is, its the opposite, computers actually take communication to a whole new level. For example, if you wanted to have a chat with an old friend, you could log right on to msn or aim and find out what's new in their lives. A second way to communicate with friend is by @ORGANIZATION1, a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country. Next, you could go a bit more old fashioned and just write an e-mail. It will take longer to get a reply but its still worth the wait in the end. Lastly for parents who kids live far away, video chat is also a good way to communicate because you will be able to see them and hear their voice as well. Lastly, I would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer. You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you're bound to finds hundreds of results. It doesn't matter what your interests are because you'll always find great information. The internet also allows you to catch up on recent news such as weather. Next, there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast. You might have to check your sources to make sure they're reliable, but I believe it's still worth it. Lastly, if you are getting ready to go on a trip, you can check flight information with the click of a button. Or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like, there are many websites for that. There are also websites that can help you learn about the place you'll be staying at as well, including local attractions and restaurant reviews. Next time, think twice about what you hear about computers because they really aren't all that bad for you. Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better to go outside and play but computers do help you learn and communicate with others which are just as important.
252	252	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I also agree that computers have a positive effect on people. I agree with this because the computer can teach people things. Also people can talk to each other, and believe / create whatever they want. Computer have a positive effect on people because i believe the computer can teach people a lot. The computer can make things visual to kids and out. I know that when i was younger i used to play math and science games on the computer to help me study for tests. The computer also helps out with adults and their jobs. I don't know what half the adults in the world would do without computers. If you think about all jobs that are happening today also @CAPS1 of the computer. Such as e-mail. What would some buisnesses do without e-mail? also adults like to check websites for the news and to catch upon sports. we can all learn so much from the computer and there are so many people who @CAPS1 their jobs on computer. we all learn something everyday and with the computer, we can make it kind. Also the computer benefits online chats e-mail and now even with a cam you can talk face to face with people all over the world I know e-mail helps out so many people who live long distance and e-mail doesn't take long at all. I know thanks to cam and microphones that are buit into computer helped our because now I can talk to all my friends and family and see them I hear them without traveling just simply clicking a button. There are websites now that @CAPS1 of taveing to @NUM1 people online and over cam or microphone. Things like this help out so much somepeople just. Think about all those people who have relationships and what not, @CAPS1 it off of computers really do help out. Lastly all the people who @CAPS1 their imagination off computers, all those people who put that thoughts and feelings into the computer. I know plenty of people who type their feeling because they would never dare say them a loud. They can express themselves through writing or digital art, finding a creative outlet they might not have otherwise. Now imagine if computers faded away? That's what i think about what people say such things as the computers not. Everything is useful and everything has at least some sort of positive effect coming out or it. So @CAPS2 in my opinion computers do bring out a positive effect to the world.
253	253	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computer's are good to use? More and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits soceiety I srong disagree. My first reason is because computer's are not safe. My second reason is computer's could get you in a lot of troble. My @CAPS3 reason is you never know what could happen on the computer. Read on and see why I disagree. First @CAPS4 gonna tell you why I disagree. The reason why I disagree is because computer's are not safe because you could have someone trace where you live at then what? Second - computer's could get you into a lot of trobe such as posting things online or saying mean thing's to people. Next computer's are bad because if someone like's you and you say I dont like you they could post mean and hurt full thing's and then if you friend's see it you will probably get mad. This can lead to serious arguments and even cyberbullying, which is a big problem. Finally - in concusion thease are all my reason's why I think computer's are not good. You never know what coud happen on a computer there's website's there and some could start a virus on your computer. Also I think computer's are not good because computer's lead to no good so keep your child away from computers. Also be careful what chu @CAPS2 because it could have negative consequences for you and your family.
254	254	1	3	I walked into my living room. I saw my brother on the computer talking to his friends on facebook. I thought to my self he's always on the computer never for any school reason. People always says we don't need computers I personaly agree with the statement. In the town @ORGANIZATION1 everybody mostly has computers. Without a computer to look up for content things, you have to go to the library and check out a bank. Just the other @DATE1 my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culter. He loved that book he read it @DATE1 in and @DATE1 out, he read it for a book report on different culters. When he handed it into the teacher the @DATE1, when he reached the classroom the teacher looked @CAPS2 happy when she gave him back his test he had an @NUM1. He didn't use the internet your computers not mobile like a book if you wanted to learn about something while your traveling in you car you can't plug your computer in and use it unlike a book. Also books are usually funnier to read. Not haveing a computer can conclude to a lot more things like exercising. While my brother is inside all @DATE1 me and my friends are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kirkball, and dogeball. We are very thin because @CAPS3 what we do almost every @DATE1. Unlike my brother were he is obeast because @CAPS3 all he done were before he had the computer he was as thin as us. It is also unhealth to be on the computer all @DATE1 because that can lead to staying update at night, don lead to missing the bus, and also lead to bad grades. Where when we are done with are gaine we whatch a little t.v.. then go to sleep to regain our energy we usually have atleast @NUM2 hrs. of sleep ever @DATE1 which lets us make it through school. We also make the right choses in food to eat to have more energy such as fruit and vegitibales. Were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity. Not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family. When we go out to eat my brother is always in a push to get back on to the computer dosen't let us enjoy our food. He usually is @CAPS2 much in a rush he picks off of other people's @CAPS2 they would be finished faster, when every one wants to enjoy then food. When we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer. Even if we buy a movie and whatch it at home he won't whatch it with us he's on the computer. It really makes my mom, dad, brothers, and sisters mad that he won't do any thing but play on the computer. Even when are whole family gose out side to play a sport he won't come out and play. It's like he's not part of the familiy anymore. Its like he forgot we were even @CAPS3 the reason why I think computes should be in the state of @LOCATION1. If can lead to and relly bad grades. @CAPS2 if you want your kids healthier, better grades, and spend more time with your family then ethier sell your computer or This is happening all over the world and it is important to recognize the negative impact.
255	255	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a great advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with @NUM1 reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even let you do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them. Most of them are free to create an account so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for them. So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting. Computers even have webcams for video chat. With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time, thats amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research. If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask.com. You can easily find the details and information you need. All this takes is just a couple minutes, which is alot better than reading for an hour or time. You can find articles, encyclopedias, and even videos on almost any subject. Lastly, if you really want something or need it just shop online. For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but its not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet. They even ship your item fast. I like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday. In conclusion, computers are very handy. If you need information, talk to someone, or buy something its got it. I use computers a lot. I think they are very great to have and they make many parts of life much easier.
256	256	1	3	Some of you will agree that computers don't keep you fit or that we spend too much time on them, but they can help you keep in touch with friends and family, meet new people, and save important information. Without these essential technology devices, we wouldn't be able to do any of these things conveniently. Most families live all over the country or even in another country, and you don't get to see them very often because of high traveling prices; however, with the computer, we can keep in contact with them very easily and quicker than you can say the name of a distant location. Many more people are making websites that allow us to easily keep up with our distant family. Facebook, various social networks, online communities, and dating sites are all platforms where you can find friends or the one that's right for you. This gives you a chance to discover many people with the same interests as you. Half of my mom's boyfriends were from these sites. Without these sites, there might be fewer divorces and more happy-ending fairy tales. A significant number of people work out from home, which is good because you can get things done efficiently. Many people have papers full of important information that could be lost in the blink of an eye. With this technology, they can save everything with just a click of the mouse. More businesses are being run from households because of this easy-going technology. Exercise remains important, but with a touch of a button, I could talk to my aunt, find the right person for me, and save my whole life's work. New technology like computers can change the world and help us accomplish things faster and more effectively, making our lives more connected and organized.
257	257	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, My opinion on the fact of the computer is that it can be bad for the citizens in our town and in the wider region. I think that some people are not getting enough exercise, and I also think that you can get lazy; the computer is bad too. My three reasons for my opinion are as follows. People are not getting enough exercise, people get lazy and change while being on the computer a significant amount of time, and they will get addicted to the computer. The first reason is because people are not getting enough exercise. I pick that reason because people I know gain a lot of weight, and it's kind of sad because they do nothing but stay on the computer and eat. Another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen for extended periods. One time I did that, and my eyes felt weird and strained after getting off the computer. The third detail was that people become very fragile and weak. I picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and try to exercise, your bones will feel weak from lack of use. The second reason is because people will become lazy and change; for an example, people will keep asking you to get stuff and do stuff for them, and you would do it because you are a good friend. The second detail is that the person will change; the person will be too lazy to go to fun events with you as a friend. The next thing you know, you won't have a friend anymore. The third detail is that it's like your best friend has replaced you for a computer; that hurts. If a person you know for a long time has replaced you for a computer, that's something that will make you depressed and make you wanna commit suicide, to me anyway. The third reason is because the person will get addicted to the computer; for an example, you want to celebrate a birthday and the person says, ""first I got to beat this level."" This shows that the person is not going to get off the computer. Another detail is that their day will go pass fast, and that's like wasting days of life; people who died would do anything to get their life back, and to waste it is not good. The third detail is you will begin to hate the person because the person doesn't care about anything but the computer. Those were the reasons to explain my opinion on the computer fact in the newspaper I read, and I believe it is a serious issue for our community's well-being."
258	258	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Spending too much time on the computer is never a good thing, whether you are doing work or things for pleasure. I strongly believe this because being on the computer too long will mean that you are spending less time exercising, interacting with real family and friends rather than on the internet, and being on the computer too long can ruin your vision. Nowadays, with all the great advances in technology, people are always glued to computer screens. Let's face it, once you go on the computer, it can get pretty addicting with all of the fabulous things you can do, and when we get addicted, we don't feel like doing other things like exercising. Studies show that a large percentage of kids who use his or her computer for more than several hours a day are obese. The cause of this problem is obvious, and it is kids being addicted to computers. Since they are so addicted to computers, they do not want to go to the gym or engage in physical play. Another example is that in school, kids have a choice of what electives they want to take. Many kids would rather choose the computer programming class rather than physical education, which also cuts down on their exercise time. Computers are wonderful things, but when they start affecting your health and physical fitness, they become enemies. Interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive, but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life. For instance, some people develop a habit from only interacting through the computer that makes them anti-social in real life. Furthermore, some kids can be the most pleasant people to interact with through the computer, but then when you see them in real life, they are the quietest people in the world. This happens because they are more comfortable interacting through the computer and have lost their abilities to interact face-to-face. Interacting through the computer is great if you have family and friends in other countries, but you shouldn't do it so much that you become uncomfortable interacting in real life. Your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body. Most people do not know this, but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes, which is bad. This strain only leads to unpleasant things. For example, if you are addicted to computers, then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life. A recent poll was taken, and over a majority of people who use their computers for more than a few hours a day have gotten glasses. Another example is that over time, the strain builds up to the point where even with glasses you can hardly see. Imagine a world where your vision is so bad that it is like your eyes are almost closed; that's what happens to people who use their computers too long. Local newspaper, you may think that computers are one of the greatest inventions ever, and you are right; however, you shouldn't use it too much, as moderation is key to a healthy and balanced life.
259	259	1	3	As time goes on, our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology, such as the television. What I really want to write about is the computer. Society today has developed a very unhealthy habit, and it is always using the computer. Everyone in the twenty-first century uses a computer. The world got so used to having the computer around that if all the computers in the world were to break, then most people probably would not know how to function normally. This relates to the basic theory of the Y2K scare, which was that the world was predicted to end back in the year two-thousand because everyone thought that computers were going to crash and lose all the data that we have ever recorded. Humanity relies way too much on the computer. Since many people rely on the computer for work and entertainment, a lot of people forget to exercise! Our body needs exercise to live. Exercise is one of the most important activities in our daily lives. When you don't exercise, and all you do is eat junk food and drink soda, you better bet that you're going to either get diabetes, the flu, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it; why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an innocent invention. Nowadays, people literally worship the computer like it is a deity. People who use the computer all day every day end up becoming very lazy because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity, whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis, or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active at least three times a week for many reasons; the fact is, that if you exercise three times a week at the least, your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. Exercise can be fun as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. Exercise should be a huge part of your daily routine, not sitting on your buttocks all day searching pointless videos online. The way you want to live your life is up to you, and I hope you start living it healthier and more actively for your own well-being.
260	260	1	3	Over one million people are on the computer daily. I think being on the computer is unhealthy. So many people abuse themselves by staying on too long. You should manage a time schedule so you can still get exercise and don't use the computer unless it is needed. People can become overweight also from this sedentary lifestyle. I think people should do something else then use the computer for long hours. One main effect that I see is many people play on the computer too long and are becoming overweight. This can be stopped if we all join together. One person isn't going to change anything, but many of us will. We can be like huge dangerous predators going for the prey. If there is something else to do besides play on the computer, do it. If you know you're over weight from the computer, you can make a change. If you keep doing other activities, you can get healthy again easily; you just have to make that type of commitment. A serious issue is people don't wanna take time to make a quick little chart to manage computer usage. The way I see it is if we make a chart, then we will know when to get off and when to play. This is important because some people take in information better when they have it in front of them, and this could make some satisfying results. People use the computer for school work, which is good depending on how long it takes. In my opinion, people shouldn't be on the computer for more than a couple of hours a day. I think people should get their schoolwork done and get off. I much rather see kids outside playing in the fresh air. The nature and wildlife is much more important for our development. The effects the computer puts on us can vary, from leading to overweight issues to not spending time with families, to delaying schoolwork. You need to use your time wisely and balance screen time with physical activity and real-world interactions for a healthier lifestyle.
261	261	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe many people spend too much time on computers. It is okay to be on a computer for twenty minutes, to a half an hour for a quick task. But one hour or more, is too long and can become unhealthy. People could get sucked in by playing addicting games that demand constant attention. Also by online chatting services like facebook, myspace, instant messaging, and more which encourage endless conversation. Another way, I think someone could spend more time on a computer is working on a report. They might start it last minute and feel pressured to finish. These are just some of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers. Have you ever hopped on the computer and played a game? Then you look at the time and its an hour later? Games are very addicting. you can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by, completely losing track of your surroundings. Games are very fun, but they fry your brain with their constant stimulation. @PERCENT1 of the human population spends up to an average of two hours on a computer each day. I think, we should eliminate some games off the internet, so people can spend days exercising and hanging out with friends, not playing silly games indoors. Have you ever started a conversation with someone and realized you have been talking for an hour and a half? And that you have homework waiting for you? @PERCENT3 of teenagers on average spend three hours each day chatting with friends on the internet. Facebook, myspace, instant messaging are all examples of this. It is okay for someone to talk to their friends, but you need to watch the time so you do not get carried away and neglect your responsibilities. I think, we should cut down our use on these websites, so children and teenagers can get their homework done on time. Have you ever been assigned a report and wait till the last minute to get it started? Many teenagers do this. They wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due, causing unnecessary stress. They then, are stuck on the internet for hours trying to get it done, searching for information in a panic. Which makes their grade lower then if they were to start it earlier and take their time. @PERCENT2 of students wait till last minute to do their reports, on average, they spend over four hours on the computer. I think we should make sure that students start their report earlier so it could bring up their grades and reduce their stress. In conclusion i believe people have spent way too much time using computers, due to games, internet chatting, and reports being done last minute. I think if we eliminate games off the internet, cut down use on internet chatting, and start reports earlier, people will start exercising, hanging out with friends and family, get homework done and get higher grades, leading to a more balanced and healthy life.
262	262	1	3	Do you think being able to look up information on anything or talk to people that are far away is good? With a computer these are some things that you will be able to do, making the world feel smaller. Being able to talk to anyone that is far away is good for maintaining relationships. Some people have family in other countries that they have not seen in a long time and with a computer you can talk to them and see their faces. @CAPS1 the people we have sent to @ORGANIZATION1 they have a Family here and I have heard of them using computers to talk to them because they miss them dearly. Also if you live in an area that gets bad weather and you can not go anywhere a computer can help pass the time in a productive way, @CAPS1 the people that live in the @CAPS2 they can get a lot of snow during the winter time and @MONTH1 have to stay inside for their safety. So if they have a computer they are able to do things @CAPS1 play some games or can watch some videos to pass the time until the weather clears. Another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything you can imagine. You are able to learn about faraway places even if you have never been there just by looking it up online. Some kids do have some trouble with some homework but can use a computer to learn some more about it and hopefully they will now understand how the work is suppose to be done instead of going to the teacher tomorrow and telling them that you did not do it, which helps them learn independently. There are my opinions why a computers have a positive effect on people. By being able to search anything, help children with homework, and pass the time if you have nothing to do, computers prove to be a valuable tool in our daily lives.
263	263	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 minute of the day - millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops, but is it always a good thing? The question has been raised if people spending a lot of time on computers is a bad thing. Computers are a bad thing because people spend too much time on them and lose quality time with friends and family. The dangers of online interaction, and the risk of having your information stolen are also significant concerns. Countless people around the world face these problems everyday and computer usage should be lessened to prevent them. Whether teens, kids, or adults are gaming, on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers. For example, of the @PERCENT1 of people who have computers with online access @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours a day on them, which is a substantial amount of time. This is about @NUM2 billion hours of computer usage around the world, a truly staggering figure. Children and adults alike have lost face time or interaction with other human beings face to face, leading to social isolation. Before computers kids played outside running and playing around in the fresh air. While in present day less than @PERCENT3 of all children get at least one hour of time outside, which is a worrying statistic. Computers are not a bad thing, but it is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health and development. These facts have not just contributed, but they are almost the cause of obesity in the world, linking screen time to physical health issues. Computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems and encourage a more active lifestyle. The addition of online chat to computers has not only increased computer usage but doubled it in many households. The invention of @CAPS2, and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing, but it sure did turn into one with unforeseen consequences. Online chat allows people to send hateful and vulgar messages to their enemies without showing their face, enabling cyberbullying. In some cases some teens were harassed online so bad they committed suicide, which is a tragic outcome. Another bad thing about @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 is that dangerous criminals can hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place where they can be kidnapped. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 users of online chat was lured by a criminal to a "" meeting place"" and was kidnapped and never seen against last year, highlighting a real danger. Most of these victims do not return or are found, leaving families devastated. Although the invention of chat online was meant as quick easy communication it became a horror crime in most cases, perverting its original purpose. Millions even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers who exploit security weaknesses. These hackers break the security codes and buy things online using other peoples money, committing fraud. Four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and @NUM5 out of those four people have had at least one account hacked, showing how common this is. This problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites that are not properly secured. If this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt from the cumulative theft. These hackers know who you are, your family, your personal information, and where you live, making them a serious threat. Internet usage needs to be cut down to safer sites to minimize risk. If we do not then usage will increase, there will be more chat problems and peoples money will get stolen, leading to greater harm for everyone involved."
264	264	1	3	Dear editor, @CAPS1 do you do all day? The answer to that would probably be sit down in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day, which is a common routine for many. My friends say that this is very unhealthy, research as proven it and my mom has had experience with the computers, so they speak from knowledge. This just isn't healthy for our environment and people, as it promotes a sedentary lifestyle. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 my friends say that computers are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 time that could be spent on better activities. Most people who interact on the computer all day don't have a stable diet or even a good exercise routine, neglecting their physical health. They say that all the junk kids and grown-ups accumulate in their daily life is unhealthy and will never go away unless they get up and move around. They also say that without exercise our country will be filled with over weight people, leading to a public health crisis. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that computers are bad for you when used excessively. @PERSON1 has gone all over the country to talk to people, and he specifically stresses that more people should get out and enjoy the nature but, no their sitting in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer which is not good for them, missing the world outside. He's taught people that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 the time if you get out and have fresh air your life will be so much better and more fulfilling. My mom has had experience with computers and assures me that when she was younger you couldn't just sit there and not get out, as life was more active. She says that it's important to interact with your family and friends so you keep a stable relationship with those you care about. Talking to your family will keep them intact with @CAPS1's going on in your life and hanging out with your friends will help with having more @ORGANIZATION1 a life without your household, building stronger social bonds. She says any kid who does sit in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day should be disappointed @ORGANIZATION1 themselves for missing out on real experiences. Editor you've done a wonderful job since you've taken the job! So, I feel that if you stress the point in your next newspaper about not having computers all the time you should always exercise like my friends say, the research as taught to enjoy your nature and my mother says to interact with your family and friends. I'm sure your next article will be a wonderful dream to people stating facts and encouraging a healthier balance in life.
265	265	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be to much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society, making real interaction harder? Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go, raising privacy concerns. And then there is the content of what you are viewing, which can be inappropriate. I can't wait to get to that paragraph and discuss it further. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight, which was concerning. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1, showing a clear trend. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside, but that creates other problems. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart from a previous point. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt they saw on screen. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that in real life, which is a dangerous lesson. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online, tracking your digital footprint? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12, which can feel intrusive? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses who want to target you. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button, often without reading the terms. So spam email comes flooding into your inbox. But something even worse is on the way, which is identity theft. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there and mentioned the financial risk. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish without a trace. So be responsible with your online security. This brings us to our last subject, which is a difficult one. The touchy one about inappropriate content. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women, which was harder to access. Now, it is just the click of a button away, making it far too easy to find. And that is bad enough for developing minds. Young boys are snagged early by such content, their futures now controlled by this disease of addiction. But add to that the immense risk of a virus attack from visiting such sites, and you're in a heap of trouble with your device and your personal data. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing when used without caution. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien in a game. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly and with awareness of the potential downsides to ensure a positive experience.
266	266	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly agree that computers have affected people in a very positive way. Since more and more people have been using computers, the technology gets higher and people can access much more things. Computers are good because they are convenient, and provide entertainment. Have you ever wanted to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is, or what the weather is in @LOCATION2? To find out these answers, all you have to do is look them up on the computer! The computer is so convenient, that whenever you have a question about anything, you can use the computer! Take my cousin Courtney, for example, everyday, her teacher assigns definitions for homework. So, she just looks up the definitions on the computer instead of taking the time to find them in the dictionary, saving her a great deal of time. However, @PERSON4 isn't the only person who thinks the computer is convenient. When surveyed, @PERCENT1 of people voted that when they have a question about something the computer is the most convenient item to use. Professor @PERSON2, from @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS1, since more people are learning how to use the computer, it is becoming more convenient to everyone."" In conclusion, many people rely on the computer for information, and you wouldn't want to take that away from them, would you? It's a @DATE1 @TIME1, and you're bored, what do you do? How about go on the computer! The computer is a great source of entertainment. Whether its listening to music, playing games, or talking with friends, you will always have fun on the computer. For example, my neighbor, @PERSON3, comes home after school by herself. She is usually extremely bored, so, she goes on the computer and plays games, and talks with friends. @PERSON3 can also talk to her cousins, @PERSON5 and @PERSON6, that live in @LOCATION1, making her feel less lonely. But, @PERSON3 is not the only one who talks to relatives on the internet. When surveyed, @PERCENT2 of people agreed that they talk to relatives from other places on the computer. Dr. @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""The computer is the main source of entertainment for most teens and adults."" @CAPS2, you wouldn't want to take away our main source of entertainment, would you? After school, many teens and adults go rushing to the computers for all different reasons. But, in conclusion, computers have positively affected all people with their amazing convenience, and great sources of entertainment."
267	267	1	3	To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 the joy of just clicking a mouse and all of the sudden you are talking with a friend you haven't seen in years. Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importances and plan things and a lot more. First, computers have become a vital part of education and research alike. Students at schools, elementary through college, are able to connect with much more information than without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children, allowing them to study at their own pace. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer, to model disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago. Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the @CAPS2. I recently got a facebook account, and within a few days I had found and connected to three friends of mine that had moved away, a distant cousin who had moved to @LOCATION1 that I haven't seen since we was little, and even my great grandmother! The possibilities are endless. Email has also been very beneficial to society as well, as @CAPS5 helps people communicate and plan events, which brings me to my next topic. Lastly, computers help the @CAPS2 communicate with one another. The internet is filled with websites made to benefit our @CAPS2, one being @ORGANIZATION2; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. If not for computers this program wouldn't have been as successful and beneficial as @CAPS5 has become. Also, there is an amazing website that combines education with the aspect of @CAPS2 @CAPS5 quizzes you on different levels of general knowledge and for each correct answer, @ORGANIZATION1 donates @NUM1 grains of @ORGANIZATION1. When I am bored I sometimes go on, and so far I have filled over thirty bowls of @ORGANIZATION1, while learning at the same time! To conclude, computers have proven to benefit the @CAPS2 and all in @CAPS5, not only people but the environment, too. Computers help advance research, help people reconnect with one another, and help the @CAPS2 communicate, Who knows what computers will help us accomplish next?
268	268	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 I would like to tell you something. Throughout the ages we have been evolving, from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly. With evolution we discovered technology and in recent years we have been making new technologies rapidly. Some say that some technology like computers are bad, I think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about far away places, let you talk to people online and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers let you go places that you ordinarily wouldn't be able to go to. If you were doing a research project on @LOCATION1 and you didn't have any books what would you use? That's right, a computer; the internet would have the facts you needed, so you could get a good grade. While on the internet you could talk to friends and family who @MONTH1 live far away. The computer goes over long distances and connects both computers so you can send writing almost instantly. Without computers you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people so easily. Using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. It helps you with your hand-eye coordination. When you see things on the screen and go to click it you are actually helping out your body and improving your reflexes. Some people say that when you are on the computer you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. I myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too! I love computers, don't you? They are a wonderful tool for both learning and connecting with others.
269	269	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, yes, I do believe that far too many people are 'addicted' to the computer, and spend more than enough time on the computer everyday! Not only teenagers but children and youth have fallen into the trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer; all I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before and I now believe the computer takes time away from family time, from sitting down to read a good book and from hanging out with friends. Instead of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook, myspace, twitter, youtube, addicting games, and whatever else they could find. I do not agree with being stuck to the computer like a mouse is to cheese. No! If there was one thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distract kids and teenagers from doing other things in life, also it doesn't allow families to be a family. Before computers were made all people had was their family. Coming home from school saying ""@CAPS3 dad, I'm home from school. Want to go play see catch""? Instead of that kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to your facebook message. Computers also cut off interacting time that families used to have. On @DATE1 at @TIME1 instead of talking to @CAPS5 on myspace, why don't you grab and play a family board game! Or go out to a restaurant, talk about your next vacation and what you'd be interested doing, go to the same field have a game, or to your local baseball field and play kickball, instead of sitting there mesmerized by the computer screen! Okay, I @MONTH1 understand that some people just @MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise and that is totally understandable but that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer instead of reading a book. Reading is yet fun but it is also educational, without being in school! As you read your brain does inner works, you learn new words or your vocabulary expands so you can show off to your friends or family. It is shown that @PERCENT1 of students who read perform better academically. Not the @PERCENT2 who sit at the computer all day writing replies. We must encourage more balanced and fulfilling activities."
270	270	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 sun, I find that computers are very useful. They help people in many ways. They let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach hand eye coordination, and let you meet people online. First, people can learn about what is going on around the world. I can find out what is happening where I live by looking up your newspaper online. Other people can find out about places they might go. They can find out what the weather is like so they know how to pack when going places. Also, if one of your employees is going camping they can look up a good place to camp and they can look up what kind of dangers there are when you camp so they can avoid them, because if they get sick they can't work. As you can see computers are important for planning and safety. Next, computers teach hand eye coordination. Many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands. Lets say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it. They must be able to work well with their hands to fix it. Now lets say the wiring in your lights get messed up. So you call an electrician who has to be good with his hands to be able to work with small wires. Both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers and developing fine motor skills. As you can see, computers are important in today's life for developing job skills. Lastly, computers let you meet new people online. Lets say you are all alone after a hard day of making newspapers. You could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games. Now lets say that one of your employees just broke up with his girlfriend and he is sad and lonely, so he isn't working as well. He could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl. Now when he comes to work he is happier and making more papers and if he makes more papers you make more money. As you can see computers are very important for social connection and overall morale. In conclusion, computers are wonderful machines. They can let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach people good hand eye coordination and let people meet new people online, making them invaluable in our modern society.
271	271	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they disable you. For example, say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him, finding detailed information quickly. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there, discovering local customs and attractions. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But if I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book, spending hours in the library; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another example could be like you need pictures to make the project look better. So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project, adding visual appeal. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it, reading travel blogs and reviews. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go, which is very convenient. But to wrap it up I have one more example. Lastly, chatting some people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for example, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once, sharing messages and photos. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, making it feel personal. All that's all I can think of. I hope that my letter and probably many others show you about what computers actually do for us.
272	272	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps their education, you can talk to family and friends, and you can get better hand-eye coordination. Read on to find interesting details about computers and their positive effect. @CAPS4 first reason that computers are positive is that it can help you with your education. I mean come on, how many college students do you see without a laptop? You see none. Am I right? You always need a computer because you have to type everything, and do research for big essay papers, accessing online journals and articles. People think ""well, there's always the library?"" @CAPS1 your wrong. @CAPS4 local library closes at @TIME1 pm. I'm sure college students are up way later than @TIME1 doing homework. Just imagine, late at night, @NUM1 pm, no library, no computer, and a giant essay due tomorrow. What are you going do? @CAPS1, you better get yourself a laptop before the next giant essay comes! @CAPS2, even if you did go to the library, who wants to lug all of your books down stairs, and drive to the library and then finally get there and realize you forgot something. Thats just a waste of time and energy! Next, computers are positive because you can talk to your friends and family. For one it saves a load of money because email doesn't cost anything! I have a @ORGANIZATION1 email and I don't pay a cent for it! With a cellphone you have to buy the phone and pay the bill every month. Did you know the average american spends at least #@NUM2 each month on cellphones? It's out @CAPS2, what if you never see a certain family member? I know @CAPS4 cousin just had a baby and her dad lives in @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. So, she got a webcam, and now everyday they talk, and her dad gets to see the baby grow. They think the they always talk about everything day, and other things, feeling connected despite the distance. After, I have just said all these wonderful things, you look someone in the eyes and then say that computer don't help people. For @CAPS4 final reason, computers are positive because you could gain hand-eye coordination, @CAPS4 brother, @PERSON1, loves, and I mean obsessive love, loves video games. He's addicted to them! He can't stop playing them, and I dont mind at all. I dont mind because now he can chew gum, jot down ideas for his essay, think about whats he's gonna have for lunch, and play a video game all at once. How's that for multi tasking! @CAPS2, you will be healthier. Think about it, better reflexes, better hand-eye, better and happier doctor! I mean seriously, if you play computer games you can have fun while knowing your going to make your doctor happy. And who do sent want to make your doctor happy! For @CAPS4 conclusion, computers have a positive effect on you because they help your education, talk to your friends and family, and have better hand-eye coordination. Tell me right now that computer don't help people. I know, you can't because computers help us in so many ways every single day."
273	273	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that computer have bad effects on people. The first reason why I think this is because people in the world are becoming less healthy; kids and adults should stay @CAPS3 more. Kids and parents should only be allowed @NUM1 @CAPS4 on the computer then go outside. Computers are not so bad because @CAPS5 is helpful for looking up information but @CAPS5 is harmful if @CAPS5 u abuse @CAPS5. Kids play games on the computers and @CAPS5 damages there eyes and @CAPS5 makes them lazy, not wanting to move. Also going outside there are lots of things to do instead of talking with your friend on the computer; you should call your friend ask him to come over play games outside, like sports. @CAPS6 this continues lots of kids will be fit and @CAPS3, leading healthier lives. The second reason why computers are bad is because of what people post on the computer about other people. Do not ever put something bad up on the computer because sometimes they are deep secrets and million of people will see @CAPS5 and that person might be teased and laughed at, which is very hurtful. And really the computer could do horrible things; @CAPS6 you and this person are friends @CAPS5 could break you guys forever, ruining a good relationship. The final reason why the computer is not good is because people are dieing from overweight. There is several teams that are on commercials saying that kids and adults @CAPS7 up and be @CAPS3 @CAPS6 @CAPS5 wernt for these heroes much much more kids would die faster. When kids die they look at whats inside of them and scientists found big fat chunks around the kids heart, which is very scary. Well thats my theory I hope all of you listen to my advice @CAPS7 up shut the computer off and @CAPS7 @CAPS3 for a better life.
274	274	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 would you like to be warmly greeted by the zingbobway tabe @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION2, say hi to a far away family member again or maybe quicker your reflexes? Well you can! Computers are a useful way @ORGANIZATION1 completing an @ORGANIZATION1 these tasks. Imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away. Wouldn't you want to see them at least once? Computers allow you to interact with them with webcams. You can see them and talk with them, hearing their voice. Not only can you talk with family, you can talk to friends. You can make new friends from around the world without leaving your house, learning about different cultures. You can have a new best friend every day! Not only can you talk to people on computers, they give you better hand eye coordination, and they quicken your reflexes. Dr. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says ""@CAPS2 have shown that people who type or use a computer have better reflexes than those who don't."" @CAPS3 a computer around is easier for school also. I remember one time, I had to write a @NUM1 page paper for @CAPS4 and it was due the next day. I wrote the beginning @ORGANIZATION1 it and my hand started to cramp up. I had to finish my paper soon so I ran to my computer and typed it in half the time I would've spent writing it. I also got a good hand-eye coordination from all the typing. Not only do you type on it, you learn on it. @NUM2 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM3 computers are used for learning about places and people. Say you just won @NUM1 free tickets to go anywhere in the world with a celebrity at your choosing! With a computer you could research anywhere you want and make that trip the best days @ORGANIZATION1 your life, planning every detail. And even if you don't like actually going to other places, you can virtually go there on a computer. With computers you can see the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, the tropical reef fish @ORGANIZATION1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 at the. Computers hold the world at your finger tips, offering endless information. So as you can see computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to interact with cities, increase your hand-eye coordination, and allow you to have the world at your fingertips. So stop reading and use a computer to see for yourself!"
275	275	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Advances in technology and computers is a bad thing. When the computer company's such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1, make cool updates to their computer systems people do not want to shut their computer off, which is not a good thing. As a child did you spend all of your time indoors and online? Computers take time away from spending time outside, or exercising. And they affect very crucial family time. Computer advances are bad for our country and town. Now-a-days, kids would much rather spend time on their computers than outside. This can have a very negative affect. First of all, it is important that students see and feel nature, and last time I checked they can not do that on a computer. Children need to see animals, smell the sweet scent of flowers and feel the breeze brush against their cheeks, experiencing the real world. A second reason that going outside is important is for the sun. Even though the sun does have harmful days, it is still important for health that everyone spends some time in the sun for vitamin D. The computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous for development. Computer also take precious time away from exercise. If people spend all their time on computers, then when do they exercise? Everyone is supposed to get at least @NUM1 minutes of activity daily, but no one ever spends that much time working out. Also, obesity numbers have increased greatly since the invention of personal computer and the internet. Obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to disease, creating health problems. Life with computers has lead to less people exercising and obesity rates increasing. Another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families. Family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family, talking and sharing stories. Plus with encouragement from their family, many students excel in school and sports, which gives them great self-confidence. Computers take time away from something that should be the most important to everyone, family. Many people are affected negatively by computers. The technology takes very important time away from children and adults. It takes time away from the outdoors, exercising, and family. Yes, computers @MONTH1 make life easier, but they have a much more negative affect than they do a positive one, and we must be mindful of this.
276	276	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from school and go online aimlessly, just so they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 children are obese, and I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun and be more active. Also, kids will learn how to interact with each other in person by playing outside together, which is a vital social skill. The kids will see more nature and be able to learn more about animals and the environment around them. When kids are on computers they are just sitting there, not moving and doing nothing physically productive. Also, some kids post pictures of themselves on things like Facebook that are not appropriate and can get them in lots of trouble with strangers or at school. They also say things online that they wouldn't normally say to a person's face, which can lead to cyberbullying. The computer is simply a way for kids to get into trouble. When you're outside playing baseball, football, or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and you're having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obese. Some say the computer is good for hand-eye coordination, but catching a football or hitting a baseball is better and healthier. Also, some say computers can tell you about far away places but that is what school and books are for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends in person is better than talking to your friends online or video chatting with them. @CAPS2 are too many overweight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not helping the cause of improving our health and well-being.
277	277	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION2 press, I wonder if you know that @PERCENT1 of people out of @NUM1 surveyed by the university out @LOCATION1 agreed that using laptops and computers had a very good benefit on their life? I agree that computers benefit society and our everyday lives. With a computer, you can interact with people all around the world, they can help with school work, and make everyday life easier. Five years ago I had to move from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION3. We had to leave all of our family and friends behind. However, with this great technology, we could e-mail them, instant message them, and video chat with them, instead of having to pay out money to make long distance calls. There are many people out there like me, who have friends and family far away, whether it's family in different countries, old school mates, or camp friends; using a computer is a great way to keep in touch with one another. Using a computer can also make life easier. Moms taking care of their kids might not be able to go to @CAPS1 & @CAPS2 with one kid not wanting to get off his video games, the other watching their favorite @CAPS3 show. Thankfully that mom can go online, pick the food that she wants and the quantity, and she can get someone to deliver it right to her door. That mother also might not be able to get out and go shopping for clothes. So with her computer she can go to her favorite store's website and pick the clothes she wants from the comfort of her home. And then when @CAPS4 comes, a computer can be great to not worry about not having enough time to go out. A computer just makes life that much simpler! Statistics show how people get help online instantly or find what they need. ""Computers are great, I can do homework and know that if they need to write a paper, then they can look up information. If they can find more information on the computer from @CAPS5.com, then they could ever find in their local library. You can find almost anything with search engines on your computer! Some people do disagree with the use of computers, or some also believe that some people abuse the benefit of computers and spend too much time on it and not exercising and enjoying nature enough. This is true, but as long as you stay reasonable with usage of your computer, it benefits you in many ways. Like I said, it's great for keeping connections between people, simplifying everyday life, and doing research for school, making it an invaluable tool for modern living."
278	278	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers affect people in a positive way. Computers increase our knowledge, let us communicate with our friends and family, teach us hand-eye coordination, and let us see our news faster. Computers are enjoyable, great pieces of technology. Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen is not very interactive, computers increase our knowledge immensely. Computers have all these websites that are full of great information. You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want in seconds. Going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time that you could save. Instead you can look up the facts you need online quickly and efficiently. Computers also let us communicate with family and friends easily. Calling someone or sending a letter costs money, but sending an email to someone does not, making it a free and fast option. Many people have family and friends that live far away from them. Through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense, which is wonderful. You can also see each other through a webcam, which you can attach to your computer if it does not have one already, making the conversation more personal. Another reason why computers are useful is because they help with hand-eye coordination. Computers require you to type, which is a great and necessary skill in today's world. While working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring, you can type up the essay on your computer neatly and quickly. Typing takes practice to get good at but is very helpful for school and future jobs. Finally, computers help us get our news faster. When major things happen, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1, it was all over the internet before the news programs even reported it. In conclusion, computers are very useful and help us increase our knowledge, communicate with people, help us with hand-eye coordination, and let us see our news faster, making them an essential part of modern life. But most importantly, computers are fun and educational tools for everyone to use.
279	279	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that advances in technology have many positive effects, such as computers. Computers are great for people of all ages. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and allow people to learn information from all over the world. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate through the internet instantly. Advances in technology improve society and the overall way of life around the globe. Advances in technology are amazing, and computers show these advances greatly. With the simple use of a computer, one can learn great hand-eye coordination skills. Typing skills are a great example of this. Typing skills are needed by almost everyone in the world today. Without computers, no one would develop these essential skills so easily. A young child can go on the computer, play a game, and learn basic typing and hand-eye coordination skills to jump start their coordination skills for the rest of their life, which is fantastic. Advances in technology are great for learning. These advances in computers can also allow people to learn worldwide information quickly. Many times in school, students are asked to do a report on a different country. It would be very hard to do that report without a computer, requiring many library books. The student would need to go through all different books to find specific information needed, which takes time. With the internet, that project can get done a lot faster just by typing whatever you need to know into a search bar. How about that family vacation you've always wanted to go on? Need an idea of where to go? Use the internet! All you need to do is type in vacation spots and click enter. Instantly, you will have hundreds of choices right in front of you, with pictures and reviews. This makes life a lot simpler and planning more fun. Do you remember the last time your mom or dad went on a business trip and you couldn't talk to them because they were busy? There is a fix to this with the internet. You can communicate with them through @CAPS1, @CAPS2 or both, no matter where they are. Just hook up your @CAPS2 to the computer and instantly say good @TIME1, or ask hows it going. If you have a friend online you can instant message them right away. It is so easy that it will seem like you are standing right next to them in a matter of seconds. In conclusion, computers and advances in technology are great and can benefit everyone in the world; computers teach hand-eye coordination, allow one to learn information from around the world, and allow communication through the internet to happen instantly, bringing people closer together. Writers and editors of the newspaper, please agree with me on this topic. Advances in technology can only add positive effects to the way of life, and we should support them for a better future for everyone.
280	280	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They even allow people to talk online with others. Computers are a very useful piece of machinery for everyone. Computers teach valuable hand-eye coordination. When you're in school, you need to type lots of @CAPS1 prompts, @CAPS2 labs, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocab lists. Computers help us do that efficiently. Typing fast and correctly takes practice and focus. Typing without looking at the keyboard is a key part of hand-eye coordination. This will help us later on in life also, in many jobs. Whether it's typing term papers in high school or your application essay for college, you will need the help of computers to do it well. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places from home. @NUM1 years ago I took a trip to @LOCATION3 for the first time. I didn't know a lot about the history of @LOCATION3 so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was like I was in @LOCATION3 before I even arrived! I read about the delicious food and the rich culture of the people. I took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7, seeing it all on my screen. I heard @CAPS8 music and learned some @CAPS8 phrases. In just @NUM2 hour I visited @LOCATION3 right from my very own house, which was an amazing experience! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country without the cost of a plane ticket. Computers allow people to talk online with other people easily. This is a very good thing for staying connected. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2 and because of the @NUM3 hour time difference, it's not always easy to talk on the phone, so we use the computer instead. My family will send e-mails back and forth with them, sharing news and photos. Sometimes we will even video chat, which is almost like being in the same room! @CAPS3 networking sites accessible by computer such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see in person. On @CAPS11 you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians and follow their updates. Computers let us keep in touch with others across any distance. Computers have a positive effect on people, despite what some may say. Some experts @MONTH1 say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that may be true for some people, it's not true for everyone. We still exercise, and we still spend time outside enjoying the fresh air. We still interact with family and friends in person, but now we are also able to do so on the computer when needed. More and more people using computers is a good thing for education and communication in our modern world.
281	281	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper writer, I believe that computers benefit our society because we could connect to people more faster and easier. And computers are good for our society because we don't have to spend too much time on the phone, waiting for a call back. That is why I think computers benefit our society. ""Are computers a good thing or bad thing?"" Computers are a good thing because you could email your family or friends any time you want to, which is more convenient than writing a letter. But sometimes we don't have to be on the computer so long, as it is important to take breaks. That is why I think computers are a good thing, but with moderation. Without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or send a text message, which can be slower. In my opinion I am really thankful that we have computers. And on computers you could go on everything like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and even work on the computer from home. That is why without computers it will be different and more difficult. I think people are not spending too much time on the computer, because a lot of people are on the computer to do office work and other important tasks. Computers make things a lot easier for us, like paying bills and shopping online! But sometimes people take advantage over it by playing games for too long. That is why I feel people are not spending too much time on the computer overall. Last but not least that is why I know computers benefit's our society by making daily life more efficient."
282	282	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research and finding information quickly. Without computers, kids and adults won't be provided with the necessary tools for knowledge and learning new skills. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home and that @NUM3 person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects and homework assignments. Another reason why computers are good is because it can bring the world together, making distances seem smaller. Facebook, @CAPS2, and twitter users can chat with people across the street, across the country and even across the ocean, sharing ideas and photos! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION3, creating global friendships. My last reason is that computers are great for businesses and their growth. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their business is about, attracting more customers. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper efficiently. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper and learn the news. Even though some people might abuse their computer privileges by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting with people but that's their own choice. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it, which is a small number! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer for entertainment. What can you do to change their habits? Nothing, really. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people, providing clear advantages for work and social life! They give us research, they help us with school and businesses and they allow us to talk to people around the world, making life better.
283	283	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think its a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because it does teach kids something, it is good to do homework on and you can relax when you're on it. Well computers teaches kids a lot of things like hand-eye coordination from using the mouse and keyboard. If kids want to work with computers when they're older they can learn how to work with it, gaining valuable skills for future jobs. There is also websites that can show you how to move your hands when using a computer, which helps with typing faster. Well when kids come from school they always have homework, and @CAPS2 you need to do it on the computer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do their homework properly. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they don't have computers what are they going to do, they would fall behind. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day, I feel tired. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax and unwind. If you guys were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time from stress and boredom. That is why I think you should keep computers and not exercise as much, since computers are useful tools. We get enough of that in school carry all these heavy books around in our backpacks.
284	284	1	3	Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are a great machine to use for many tasks. People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online easily. I think that computers have a good effect on people and their daily lives. Computers are one of the great inventions we have ever created. They are very helpful in our everyday life for work and fun. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know something about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet quickly. If you're writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet, just a search away. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to California you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do, you can see the whole world right from your computer screen. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer using online programs. Also if you're too busy to go to college or want to take another class there are even schools online for flexible learning. The computer is a great way to learn about new things and expand your knowledge. Finally you can talk to friends online; websites like Facebook and Myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends and family far away. Another positive way is @CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back, making conversations instant. If you want to talk to your friends you can just message them right away. I think that computers have a positive effect on people, helping them in many ways. They are helpful in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends from anywhere. I hope you see my point of view; they are something everyone should have to improve their lives.
285	285	1	3	"I walked into my living room and saw a familiar scene. I saw my mom avidly reading the screen of our computer with pictures of caller masters and logos cluttering the web page as well. I thought that the internet had just helped my mom better than I could, showing her that we should go on vacation to a nice place. More and more people log on to a computer everyday, and although the people willing to change and believe in new advances in technology put out a strong argument of why computers are good, there are still some that can only see the negative side. I strongly support computers and believe they have a lot of potential for helping us. Computers make the work even smaller and faster to complete. They allow you to talk to people thousands of miles away in an instant, which is amazing. Also, you can reconnect with friends that you can't see anymore due to distance. For example, I used to go to an awesome @DATE1 camp and I made some of my best friends there. But after @DATE1, they moved down south, and instead of playing sports and having fun together, I layed down on my basement floor too tired to stand up because my sweat glued me to the carpet. Then one day, I heard the familiar sound that my computer's speakers make when I receive an instant @CAPS1 message. I found the energy to crawl over to the screen, to find out that @PERSON1, one of my closest friends from camp, wanted to take a bike ride down to the wall, and hang out with some other people we knew. Needless to say I happily responded, ""@CAPS2 I definitely want to go,"" followed by a long string of happy emoticons. Had it not been for computers and @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, we would all have drifted apart and never talked again, losing touch. Another exaggerated argument people use against computer is that everybody that uses them doesn't exercise and becomes lazy. I frequent my computer almost every hour, so I made a system to ensure I got exercise and stayed healthy. Every time I walk into the room my computer is hooked up in, I grab the pull up bar and do @NUM1 pull ups. I only thought of this system @NUM2 months ago and I have already built up my own muscles, and I can do @NUM3 pull ups at a time but when I started I struggled to do @NUM2 properly. If not for the amazing ability of computers that brought me back to my friends, I would still try to do exercise, only to quit after about a week from lack of motivation. Computers give easy access to the internet, which has so much information it is almost endless. Unless it is a closely guarded secret, you could probably find whatever you want on the internet with a simple search. I've gone online countless times to find sources for an essay when the limited textbooks we have just isn't what you need for a good grade. My country project last @DATE1 year couldn't have had more than @CAPS5 pieces of information from a book, so the internet was essential! It also makes a great teacher of about any subject as well, providing tutorials and videos. As a matter of fact, my language arts teacher told us a story about how her brother, a guy that has never done any sort of water sports before, spent @NUM2 weeks watching videos on YouTube about how to waterski, and on his first try he was already doing tricks. These are only a few of the reasons I think computers are great and useful for everyone. They keep friendships close, give you a reason to exercise, and can teach you anything you want to learn! I say we spread the good word about computers and let every one know how awesome they are for work, learning, and fun."
286	286	1	3	Dear computer company, computers have a negative effect on our engagement with the real world. Why would you go outside if you could play life-like games on your computer? I think that the immersive games on the computer should be removed so people could finally step away from their screens and enjoy all of the great things in life. If people weren't on computers all day, they would pay more attention to the way they're destroying nature and perhaps be more motivated to protect it. Ultimately, reducing computer use would foster a healthier and more environmentally conscious society.
287	287	1	3	"Dear The Computer Times, Your resources, your entertainment, and even your communication with people might be fading. Perhaps you know a large portion of people think this technology is harming our society. Well, I will say I think they don't fully understand the many benefits that computers bring us. Computers act like teachers, instructing us without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination is a perfect example of a skill they help develop. Plus, we use computers to learn about distant places we might want to travel to, or to have a conversation with friends or family living far away from us. The computer is an extraordinary piece of technology. First, I'd like to say that everything you do physically uses hand-eye coordination, from making dinner and riding a bike to driving a car. And unfortunately, not all people are the best at hand-eye coordination. One of my friends, John, had horrible hand-eye coordination. So for his birthday, I decided on getting him a computer. It's been one month since he had his computer, and when he was trying to hit a baseball at his son's party, he managed to hit the ball seven out of ten times where he used to hit it one or two out of six. This is a tremendous increase in only one month! Just something as simple as a computer improved my friend's hand-eye coordination a tremendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far away places like the Arctic or the Sahara Desert. Do you really want to travel up to the icy cold and piercing winds of the Arctic just to learn about it? For some, I'd say they might like that, but what if you can't travel to the Arctic due to money or difficult flying conditions? I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry about such hardships. A statistic from the National Institute of Travel states that ""eighty percent of people would love to experience the thrill and excitement of the Northern Lights. But out of those eighty percent, only twenty percent said they'd actually travel to Norway to see them"". So you can see that sixty percent of those people wouldn't go, whether it be due to money or the cold. They clearly said that's why they love the computer; they can experience the Northern Lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold. Lastly, what better thing to do on the computer than connect with family you've never met before or don't get to see often? The editor for the Springfield Local states, ""My parents live over five hundred miles away. I rarely get to talk to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance often. So I use my computer; my parents and I now communicate fifty percent more than we used to. I love the computer; it helps keep me close to my loved ones."" As you can tell, thanks to the computer, he talks fifty percent more to his parents than he used to! In conclusion, the computer is a gracious device that is extremely beneficial to people. It teaches us hand-eye coordination, lets us learn about places we otherwise would never learn about, and allows us to have conversations with friends or family that we generally don't get to see often. Now, you go out and make sure that anyone who says computers are a horrible invention understands exactly why computers are so important for our modern lives."
288	288	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think that using your computer too much is bad for one's overall well-being. Some people spend way too much time on the internet, which leads to several negative consequences. Many people are too focused on the internet, and they neglect their normal daily activities. Also, the computer is bad for people because they will be on the internet all night and get no sleep, leaving them exhausted for the day ahead. A lot of people spend too much time on the internet, and since they are always online, they don't spend a lot of quality time with their families. This causes the internet-addicted person to lose important relationships with their family and friends. Not exercising is another common result of this addiction. For example, my stepbrother is always on the internet now; he doesn't talk to anyone because he is so preoccupied with his game. Another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused on the virtual world. When you are too focused on the internet, you forget there is a whole world out there that needs your help; most people won't do their chores or make a meal for their family. These people also have no time for the outdoor activities they used to enjoy. Internet addicts usually don't get any sleep, and they have no time to study at night because they spend all their extra time on the internet. During the day, they will be very tired in school or at work, and the internet will be the one to blame. Last month, my mom made a Facebook account, and she is constantly on it. When she is online, she ignores everything around her. My mom goes to school, and she tells me how she never has time to study because she is always on the internet. She also stopped reading the Bible in her spare time to go online. The internet is a bad thing to get hooked on; you lose relationships with your friends and family because you never get off the computer. People usually don't exercise or do their chores, which shows this is not a very good addiction to get into and can significantly harm one's quality of life.
289	289	1	3	"Dear Editor, The effect that computers have on people is not a positive one. I think people spend way too much time on computers, some information on computers is inaccurate, and there are still telephones and cellphones that people can use for communication. A majority of people's time is spent on the computer, whether it's playing games, checking email, or even working; people's valuable time is getting used up. This time could be better used by doing more important things such as being with friends and family, being outside with nature, or exercising. Being on the computer instead of exercising has had a huge effect on people's health. Some people are overweight because they eat and then do not exercise afterward. My sister works on the computer all day, and she says three or four ladies at her work are unhealthy because all they do is go on the computer and eat granola bars, which are usually healthy. If others spent at least a half an hour outside to get some fresh air instead of using a computer, most of them would feel a lot better. My doctor always used to tell me and my brother, ""Get out and play an hour a day!"" This is true, and I strongly encourage people to go outside and do an activity as opposed to playing on the computer. The computer is used a lot for researching, but some of the information on the computer is very helpful while other information is inaccurate. At least when you research using a book or encyclopedia, you can trust those sources. What if you had to do a report and you could only use the internet; how would you be able to tell if the information is trustworthy? Sure, computers also teach hand-eye coordination by playing video games, but when in real life will you need to know how to shoot a dragon or dodge candy that's falling from the sky? This is just an example of unneeded information and skills that keeps people wanting to go back on the computer. Another thing you can do on the computer is communicate with others. When computers weren't invented or even that advanced, people were more than happy to give one another a call. Now with computers, people email, instant message, or even use Skype, a webcam website. What even happened to cellphones? You can take them anywhere, proving that computers are not the only, or necessarily the best, tool for communication."
290	290	1	3	Dear reader, Lately, people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society, especially now that the majority of households now own one of these helpful machines. Computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm. Imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them; life would become much harder for the people living on this planet. Think of the successful schools in our country, and then think of which of those schools don't have computers. Computers are the easiest way to look up information, something important when children are learning. Whenever someone needs to know something, they just google it, which comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week. People have never been so knowledgeable. Computers are not only important for school but also in the workplace, where they serve almost the same essential functions. Now that computers are so common, people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher, saving time and effort with a more professional result. Computers also serve the important purpose of communication; using email or instant messaging, one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phone bill. Some parents see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger; however, it is also opening your eyes to new cultures. Now it's possible to learn about life in Japan first hand. If computers were no more, it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country; it's almost like isolation from the world. There are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages, and computers provide a better way than just sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk. As a person on this planet, do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they don't live close enough? A main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else; however, a recent study shows that after computers became widespread, more people have begun to read. This proves that just because there is now something fun and new, it doesn't mean everything else is trash; people will still continue to do things they always did, just with something new on their list. In addition, it is the option of everyone whether or not they want to spend their time on the computer. If someone doesn't like the idea, they've no right to take it away from someone else; computers were created to help the human race, not control it. If a person doesn't want one, they don't have to get one; everything is up to them, and that is the way it should remain. The next time you see a computer, don't think of it as some sort of obsession that's keeping people from doing other things they could be doing, but as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably wouldn't go to the library to look for. Computers aren't holding anyone back, but pushing everyone forward, whether at work, school, or even the house; they benefit everyone, everywhere, and are a fundamental part of modern progress.
291	291	1	3	Have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us? Now, we can learn about anything we want, talk with people on the other side of the world, and even advance in other areas of technology. Computers have, without a doubt, had a positive effect on people. Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, the next in a lush, steamy jungle thriving with animals...All without leaving your room! Using computers, people can learn about new places and things whenever they want. The millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about other places and times. Although this information @MONTH1 be in a local library, going on the computer is MUCH easier. Who wants to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library, when the internet is there for your use any time? No registration to get a library card. No late fees and no waiting lists for popular titles. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. @NUM1 out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message, or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive but with email, I can talk to my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. With e-mail and instant messaging, it was easy to talk, and exchange the latest news! Having the ability to communicate with someone easily is an unbelievable privilege, that would be nonexistent without computers to help us. Lastly, computers have helped people make advances in other areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have helped scientists to do complex experiments. With a simulated experiment they can be positive that no other variables will affect your results. Now, experiments can be extremely accurate. Computers have helped advance medicine as well. They have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases. Who knows, maybe in @NUM2 years there will be a cure for cancer. All of these amazing accomplishments have been positively effected by computers. Although some people @MONTH1 think that computers have a negative impact on our day-to-day life, I @PERCENT1 disagree. People have learning, talking, and advances in technology with one click of a mouse. Computers have effected people positively in many ways, so, click away!
292	292	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 the world forty years ago. People would need to travel to visit a library to research, every document, doctors notes, and building plan would have to be written by hand or on an old typewriter. Life would have been much more difficult. Today, computers allow us to communicate with one another, access the millions of websites on the internet and help with school work. Almost everyday, my mom and dad receive friend requests from long lost school friends as well as relatives and current friends. Today's computers allow the world to talk to one another and know what is going on. My dad always says "" @CAPS2 makes the world go round."" With the social networking sites, everyone is receiving tons of @CAPS2 about one another. Another way to communicate is by video chat. All @CAPS3 computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a @CAPS4. This will let you see the person's face you are talking to. I have heard many amazing stories about this. One is about a soldier in @LOCATION1 and his pregnant wife back home. The doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was, in a way, in two places at once. The man got to see his newborn baby and his wife. Computers can do amazing things! Another reason computers are great is their accessibility to the internet. There is this cool website called @CAPS5.Doctors.Com. If you have an illness or a symptom to something, all you have to do is type it in on the home page and it will list all the possible reasons or outcomes. It also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine. If we looked back in time, one would need to travel to a doctor and pay to have your problem checked out. Also computers help out immensely with school work and homework. Many teachers nowadays request or demand students to type their assignments because it is easy to read, and it is easier to correct. I also find it faster to type then print. Say that you need to research the periodic table and write down @NUM1 facts as well as all the elements. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject. All you need to do is type it in on google. You can also add an image by copy and pasting; which will enhance your work. Computers have helped students and teachers. Lastly, computers (and the keyboards) are helping people with hand - eye coordination. Many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students. I recently searched this topic on the internet and it showed a study done by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 that people who practice typing at least @NUM2 minutes a day, will experience increased hand-eye coordination to @PERCENT1 better. This increase would help many people with low coordination. Today, computers are helping the world in many ways. From communication, to internet accessibility, then to helping hand-eye coordination. The world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned."
293	293	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 opinion's on what effect's do computer's have on people is without the computer we couldn't research important people and event's. Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that @CAPS1 first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example who is harry @PERSON1. He was the @NUM1 president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing, making their work hard to read. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can alway's excrise around there house or around there block to stay healthy.
294	294	1	3	Dear readers of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 people today are debating whether having a computer benefits society. Computer benefit society in @CAPS1 way like it could help the children with their school work. Not @CAPS1 children are very out going but if they had a computer than that will really help them. Not @CAPS1 kids have ways to find out what their going to be in life. I'm pretty sure they don't care right now but the computer will help them out. As you can see the computer can help society. Every children who goes to school has homework since kindergarten to when they end school. The computer can help them with their math homeworks, their science, and even their social studies homework. When your kids get older starting middle school they have to do reports & projects that require knowledge to be able to write or do the paper. If you are a parent and can't take your children to the library to take out @CAPS1 books that could get lost and you would have to pay for something that has been bought and is not able to use again. But the computer prevents all of that for society. The computer can help the communication in so @CAPS1 ways. @CAPS1 kids like to go on @CAPS2 to chat and parents think that @CAPS2 is their world, but it could happen that they are arranging a group to form. Now a days their are a lot more shier people who are scared to @ORGANIZATION1 people and be friend. but now their could be a lot more depress. The computer could also help you because you could be late or unable to go to an appointment or to a meeting & you let the person in. This is a great way why computers help society. In society their are not a lot of people who now right away what they want to be when they grow up. If they use the computer and are really good at fixing them when they're broken that then can be a computer @CAPS3 are so @CAPS1 beautiful places that people take pictures of and up load them into their computer. Some people don't see their talent until someone points it out to them. @CAPS1 people could be have a bad day and write a story out of it and send it to some of their friends, @CAPS4 their friend can send it to a publisher and make this person @CAPS5. As you can see their are so @CAPS1 great ways you can use the computer to help your society. Readers the computer can help you in your school work. The computer can help the society communicate. It could also help people find their @CAPS6. I think that the computer does a great @CAPS6 helping the society.
295	295	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that technologies for kids and adults to use computers are a bad idea. I strongly believe that people have a bad affection people because you get addicted, you spend less time with your family and friends. Finally, you spend less time exercising and doing great opportunities for your self. Clearly, i think that letting students and adults use computers will take over their mind and make them addicted to the computer. This is very bad because when your addicted to something, you can't go back. This means you will not have time for anything else. For example, they might forget what life is about and what was around for us to live in. Addiction is hard to get over , so don't live your life in a box and play on nonsense, live your life to the fullest. Over all, addiction in everything, including computers is a horrible thing. Without a doubt, spending too much time on computers will rott your brain and make you lazy. Meaning that the less you exercise, the less active you are. This problem is especially for teens. Teens have computer every week, cell phones, ipods, and many more. Alot of teens get cranky and then become rude and nasty to their parents because they are testing to use them. As people dont exercise and move around alot, it can cause severe consequences like obesity and cancer. Obesity usually happens when you are eating food, but it can also happen by not eating and not exercising. People that arent moving become lazy and have no desire to do anything which will have an effect on their health. Overall computers cause people to not exercise and be less active which will cause health problems. Lastly, Computers make people spend less and less time with their family, and treat their computer as if the computers are their only friends. In everyday life , teens are on their cell phones , their computers listening to music. these electronics are causing a disconnect. If this goes on alot of teens will loose the people they care about. Computers are a waste of time because they can make you forget what is truly important in life because they have a negative affect on people who use computers and other electronics.
296	296	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I think that computers are very useful and that people learn a lot from them. The computer is very smart and is probably the best technology ever invented. Computers help when you need to know something about a certain person. Another example is it helps students with their homework. The last reason of why I think computers are useful is that they help you get a hold of family and friends. The first example of why I think computers are useful is they help you if you need facts about a person. One example is you want to go to your a policeman and your leader tells you to meet him at @ORGANIZATION1, so you go there and he tells you the person they are going after but you dont know anything about him and you need a computer to see what he is convicted for and see his criminal record. Another example is if your teacher wants you to do a report about ""@PERSON3 lopez,"" but you don't know anything about him so you would use the computer and read about his life and his achievements. The last example is if you want to learn about your country's history and the leaders behind it then you would use the computer to find accurate information. The second example is students and their homework. One example is when your teacher says ""I want a essay on @PERSON2 and I want it to be neat."" But you have very bad handwriting and you cant do it on paper you will have to use Word or a writing program on the computer. Another example is if you forgot to write down your homework in your agenda or something then you can go on the school website and see what your homework is for that night. The last example is if your teacher says find the book about the @CAPS1 and you go to the library but everyone is taken but you have one by tomorrow. So you can go on the computer and find a place that is closest to you that has the book available. The last reason of why I think computers are helpful in this society is because they help you get a hold of your friends and family. One example is if it takes too long to write letters to each other so you can run use online messengers for example like ""@CAPS2"" or even ""facebook and myspace."" Another example is if you don't send the letter to the write address so what you do is go online and ask a friend or family member for the correct one. The last example is if you want to see the person and talk to them so you can go on a webcam with them and even talk face to face. I hope you agree with my opinion and think computers are useful and also good for people. It helps people to learn about others and information about them. Second it helps students with school and homework, and lastly because they help you get a hold of family and friends. Therefore, I hope you like my letter and enjoy my opinion on this important subject."
297	297	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I assume you've heard about the ongoing debate about computers. I personally believe that computers do benefit society. I believe this because computers benefit by its online services, the internet, and overall help in other things. My first reason for why you should believe that they benefit society is that computers have online capabilities. By online I mean in chat rooms, online bank, etc. this helps because people talking to other people online can boost their morale. It can boost morale in situations like with military officers and soldiers because they don't get to see their family but online communication can change that in an instant. Online also helps because you can pay bills through your bank and it overall saves a trip to the bank and a waste of gas. So, online is my first point for why you, the local newspaper, should agree with me. My second reason is that the internet benefits a lot. The internet, a marvelous creation made @NUM1 years ago, is great because you can buy things on it, like on websites such as ebay, amazon, etc. This helps because it also saves time and effort. The internet is great also because with the internet, you can learn about foreign nations and their cultures. Finally, the internet helps because you can receive news through it. This benefits society because people can instantly hear about natural disasters and problems occurring in the community, rather than hoping to find it in the newspaper or on television. That's my second reason for why you should agree that computers do help. My final reason for why computers benefit is the help, overall in other situations used later rather than just the computer itself. For example one way the computer can help in the future, is that a student can research info about a subject online and it can help raise their grade on a project. A study has proven that computer training, by playing online games with other people, like in Call of Duty, helps boost soldiers' accuracy. It helps because it boosts their hand-eye coordination and it all increases their accuracy in target shooting by @PERCENT1. This may not seem like much but, on the battle field, it can make the difference between life and death. Computers not only help that but they are plentiful and can be used in places such as libraries or internet cafes. That is my final reason for why you should go with computers. Some people might believe that computers are a bad thing since they take time away from exercise, but that can easily be solved by using the internet to buy an indoor jogger. Computers benefit society by using online services, the internet, and overall help in future situations. These are the reasons for why I believe you should go for the cause of computers. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion on this matter.
298	298	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think computer use is good because it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. Also people will have the ability to learn about different states and countries. Lastly people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns. Those are all the reasons why I think computers are a good use. The first reason why I think people should use computers is it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. People will know how to stay focussed with their eyes and also know how to also use their hands all at the same time. To stay focussed with their eyes people would have to wear glasses for the light from the screen. Also so when they are typing they wont have to keep looking down all the time at the keyboard. When people coordinate with their hands on the computer its so they know where the different keys are and that is why computers are good for this. My second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries. They can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look through pictures and videos. Also they will be able to read about what different cultures they have and religions that are practiced there. In the states you can also be able to read about @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and how we have a wonderful state full of history. That's why computers are a good use for learning. My final reason why the use of computers is good is because people can interact with their family and friends online. There are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends to connect with them. You can talk to each other through messages and emails. Also you can talk to them even if they're in a different state or country. You guys can talk about a lot of different things that are happening in your lives. For example, you can talk about the family and life and even if you miss them you can tell them. Thats why computers are good for staying in touch. Those are my reasons why computers are good. Not only can it teach you about hand-eye coordination, family and friends, and about different states. But also you can play a lot of different games for fun and also type on a notepad for writing. Also if you're stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator on the computer for help. That's why people should use the computers for these many benefits.
299	299	1	3	Do you think computers have a negative effect on people? Well I don't, I think @CAPS2 is an easier way to get information faster. The three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people are to learn about faraway places, to have jobs in the computer business, and you are able to talk to people from faraway. These are many other reasons but I'm only required to talk about three. First of all, you are able to learn about faraway places you can learn about places you aren't able to see in real life. @CAPS2 is a faster way to get information about news that wouldn't be able to get out on the newspaper until the next day, so you get it right away. If you dont have money to travel then you could just go on the internet and see the faraway places in many ways through images and virtual tours, @CAPS2's just a better source of information for everyone. My second reason is to have a job in the computer business. There are a lot of jobs that require computers to do the work. If we didn't have computers more and more people would not have jobs in these fields. Also, business would be slow because they wouldn't have the information they needed at their fingertips. That is why computers are needed for the economy. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, yes people are able to talk through the phone but its not the same if you get to talk and see the person at the same time. Video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends from anywhere. You can talk to relatives, friends, or anyone you want to talk to without long distance charges. If we didn't have computers you would lose touch with people you know that live faraway from you and that would be hard. That would be a terrible thing to happen to friendships. In conclusion computers are an easier way to get information quickly. You can learn about faraway places you may never visit. You can have a job in the computer business and earn a living. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway and maintain those important relationships, I think computers are a positive thing for our world.
300	300	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, when you look on a map of your effect all you see is computers everywhere. A map of the town shows computers everywhere, the state, the country, and even the world all you see are computers everywhere. We need to shut down these computers so we can start exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with our families. It's time to finally help the world soldiers. Men, when you look around what do you see. Nothing but obesity. These so called computers are causing this, why, just look over there. There's @CAPS5. He used to weigh over @NUM1 pounds. All he did was use that blasted electrical error we call a computer. One day he realized he could do this no longer, and got some exercise. After only a year @CAPS5 just weighed @NUM2 pounds. You see, a man named @PERSON1, who's a doctor, computer expert, and wrote three books on exercise, nature and family, says, ""If people would shut off their computers and use the gym, over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1's obesity would drop."" We must stop the madness men. Soldiers, do you know what's really a shame about the enemy we're fighting? It's causing people to miss out on this beautiful nature. You know @PERSON1 says that over @PERCENT2 of people will never go in nature once they get a computer. They don't know what they're missing out on. I can picture it now the freshly plump berries hanging from the full bush of soaring green. The magnificent waterfall that shines when the light hits it off into a creek. The full dark scenery is simply majestic. Lets not forget the lullaby of the crickets and owls putting you in a deep slumber under the staggering oak trees. This, soldiers, is what we need to get people hooked on not time consuming electronics. Men, do you want to know the saddest part of this war? The hostages of the computer can't even spend time with their families. They're so busy on @CAPS9, @CAPS10, and other death computers that the real things important are left alone. My friend @PERSON2 was one of the captives of the computer. He escaped just in time to stop one of his kids from going to an illegal party. Ever since then, @PERSON2 has put his family before anything. Other families aren't so lucky though. In fact have @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT3 of families with computers have no communication and end up splitting up. The computers have gone too far now. Not only did they mess up people's lives, but their family too. This war must end now. Do you see our future now? It's filled with the computers on top. We're their slaves when we come at their call. They won't let us exercise to get in shape, see the beautiful lands of nature, or spend time with our families so we can keep it together. This is why we're fighting, this is why we're here, will you join us in this crucial battle?"
301	301	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 is all about Computers. They can do anything. But think are they really helping us? Yes, they do research and all of that but physically they're not. You spend less time exercising, interacting with family and friends, and that is the impact that computers can do to @CAPS1 lives in the future. Exercise is necessary in @CAPS1 lives. ""People need to get out there and do something other than be in front of the computer screen"". says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. The fact is one hour of exercise is good for your health. However, two in three @CAPS4 wont do so. Thats why @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on is the way we are @CAPS3 I lazy, unactive worthless and overweight. As a result, computers are the blame. Are there some relatives you been face to face with @CAPS5 its because of computers. Computers @CAPS3 let us do things like video chat with relatives for or go on facebook and myspace or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to chat with them or email. The problem with this is being lazy. You could be out there getting to were your relatives live to see them. but why waste energy going to travel agency when in the internet instead say travel agent @PERSON2. @NUM1 in @NUM2 people havent seen there relatives for other states in years. People need to go outside. Computers @CAPS7 games, @CAPS8 hows all on the computer at the screen. You dont even have to take a step. This is bad, People need do @CAPS11 the old fashoned way. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 @CAPS4 use the computer daily. People lose jobs over computers. Everything is made so simple, theres no need to hire a secretary, as employ and more office personals. Factories, They dont need many people. Computerized @CAPS10 can take over jobs quicker, easier, and cheaper. They will one day take over. Thats not good. In conclusion, Computers @MONTH1 seemed like the best thing that hit earth, but if you really, really think about @CAPS11, @CAPS11's not. @CAPS11 prevents you from exercising, seeing friends and family, and cam impact @CAPS1 lives in a bad way. I hope you see where I'm coming from and understand these concerns."
302	302	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet, also you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly to research and book our plans. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, webchat and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. You can personally see someone from acroos the @ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and @CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Business also use webchatting, as I previously state, for conference calls. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, connect humans with each from half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. @CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?
303	303	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying "",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!"" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, amking many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see. Please understand the meaning how terrible computers are for our society and our well-being."
304	304	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion @CAPS3 as to why some people support advances in technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people is that I disagree. Some people dont even get enough sleep if they stay up too late on computers. Also they spend less time exersizing and less time interacting with family and friends. Thos are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph I am going to tell you about why I think that people should @CAPS4 other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy dont blame them the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer? Well once I stayed at @CAPS1 friends house and she was up on the computer all night she didnt even get any sleep. In the morning she was soo grumpy because she was soo tired. @CAPS1 languege arts teacher ""@PERSON1"" says that ""@CAPS2 up late on the computer all night isnt healthy because you get bugs under your eyes and youre sleepy. I mean theres a whole lot of side effects."" @NUM1 out of @PERCENT1 of parents agree with me and @CAPS1 first reason. In this paragraph I am telling you @CAPS1 second reason as @CAPS3 why I disagree which is less time excersizing. (@CAPS3 the parents) @CAPS4 you realy want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all days or @CAPS4 you want your kids to excersize and get healthier? @CAPS1 friends kids always are on the computer everyday all the time and thats not verry healthy @CAPS3 them especialy because they're young. So a couple of weeks ago I talked to them about being active and how its not good to be on the computer alot. Now they bearly go on the computer they always are outside and playing and running around. @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON3 says that ""@CAPS5 excersize is better than doing anything non active also it can be fun. @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. In this paragraph I am going to explain to you why I think interacting with family and friends is better than on the computer. If you were in your familys shoes @CAPS4 you think that they would rather have you come hang out with them or be on the computer? When I was younger @CAPS1 family used to have to yell at me to get me off the computer so I could hang out with them but finaly a day come when I got to understand their family pain. @CAPS1 mom says that ""I should hang out with @CAPS1 family and friends more often."" @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 conclusion I disagree with the statement ""Some people support advances and technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people."" @CAPS1 reason as @CAPS3 why is that people arent @CAPS5 enough sleep, less time excersizing, and less time interacting with friends and family, which are all vital for a healthy life."
305	305	1	3	"Computers, a very much talked about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and ""I.M.'s"", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""world of warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for"
306	306	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are important for growth. They teach us skills like hand-eye coordination, they allow you to talk online, and learn about faraway people and places. I do believe that it benefits society even though many people dont. Nine out of ten schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine. I know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teamate passes the ball to him and he can't catch it because he has no hand-eye coordination skills. That wouldnt happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball or other skill-based games, that help build that up. When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination. Eight out of ten people keep in touch with family or friends online. Its the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better and they tell you things that they dont want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Lets say you want to know about someone famous, you look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doing anyone good. Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We dont want our society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to further our education or not? We must find a balance to harness their benefits without losing our personal connections.
307	307	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, This world is filled with electronics. These days the computer is the latest hit. But even though it's popular, is it really the best item to have? Many children and even adults are hooked onto the computer. It is taking away their life. Four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play. That's not how you should spend your life. We all want our children to be active and healthy, not be a couch potato. Each day, more kids are getting addicted to the computer. Now, every time a parent needs to punish or ""ground"" their child, they take away the electronics. What ever happened to grounding them from going to hang out with their friends or just playing outside? Another horrifying conclusion that the computer does to us is rip apart us from our loved ones. Kids are more worried about their online games or social media than spending time with their family. They would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever. This computer is splittling families apart. Now, more families only spend time with each other when they eat dinner together. Also, rather than talking to their parents about a problem, kids are going to websites for advice. More people don't enjoy doing some things now because of the computer. Not many like going out and enjoying nature. Some don't like reading anymore because they rather play games. Some people don't even want to pick up the phone and call for a pizza. Also people who look for jobs don't go to the newspaper anymore; they go to the internet! The world is revolving around electronics. We need to end this before our kids or grandchildren start getting out of shape and start relying on the comuter for everything. Do we really wan't to destroy this world and lose bonding with our families? I say, make life better and get rid of computers before they consume all our time and relationships."
308	308	1	3	I think computers are good because if you need to remember stuff all you have to do is just look at your email and you will remember what you have to do and also it is good if you are lost all you have to do is look at the map quickly. If you need to finish a school project you could do it on the computer by looking for the website of the project, if you need to check a website about anything important you could just type the website down and it will show up on the computer and if your child don't have nothing to do they could play games including math games, educational games, and also they could look for knock knock jokes. This makes computers a very helpful tool for both work and fun, providing quick answers and entertainment right at your fingertips whenever you need them.
309	309	1	3	Dear Editor, With all the talk about computers these days I would have to agree with the people who think its taking up alot more of our time. I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family. Why do you think the obesity is so high these days? Well theres one of the reasons and I know when my parents were kids that they had no computers and they went outside to enjoy nature. Computers have there ups and downs but I do not think they benifit out society, first reason being, computers are taking away time to be with our friends and family. I rember when facebook and other sites werent created those were the days when people actually did fun things with there friends and family. there was a recent study that snowed since the 1990s a large percentage of all americans use computers more than a few hours a day for all sorts of diffrent reasons. I think mainiy computers were invented to make reason easier but now adays all we use them for is social networking. My second biggest point as to why computers do not benifit our is because over the past ten years the obesity rate has gone up by a significant amount and due to what cause? eating un healthy food and sitting in front of your computers all day not exersiing. I am almost completely sure that if people stoped using computers that our world would be a healthier place. dont you feel bad for those people who are stuck being ovwrsized for there whole life because of these habits? I think most people would feel bad. My last reason is that we have this ahmazing planet that no one seems to enjoy anymore becaus they use up all there time on computers if only people got out every once and a while they would relize they have been wasting where time. there been a recent study that says over half of people are inside doing nothing all day! thats more than half!! I hope this will change somtim soon because computers hace only created a nusence to people and now it seems like no one has any type of a life. computers hace spread to all sorts ofs societys but please let it not take over this friendly town of ours.
310	310	1	3	Dear Editor, In a pole conducted by a major organization a significant percentage of people agreed that computers are a easier way to research than going to a library. Over the past few years it has become a growing debate as to wheather computers are a benifit to socity or not. Today in america over a majority of all people own a computer, according to the data are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary. Communication is a vital part of america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. Modern computers provide better and faster communication. They are also far more reliable. In the past if you wanted to speech with some one who is far away you would have to send a letter. Along with sending a letter is the risks that it will not get there. it will be stolen in the mail and of course the time that it would take to ge there. All these problems are solved in todays email and instant messiging, which are relible, cant be stolen, and can go across the globe in seconds. Computers are not only a way for communication but also one of the most prominate ways to research, without the internet people would need to go to the library and run the risk of the book not being there or the library being closed. Through the internet all the information in the world is available instantly. Computers are also the former in todays technological advances. Computers allow us to have inventions that run there self so human operation is not nessisary. this same technology saves lives every day and alows us to create even better technology. As you can see computers are the greatest technology created in the modern era and allows faster and more relible communication, is the greatest library the world has ever known, and allows for the creation of even more advanced technologies. Computers are an extreme benifit to socity and nessisary in this current era of global connection and information.
311	311	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, I think that computers are beneficial for everyone. First of all, you can learn about places that are around the world in a single click. Also, you can communicate with friends and family who live far away. Finally, it makes your life so much easier by simplifying daily tasks. Here are some reasons why you should get a computer for your family. First, you can learn about things you didn't even know were real, in an instant. You can learn about ancient civilizations, different cultures, and different recipes for tonight's dinner. You can get help in school work also. If you need to learn about the history of a distant country, all you have to do is type it in. If you need to learn your multiplication table, you type it in and it will show up in a matter of seconds. The internet is excellent for searching up all types of things. Secondly, you can talk to your family members and friends on the internet. I've heard a lot of people saying people need to spend more time with their family. So on the computer you can talk to someone in another state, and everywhere else. It's like a pen pal but you don't waste money buying envelopes and stamps to send a letter. Computers cost a lot of money but it is worth it. You can do almost everything on the computer. Lastly, if you get a computer it makes your life so much easier. Instead of going to the library and getting a cook book, you can type in dinner recipes for chicken. Your computer will come up with hundreds of different ways to make a delicious chicken for dinner. You can tell a friend that you can't make it to their party. Also, it can help teach you homework that you did not understand. If you buy a computer your life would be more relaxing. In conclusion, you should buy a computer. If you do you will learn so many things. It's like having a book with everything you will ever need or want to know. This is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time.
312	312	1	3	Dear readers, I think the use of computers are good, here are some reasons why? My first reason is you can find stuff online. My second reason is you can have fun. My last reason is you can make new friends. I will write several paragraphs explaining my reasons. Going back to my introduction my first reason was you can find stuff online. If you can't find a job you can go online and find some opportunities. If you want to go to college but you have no time you can take classes online from your home. Those are my details to support my reason. My second reason was the computers are so fun. To me they are fun because when you are bored you can play games. If you are not a game person you can play surveys or quizzes. Or you can find out interesting facts and trivia. That is how I can back up my second reason. My third reason was you can meet new people. You can meet new people by searching them up if you are trying to find an old friend. Or there is social networking such as Myspace, Facebook, Twitter etc which you can use to meet new people. Mostly everyone would like to meet new people and make connections. To end this story my first reason was you can find stuff online, my second reason was you can have fun. My last reason was you can meet new people from all over.
313	314	1	3	"I believe computers aren't having a positive effect on people in this time period for some people they’ve really taken over their lives. There are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers. Also there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you're addicted to Facebook. Also money will always be less when computers come along! Computers can really be dangerous to your health! For example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run. Did you know, more seizures are induced by computers than by other factors? A prominent doctor is saying ""People don't cause obesity, computers do"" and he also thinks that the majority of the obesity is caused by an addiction to computer games. Ever been depressed then taken a long nature walk, and felt great? Well a lot of people tell on rely on their computer when they're down. Computers usually make things worse. When on Twitter, Facebook, Google and YouTube all the time its hard to find time for even the most important things. For example if you're a parent your child might feel abandoned if you start caring about the computer more than them; very little time spent together could turn them to alcohol or smoking. I bet you never thought of a computer like that! Computer can be good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction there when you're addicted to sitting on a computer you forget about the beauty of nature! Money can also contribute to the addiction. For example shopping addictions are a good way to blow money because it's so easy. All you have to do is type in a credit card number which gives you the illusion that you're not spending money, until the bill comes! Another thing is kids websites which you need to pay for; you also need to pay for internet and the electricity bill. It's clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems, less time in your daily schedule and the money out of you pocket. To me computers are just a trouble in our lives and we must be cautious with their use."
314	315	1	3	Newspaper and Readers, Computers are a very large part of our lives and society. However, there are still people who think that computers do harm. Actually there are many positive effects that computers have on people. Among those effects are ease of communication, ease of gathering information, and ease of finding entertainment. Computers have far more positive than negative effects. Computers have made communication easy for people. There are so many different means of communication using the computer, which are all free. For example, instant messaging, email, video chat, chat rooms, and other social networking sites, are all there and help you communicate with friends and family. The positive effect that this has on people is that it allows them to stay in touch with people whom they might not otherwise due to financial or convenience issues. Being social is healthy for people and therefore communication is a positive effect of computers. Information is far easier to acquire when a computer is used. For example, if a kid needed to know about the climate of a region for his social studies project, instead of having to get in his mom's car, drive all the way to the town library, spent time looking for the book, he could just log on to the internet and go from there. This is a positive effect on him because it saves him some time and effort. Furthermore much more useful information can be found on the internet as well, such as: flight times, prices, restaurants, stocks, weather, news, and basically any fact that you need to know. All of these things make having a computer a very positive thing in somebody's life. Computers are a great source of entertainment. In this economy, I know we all could benefit from not having to pay rental fees for movies and big prices for video games. Internet gaming is very amusing and you can find many good games for free. In addition to that, there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer. These things are a great solution to the rising cost of entertainment. Saving money and enjoying good entertainment are both positive effects on people, and both offered by computers. I hope now that readers of this newspaper will now understand how good computers are next time you are looking for a late fee on a library book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer have offered an alternative that is both convenient and cost-effective.
315	316	1	3	To whom it may concern, Computers are beneficial to society. They promote learning, coordination, and even general welfare. It is true that computers can be detrimental to a person's health, affecting the amount of exercise and interaction a person gets, but the positive effects of computers more than make up for this. People learn much of what they know from the computer. Among an infinite number of things a person can learn from them are definitions of new words, scientific theories, algebraic equations, history, law, any number of languages, and much more. Computers, when used for learning, can teach people things they might not learn in school, but on their own time, computers exercise the brain, and teach it to think beyond the boundaries of a standard classroom. They also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face its needs. Coordination can be very hard for some people, and this can be a problem. Without coordination, people wouldn't be able to catch a ball, avoid certain dangers, or even stand. To help improve this people need practice. They can get this practice from exercise like catching a ball, threading a needle, or using a computer. Using the mouse on a computer can help with hand-eye coordination in that it forces the brain to direct the mouse to a certain place on the screen, in order to accomplish what is needed to be done. At first, this process can be excruciatingly slow, but over time, as the brain gets practice, this coordination improves and the process speeds up significantly, the person will be able to use the computer faster and more efficiently. This will help them play games, learn, or even help people when they are in need. Helping people is very important in this day and age. That's why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help. Computers allow this. For example, on the day of the deadly earthquake in a affected region, most of the world found out within the hour from computers. News sites broadcast it, social networking sites talked about it, and people talked to each other online about it. This rapid spread of the news saved many lives as people immediately dropped what they were doing and rushed to help. Computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people. Many websites also are adept at donating money while playing a game. For example, some sites donate grains of rice for every question answered correctly, and they have donated over a billion grains of rice. Obviously, computers and sites like these have to have a positive effect on the world. Overall, one would think that computers have a mostly positive effect on the world. Despite limiting exercise, they encourage learning, and the exercise of the brain. Computers also help people with their coordination, which is very important. Finally, computers promote a world where people want to help each other, and a world where people keep up with current events, whether they like it or not. Thank you, editor, for considering my side on the positive effects computers have on the world and its people.
316	317	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do people benefit from the use of computers. Some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing. I personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, help people learn, and allow people to communicate with others. The use of computers teach hand-eye cordination and reaction time. Some say that being outside and exercising is better than using a computer but many computer games help hand-eye cordination. Alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important. These skills could help you in the activities you take part in and every - day life, personally, I play a lot of @CAPS3 @NUM1, a computer gaming system. @CAPS3 has helped ny hand-eye cordination greatly and it has shown in the four sports that I play. Clearly, Computers can be very helpful and can help your hand - eye cordination. Computers can also help people learn in many ways. There is a lot of content on the internet that simply can't be in school. The ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part in learning as a student. I use the internet nearily every night to type my papers and find the information that I need. It has helped one as a student. Also, typing papers on computers is becoming the new @CAPS4 of hand writting. Teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed. Documents can be saved do that they cannot be lost inlike a hard copy written by hand. Although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time, it can also help you stay organized. Many people have calenders in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule. Your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved. Computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes. We can communicate with others using computers. People use computer technology to communicate everyday through @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I-chat. If I need to know what our homework is or when practic is I use my computer to ask someone for the answer. Before I began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do. Although many disagree with using computer technology, computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries. When something happens overseas the first way we found out about it is a computer. It is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. Clearly computers are importan for communication purposes, we must continue to use computers for multiple reasons. Although many disagree with the use of computers, there hand - eye, communications, and learning purposes are very important. Without computer technology we would function much differently. It is up to you to continue using computers.
317	318	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2ít you think computers help society? I do I strongly belive computers help society and are being used for very good purposes. They help people of all ages. Its easyer for kids to look up information for @CAPS3, gives kids some good facts to help build knowlege and not only would it help kids but it will help adults too. Its easy to see why adults think kids dont read enough however kids get more than enough reading done on the computer. some parent think that just because kids arent going to the library to take a book out for their report they arent gaining knowlege but they are gaining knowlege because all of the things they could look up in a library they have availible to them on the computer. Computers help kids around the world find thing quickly and easily. Not only does the computer give them knowlege of things that happen in the past but also things happening in current times. It can also give kid information like weather updates that help to keep then safe. Over @PERCENT1 of the things you can find at the library you can finf on the computer. Some parents think that kids arent getting enough exencise but never the less they are also skiping out on a lot of knowlege and important facts also. On the computer you pick up a lot of facts such as wether updates natural desasters how to help others in need and other very important facts. If it was't for computers kids would not make up for all the knowlege they miss in school. on make up for what they miss when they are dosent. Computers help people everywhere gain knowlege. Not only have computers helped kid but they also help adults. They can do work over the computer look at houses, cars and lots of other important things. Certenly @CAPS1 you would not want to take away all of things knowlege and help being given to hot kids and adult on the computer. It helps aldults especialy keep thing going in there baissy lives. It also helps than make changes such as how they eat or act @CAPS4 are some reasons penale should not disaprove of computers because they help kids with @CAPS3, give kid important facts and, help people of all ages. sarely some of @CAPS4 facts could helpchange, and improve lives for the better.
318	319	1	3	Computers definitely have a positive impact on society. They help organize your thoughts, which reduces stress. So, they contain many inspirational articles which can convince kids to strive for surless. Lastly, when all else fails, the computer can be a great way to relax and clear your mind. Computers help organize your thoughts, which helps reduce stress. Imagine you working on a project in school. Everybody can add to it, and you can selectively choose which additions you want. In addition, you @MONTH1 also block the programs that you don't want. This device is called the computer, and it's changed @LOCATION1's society for the better. On average, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 suffer from stress. Now if you organize your thoughts on the computer, and are able to look through them again at why a huge alleviated. Instead of worrying thoughts you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not remember, you now have confidence that you can look back and find your thoughts right on your @CAPS2. Reduced stress trading to confidence effect on society. Also, the computer contains articles that @MONTH1 insure our children to strive for their goals. Once child read an article @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 book. As an @NUM3 using @PERSON1 as well in school. By games, I observe how into @CAPS3 since I started seeing @PERSON1 as role model to me, high making a stride for a @CAPS4.O @CAPS5. Where did this inspiration come from? Researching @PERSON1 on the internet. The internet, in this instance, obviously had a positive impact on @CAPS6 society. Lastly, when all else fails, you can rely on the computer to make stressful situations seem less overwhelming. If you have the ability to solve a problem, then why can't you solve it? Often times, the answer to this question is that the situation is too overwhelming. If you take a break go on you @MONTH1 relax simple games put out a variety of websites. Now say you came back and attack the problem again. You continually chip away at it, and it seems overwhelming. Thank you computer gods! The computer, in this instance, has made - positive impact an @CAPS6 society. So as you can tell, computers make a strong, positive impact on @CAPS6 society.
319	320	1	3	Dear editor of the @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion I think people are spending to much time on technology because their is many people I know who stay on technology and don't even do work. Also, spending to much time on the computers and others things then taking time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People who stay to close to there technology will be addicted to it and they will start to kill brain cells. Some times people get locked because to much information was given out or you did somthing that you were'nt suppose to do. Downloading certain things also bring harm to your computer like viruses that can crash downthe computer hard drive and system. There are many good and bad thing about being on a computer like the bad things stalkers, hackers, seizers, blindness. Then the good thing about being on a computer is it teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, even allow people to talk online with other like friends or family. In my life it helps a little because I play lots of army games so when I go out with my cousins and friends we go label tagging in a sports complex and I use the same tactics that i learn to beat the other teams. It hurts some people eye site when all their doing is stairring durectly at eh screen. one experience was like @NUM1 months ago the last time I stayed at my aunts house all my cousins do was stay on th ga me till they have to take a bath, clean and eat, They didn't even go to sleep till eight in the @TIME1. Some parents should at least give an hour a day to say he game. For me I only go on the computer for like twenty minutes then log and go back online later on in the day. It is important to find a healthy balance between technology use and other life activities.
320	321	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on man kind. So many great discoveries and great topics have been found on the compture, studees have shown <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of famous in the united states has at least one computer in there house holds. There a great way look up important information withoout going to the and searching for hours, to contract others, and lets face it they make our a life a whole lot easier. Imagine this! your stressed and on edge you have just @NUM2 hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay. You have a pounding head ache and just want to quit, your probably in the libary reading through hundreds of books. Now imagine you being at home sprawled across your lap, all it takes is a few taps on your keyboard and bam! Instant information. Now how easy was that, thats one of the great impacts computer have made on us, humanity. Computers are terrific to learn things with a fast pase to it. I personally have used computers to @CAPS2 advantage you logon go to google type the subject of knowledge and its just like you have a personal teacher in your own home. A local study has been underway the have a groups, @CAPS6 A which has a libary full of books and @CAPS6 @CAPS3 a @CAPS6 with a @CAPS4 @CAPS5, The scientist gave them all the same essays, @CAPS6 @CAPS3 <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of student have passed with flying colars while @CAPS6 A <@PERCENT1@NUM4> passed with a @CAPS9 or higher. Thats important because higher grades, means higher test scores. higher test scores equal fundimg. I think computers are the best invention and is not imparing humans its evolving them. Imagine this! your sitting at home crying because your special other has moved far away from you well computers are a great way to reconect with that person. Computers have software were you can instant message, send emails, or even video chat with that person. For even some business man its an way to have meetings without flying @NUM5 miles. I have @NUM2 aunts that I cannot live without who are @CAPS2 strong base who I cant live without talking to for a day. Without computers I dont know what I would do. Scientist tool surveys that @PERCENT1 to the @CAPS10.S.A has family in other states, countries, or even contents, hey have to have some way to be in contact. @CAPS2 last reason is I know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier. Some jobs that have opened up giving unwadged citizens a sorce of income on computers. <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of jobs relay on computers. Imagine a chasier counting all the money, a banker having to take time counting one by one other peoples cash, a telemarketer calling with no way of information. All these ways and more that computers have impacted us. Now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability, contracting others, and last but NOT least made me and yours life better. Computers are a terrific way for human to adap to the fast life and will continue to be essential for future progress.
321	322	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe the computer has a positive effect on people. It helps students with projects, helps people learn about other places, and it helps you find information on something you didn't know. A significant percentage of all teachers give out computer projects. Most reading teachers will have you read a book and then type an essay or a review about your book. Most teachers prefer the essay typed and not written. By the teacher giving that assignment he/she is giving the student the ability to explore outside of always writing. And I believe other students would agree with me, it is better to type the essay than to write it! Is there a place out there that you really want to know more about, that you hope to someday visit? Well you can always use the computer to find out more about the place. You can use the computer to learn when is the best times to visit that place. Furthermore, if you just heard on the news about a tragic accident like the earthquake over in Japan, and you want to keep in touch on what is happening in that place you can use the computer. The computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday. I'm sure almost every person has read a book and came across a word they did not know or a student had spelling words that they didn't know what the words meant. Well you can use the computer to look up the words. The computer will give you the full definition and how to pronounce the word. Computers will help you find any information you need, and it does so quickly! In conclusion computers aren't just a thing that kids play on all day it helps you with many things like getting your work done, finding out about places, and finding out information about things you need to know, and that is very helpful.
322	323	1	3	Dear Editor, I feel as though computers have good effects on people. Throughout these next paragraphs I will be giving you all of my reasons on the things that computers help people do. I will be talking about how computers give people good typing skills, how they give information to people, and how they allow us to socialize. Over ninety four percent of people today own a computer and feel as though they have learned many things from it. I bet you didn't know that! First off I will be telling you about how computers help people type. The keyboard on a computer doesn't go alphabetically. This means that you have to practice more to get better in typing. I remember the first time I tried to use the keyboard it was difficult but as I tried more I got better. Once I got better I realized where the keys were and soon I didn't even have to look. The computer and all of it's parts help people by teaching them skills that they can use in their daily lives. These skills may be needed in their job field. Computers are a helpful device. The next thing I will be telling you about is how computers have information that is useful to everyone. It holds information and has websites on the internet. My final reason why computers have a good effect is how they help us socialize. If you need to talk to a friend but don't feel like calling them you can just go on to a website and chat with them. There are so many that you just can't choose! Did you know that there are over one million of these kinds of websites? There is Facebook and Twitter just to name a few. This also gives people the chance to socialize with people from all over the world. This in return causes people to have better social skills. Maybe they will become more friendly and become more outgoing. This is all because of one little thing and that little thing is the computer! So as you can see computers have many wonderful effects on people. They help people get better at typing, give lots of information that people want to know, and help them get better social skills. Thanks for reading this and taking in the information I have shared.
323	324	1	3	I think computers have shaped our society to what it is today. Computers help people learn, give people a pastime, and all of that can be managed in a certain space of time so you still have time to go outside. Computers help everyone learn. It makes things easier by typing up essays because you could type it faster and it's easier to make changes. Also, it's cheaper to buy a computer and go on the internet and look up foreign countries than actually going there. Another example, is that a computer teaches you hand-eye coordination from typing and using the mouse. Finally, computers can teach you life lessons by reading articles another person wrote. Computers give bored people pastimes. One example, is that you can play computer games during rainy days or when you can't go outside. Also, you can talk to friends through Facebook or AIM. Another example, is that you can talk to distant family in another country by using programs such as Skype. Finally, you can order stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store and the things you might order you can play with outside. A lot of people say computers keep kids inside but don't know that there are ways to prevent this. One example is you can use shut-off timers that keep anyone from going onto the computer for too long. Also, many people learn how to manage their time on the computer. Another example, is that parents can make rules that their children aren't allowed to play games on the computer on certain days and/or times. Finally, you can keep the computers in the family room so that children don't play with it all night in their room. Those are just some of the many reasons why computers help us. They help us learn, pass the time, and it can all be managed during a certain amount of time. Now reading this I hope you believe that computers benefit society in many positive ways.
324	325	1	3	Dear Editor, In many ways computers are helpful but, I don't support the use of them. The advance in technology has really taken away from peoples lives all over the world, some examples of this are lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time spent with family and friends. Continue reading for more on how computers don't benefit society. As you know, when you use a computer you usually sit in a chair to do so, correct? Well, this activity is doing only one thing, not keeping you healthy or in shape. I'm sure that you want to be healthy, and to be healthy you must get some sort of exercise through out your day, and sitting on the computer is not helping you one bit. So as you can clearly see, so far using computers is not beneficial to our society, continue for more cons of using computers as much as they are used. Believe it or not, using a computers is unhealthy, and not beneficial, in more than one way. The reason for this is because, not only do you not get enough exercise, you won't go outside as much. You may be wondering as to why not going outside is unhealthy, but it is because you don't receive the needed amount of fresh air that you need to not be sick. Could you imagine the amount of people that would be sick if everyone used the computer for the majority of their day? Well, lets just say it wouldn't be fun to count them all. Now that you know two ways that computers are not beneficial to society, keep reading for one last way. As you probably know, it is a hard task to keep a big family close to each other, and using computers isn't going to do anything to help you. So, why use them? Trust me, spending quality time with your family and friends can be just as much, or even more fun than playing your favorite computer games, and in my opinion your family should be the most valuable thing in your life, so don't lose them for a computer. Now that you have finished reading, I would like to thank you for your time reading this letter concerning how lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time with family, shows computers are not beneficial to society.
325	326	1	3	Dear Editor, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students can contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the internet everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Student and employees use software for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Furthermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to our loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through video calls. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families, but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due the next day, but their printer is broken, they can email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not only useful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the internet ten times a day just to get information. Computers provide a plethora of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like Google or Yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the only thing that provides information for eager learners; websites also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the city, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to the jungle, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books may provide a description, but nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly be working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree with this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. On average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation software. These programs allow people to correct spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that a high percentage of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected their mistakes quickly through these programs. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence, thereby improving their skills over time.
326	327	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people. It all depends on your perspective and what type of person you are. You can argue that computers have a very positive effect on people or that they have a very negative effect. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people, but you can't dismiss that by saying I am just a kid who plays on it all the time. While that is true, it can also teach you valuable skills like hand-eye coordination. For @CAPS2, what I am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster, which is a useful ability. Another @CAPS2 is that some people are faster at typing than writing, but some people write faster than they type. Me personally, I am faster at typing than writing. My final reason is that after a hard day at school or work you can come home, play some music, and relax on the computer. It is a good idea to learn how to type fast; for instance, if you are writing a story for school and it is due tomorrow, being a fast typist means you could finish your story in time. This means you should learn how to type faster. Some people prefer to write than type, but other people prefer to type than write. I personally prefer to type than write, but that is just me. Let's say a friend of mine likes to write more than type; that is okay. We will not stop being friends after that; we will just like different things, that is all. This means some people prefer to write than type. This probably happens after a hard day at school or work; you can come home, use the computer to play some music, and relax. You can play all the music you want, as well as do other things at the same time. For @CAPS2, I play music and talk to my friends at the same time. I @CAPS3 use it to do homework, which is very helpful. In conclusion, it is a good idea to keep computers to use. People can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time. Overall, computers have a positive effect on people.
327	328	1	3	What I think about computers benefiting our community is great. Technology has come a long way over the years, and the most important invention is the computer. Most schools now have computers, and the reason is that they benefit society. They are a huge save in paper, which helps the environment. You also learn more things about places @CAPS1 and anything else you can imagine. These reasons support why we need to have computers. Computers benefit our community by saving paper and making our work look neater. We can talk to friends and family easily. The main reason is that it gives computer technicians more jobs, and people need more jobs; computers also provide instant news. Say the mayor needs to send an important message about polluting the water; he can do that quickly through email. The main thing in our society today is going green. The only way we can do that effectively is by switching to computers. We have to chop down so many trees just to get @NUM1 paper to each kid in the grade. Adults should understand we need to conserve paper. Now I know what you're thinking: what if we need to print something? My response is that you could just email it to a teacher, a friend, or anybody else. Kids these days need to learn more about other cultures. We need to know about their economy, and the fastest way we could do that is through the internet. It is so much faster than looking through thousands of books. All you have to do is type the place you want, and boom, there it is. There are many benefits to having a computer; my final reason is it also gives you great hand-eye coordination. And if you want to be an athlete, then you need lots of it. How the computer gives you hand-eye coordination is from typing and moving the mouse around. The best way is to play lots of educational video games. With all the facts and statements I gave you, like benefiting the community, going green, and also learning about other places, please consider my points when you are writing your article.
328	329	1	3	Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to pick being for computers. There are a couple of reasons why I'm for computers, and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn new stuff, and you can also play video games for fun. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to friends online easily. So if you have a Facebook or Myspace account, you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend, they will receive those exact words, and then they'll reply quickly. For example, if you wanted to just say hi, then your friend would look at his or her messages and then just reply. So being able to talk to friends online is one example of why I am for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn new things. So if you wanted to learn a new language, then you would go to Google or something similar and try to find a fast and easy site. What I mean is if you go to Google, a whole bunch of sites will come up, so what you want to do is find the fastest and easiest site for you to use. So being able to learn important things like a language is another reason I'm for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. What I mean is if you were bored and had no one to talk to, then you can get on your computer and play a mind-numbing game or an educational game for class. For example, in science class we played a game on the computer, and it had to do with gravity, which was what we were learning about, so it was an educational game. So that is the last reason why I'm for computers. I'm for computers because you can play games and learn at the same time. So now you know why I'm all for computers; I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff, and play video games.
329	330	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about whether computers have a positive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a positive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including children, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can go onto Facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happened to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's Facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. This guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something bad was going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of the police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away on these websites, and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity it has had on society outweighs @DR1 the good the computer is doing."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that give @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously, and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising, and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on a @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website and do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had a negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on buying the computers and @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family has to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computer. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2; on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computer, but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't go. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of families have wasted their college money on computers because the family thinks they need one. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6 says, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth @CAPS1 your children's safety and future."
330	331	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, A recent study by scientists shows that too much sitting down, especially in front of computers, is dangerous to your health. This is only one reason why I think that, although they are useful, computers are not entirely beneficial to our society. They hinder us from exercising, interacting with nature, and spending time with family and friends. Exercising, as we all know, is necessary to remain a fit and healthy human being. But how is this possible with some people going to work every day and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day long? Too much computer time, even for kids, can lead to obesity and overweightness. Also, like I mentioned before, scientists have concluded that too much sitting is bad for you; it isn't how the body was built to work. If you have seen WALL-E, one of @ORGANIZATION1's most recent movies, you understand it is easy. The humans in that movie, after relying on computers for so long, became obese and fat and had no muscle. This is an exaggeration, of course, but minor visions of this are going around the world. Going outside to do activities instead of sitting at a computer is a sure way to be healthy. The next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature. Even simulations don't cut it; if you wanted to see a frog or some other animal, you can't just @ORGANIZATION2 it, you have to look for it in the real world. Developing a connection to nature can really nurture the soul and is fulfilling. Instead of exploring a computer, explore the world as we know it before it's too late or you're too old. Learn how to do something by doing it yourself. Instead of hiring someone to make something, make it yourself. Do it to learn it; don't just sit at a computer website to hire someone! Get up and get outside! As you become more dependent on your computer, you become less dependent on family and friends. It causes a rift between family members. Your family might not be able to help you when you're in need. If you're an adult, and you're on the computer all the time for something other than work, then you're not supporting your family; you have no income, no life, and no future. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Imagine this: You have nothing except your laptop. You're alone and have no family relations. Nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets! You have nobody and nothing except for your computer, and you've wasted your life away. Too much time on your computer means that everyone suffers. To sum it all up, computers may be useful, but every single cloud has a dark lining. Computers stop us from exercising, interacting with nature, and being with our families. So get outside and live your life!
331	332	1	3	"Imagine a world without computers; chaos in war, even the clutter on your desk would be overwhelming. The chat you're having with your best friend on AIM wouldn't be happening. The report on the library might not get done because all the books were checked out; in fact, we wouldn't have NASA or any space program without computers. I know if this happened I wouldn't be happy. Companies almost completely rely on technology; you can't just send a letter and have it arrive at the office in five minutes. Communication through the computer is very popular. A significant percentage of the world uses AIM or another chat service; in a study done by a university professor, a notable number out of every student doesn't talk to family on an AIM service. A quote from the professor said, ""It is a good thing to stay in touch with their families as well as keeping up to date on current events."" If computers are taken away, information is gone. It's all lost in some pile of papers. One time my computer crashed and I had a report due but all the books were gone. That report was done late when they were fixed. Now thanks to the new computer system, we are much more organized and NASA is running rovers on Mars. NASA runs completely by computers. Look what they have given us today. A large portion of all household appliances come from NASA's work. A comment from NASA implied, ""There would be no cars or phones without us, their computers too."" And that's true; are they going to take away cars and phones as well? We need you, the people, to decide. The people who made this country what it is today must decide if you think we shouldn't have computers. I don't, and neither should you."
332	333	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a lot of effects on people. Some effects are that it takes away from family and friends, you don't really have a social life, and you don't get enough exercise. Computers take away from friends and family time. I did an interview yesterday with a local teenager; and I asked, ""When you go over your grandma's house what do you usually do?"" The teenager said, ""I usually use the computer."" But why do you want to use the computer while you're there? You're with your family; you're supposed to spend time with them. Play a game like Monopoly, or play cards. Those are fun and a great way to interact with your family. If your family member doesn't have those games, bring them! People think that because there is Facebook, AIM, e-mail, and Myspace that you're interacting with friends. You really aren't. I asked my friend what they thought of those things and they said ""They are great interacting websites."" They really aren't. They are just websites on the computer. While you are on the computer you're not really maintaining a social life. Your town holds activities or has a fun place you could go to. Your town likely has a gym, community center, or a library. Go there and hang out with friends; interact with them. Going to school, going to the library, and hanging out with friends are great ways to interact with people. People don't think about the fact that you're sitting in your computer chair and not moving. While you're sitting in the chair you're not exercising, and if you keep sitting there you're gaining weight. You might get fatter because you're stuffing your face with Cheez-Its and not exercising. I asked another person a question; it was what do you do while you're on the computer? They said ""I eat.."" Eating isn't bad, but if you're not really paying attention you eat more than you need. Your town has rec leagues of sports such as soccer, softball, and baseball. Join a team instead of playing on the computer and snacking. Get active! Computers aren't the greatest things in the world. You don't stay fit with them, you aren't very social, and you don't really spend time with your family. Computers don't really help you grow up and be mature for the future."
333	334	1	3	To the School Board, The use of computers per family has increased greatly in the past ten years. In that same time, people are getting fatter and they need more exercise. If you use the computer it might break or not work properly. Computers are a big waste of time and a bigger waste of money. In the past decade, many people have gained a lot of weight. They do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online. Studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat than if you shop on line. Another reason why computers don't give you exercise is because of Google. If you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to Google and type it in. It is a much easier way to see sights, but if you walk you could burn up to several times as many calories then if you just look it up. Another reason is you can get addicted to a game. Let's say that you have basketball practice at four o'clock. If you go on the computer at three then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice. You would be stuck on your computer mindlessly typing away on a computer game that doesn't help you anywhere in life. When you don't go to practice you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight. Scientists say that if you actually play a sport you can lose a significant amount of weight compared to if you didn't. Before there were computers, life was simple; no student forgot their homework. But now they use their computer, and many things can go wrong. First, the printer can break. Last year my printer stopped working multiple times so I could not do my homework. My teacher said that forgetting my homework affected my grade by over a letter grade. Another reason why handwriting is more convenient is you are capable of doing writing during school. Last year with my teacher, I had to write a prompt. She told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken. When I got downstairs she told me I had to write it so I got a low grade because she could not read what I wrote. Every other kid got a higher grade, but since I was not use to writing it affected my grade. Another reason why computers are inconvenient is when you need to do research. My parent got rid of our books a while ago because of computers. So one day when I was home alone I had to research a topic on the computer but there was a power outage. I could not do my science project so I got a poor grade on it. That grade brought my average down from an A+ to an A-. The only reason I got a bad grade is because I depended on the computer for research and it let me down. If I had better handwriting I would have gotten a better grade. The final reason is because they are a waste of money. Most computers cost a lot for the computer and installing. There is no need for them because everything computers have, a library can give. The library has books so you can research with books instead of computers. In my house, several people in my family have a computer but few of the computers are used once a week. They are extremely expensive and there is no need for them. Also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overcharging by a considerable margin. With that extra money you could buy many books and magazines instead of a computer. That is why computers are not useful. People are not getting exercise, so they gain more weight. It is much less convenient than writing by hand. Finally, they are a major waste of money. The decades without computers were much more useful and everyone lived happier.
334	335	1	3	Dear City Council, I was unsure if I was with or against people using computers. But I thought about it and I decided that I was against using computers. For the same reasons: safety stops education, and sites that are not appropriate to see. I know many people think how come using a computer is not safe. Well, even though you are not talking to someone in person and only on the computer, what you do over the computer is not safe. The reason why is because most of the time there would be someone that's thirty and we be like thirteen, and I use those ages because kids my age be the main one on sites like Myspace, but he can be like thirty and we be like thirteen and us not knowing he comes on Myspace or puts another picture up there of a young person did we start thinking to meet up and something bad happened. For example, my friend who was on Myspace was talking to a forty-one year old and then they met up but she did not know his real age and she was assaulted. Not everybody is true over the computer. Education is very important even for adults and children. Being on the computer is not going to bring our education up; it is going to bring it down. The reason why this is, is most kids come home from school, put their bookbag down, eat, and then go straight on Myspace, or other sites instead of studying, reading, or doing their homework. Even though those websites do help you learn, but only about things like reading messages or looking at people's comments. Like for example, I would go on and instead of me learning new information, I am just being and learning gossip. Learning brings achievement; a computer brings not succeeding. There is not much I can say about sites that are not appropriate; all I can say is watch what you go on and see on Myspace cause you might just run into something you are not supposed to, such as a story about an assault that went on. Be careful with what you do online.
335	336	1	3	"Dear Editor, ""Teen at Local School killed in a horrific accident"" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be a few minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this issue brings up many conflicts; as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of peoples' lives. When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem ""too good to be true."" If you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, a surprising number of people have been scammed some time in their life. I can clearly remember when someone I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later that day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who may not know any better at risks. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. In addition, computers steal much of peoples' time to the point where family, doing homework and exercising is limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it everyday with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed aside. The only words from his mouth are, ""Please, just one more game!"" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game turns into two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are updating status or pictures on social media for three hours every night. Isn't there a point where we can draw the line between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed, the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue. Computers take away peoples' free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers; but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that there are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices can bring. Computers can harm relationships, finances and your personal life more than you would think."
336	337	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 well @CAPS1 many others, i believe computers are not only good, but beneficial. Computers are advanced our world little by little every day. We all use them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge. Computers are like people with fun to do and things to learn. Computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide. Computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday. It used to be old letters by mail, then it became e-mails, twitter, and facebook. These websites upgrage communication today. Long distance friends can view photos, information, videos, and chat from far away. Some site like @ORGANIZATION2 allow you to instant message your friends. Lastly, video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person. According to @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 more user signed up for web-cams since the beggining of @DATE1. Communication is positively affected by computers. I know you @MONTH1 have fun with sports or nature, but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly. Computer games only cost about @MONEY1 and are instant access. Also, surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes. Almost everyone who has a @CAPS2 gets a blast surfing the internet. Do you ever wonder how to hear the song you like when it's not on the radio? Itunes stores, organize, and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access. What also happens is youtube allows you to watch music videos or hear songs for free. Now thats why computers are straight entertainment. Finally, computers provide you with so much knowledge and is great for education. Certain websites let you access tons of knowledge. Wikipedia and diccionary.com are great for learning new facts and definitions. With these tools, learning becomes easier and more accessible for everyone, making computers an invaluable resource in our modern world.
337	338	1	3	Dear, local Newspaper @CAPS1 I read the article and I think that you guys are right because in the @DATE1 kids rather stay inside on the computer. @CAPS1 who know's what they do @CAPS1 some kids are on facebook all day some are on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. Sometimes kids dont even like to go do exercises they stay on the computer eating & eating. I think if their was no technology kids these days wont be beast. Some kids dont even like hanging out with their friends or family they say that they want to stay home on the computer but we should do more, exercises than being on the computer. If were always on the computer we wont learn nothing at school because when were at school kids could be thinking about going home to go on the computer and you wont focused on our education @CAPS1. And what if kids drop out or dont come to school anymore because they to be chatting with their friends or a stranger. What if a girl didn't want to go to school and on her computer. What if she is talking to a stranger computers so kids can just go and do some exersis instead of being on the computer and wont be a beast anymore. It is clear that we need to encourage a healthier balance for the well-being of our children.
338	339	1	3	Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 a ìhome on your town; all you hear is, ìmom, mom , mom drive me to the library to get booksî. You see many residents just dying to go to foreign countries but have no money. Is this what you want every home to start looking like? Computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another. You can learn about places youíve always wanted to go to and it is probably the device that makes your life easiest. For these reasons computers are what benefits society most. First of all, computers let friends and family talk without spending a nickel. I know I have relatives who are too poor to pay the high costs of phone bills that come their way when we need to talk this means that not everyone can afford talking on a phone, but a computer costs nothing to use. Also, in the @ORGANIZATION3 issue @NUM1, @DATE1 @NUM2 a recent poll showed that @PERCENT1 of people who own computer use it to talk instead of on a phone. I know some people say that computers are too time consuming, but if this many people use computers to talk, thereís no need to worry about paying phonebills. Also, @PERSON1 a @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION4 says that less people needed a loan when the computer came out with instant messaging and video chatting. This shows that friends and families stopped paying massive phonebills and just talked online. Furthermore, just from using a computer anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the @LOCATION1. Whatís more is that they can be in the bedroom or room. A boy name @CAPS3 @PERSON4 who attends @ORGANIZATION1 said that he always wanted to go to when he was little and was as when he looked up @LOCATION2 and facts and pictures on the web. Also, @PERSON3 a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 @ORGANIZATION1 task a poll asking how many students did projects having to do with foreign countries and @PERCENT2 of them they did. That means that so many people need to resourced foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it. It shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands. Last but not least, computers are just about the convenient thing to have in a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT3 at people would rather have a computer than a car that just shows the important computers are. Also, I used to think computers were bad for you and everything, but when I received one for my @NUM3 birthday, I found out how useful they were. Many people say computers are time comsuming because they havenít used one yet. Also did you know that million people use a computer thatís more than half their population and such a poor country? That shows her important computers are and how convenient. All and all, now @CAPS1 have if happy residents, laughing on the computer they do because computers allow them to talk with friends learn and visit foreign countries and are so convenient @PERSON2 and readers computers withour a doubt benefit society.
339	340	1	3	Computers, More and more people are using them. They are used to talk, for lesieure and many other things. But are computers a good thing? Computers can be a very good thing to have around. Besides practically unlimited information, you can stay in touch with your family using @ORGANIZATION1. You can use @ORGANIZATION2 word to make documents and powerpoint presentations that organize your ideas. Also you can use @ORGANIZATION2 excel to manage your finances! Windows movie maker allow you to contruct your own movies ifl you own a camera. Besides the obvious most helpful features, you can play computer games, watch mores and listen to music on a computer. Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are small and some can be very big. computers are expensive. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer. Also, many people have important information on a computer. Peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer rendering it imposible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence and drug use are all over the web. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over peoples lives. People spend too much time on facebook and not enough time reading or keepng in touch with family. Computers can be great things. Between their great features allowing you to be informed all the time and programs that or be great for managing buisness, it's no wonder almost every @CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I disagree. Yes, the cons can be annoying & sometimes serious. But if your smart enough to stay away from @CAPS2-@CAPS3, install anti-virus software, and never give away your information to an unamed surce, the pros outweigh the cons. So overall, if your smart enough, a computer can be a fun, convienent edition to your life allowing you to do more than you ever imagined.
340	341	1	3	Did you ever need to know something about another place, or maybe want to see your baby cousin who is not a baby anymore? Having a computer is a huge benefit to society. It not only ables you to find out information, and chat with family and friends but also can teach you hand eye coordination. A computer can tell you just about anything you need to know. This could help you learn about other cultures, places, or something as simple as what is @LOCATION1 creampie. the computer has endless knowledge. This is a huge benifit because a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button. Having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends. New computers now have webcams. This benifits you to see and speak to them without having to get on a plane or any long car rides. Which I know is a big benifit for everyone who has relatives that don't live right next door whether it helps your swing in baseball or to catch that touchdown, having a computer is a big help in hand-eye coordination. Believe it or not, having to type a paper for school helps out alot in hand-eye coordination. Having hand-eye coordination can help you out a lot in life whether in activities, school work, or jobs. It is obvious that having a computer is a huge benifit to society by having that ability to learn more, chatting with family and friends, or to help you pass the football with one of your buds. The society today wouldn't be the same without computers, as they have fundamentally improved how we connect and learn.
341	342	1	3	"Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that that benefits society. As editor of the newspaper, you have the power to inform people about situations. In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following: the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, they allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, that has @NUM1 little girls. Every day in the morning before school @PERSON1 checks on the weather, on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school. However, one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Little did he know the roads were extremely icey. Sadly @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones. As you can see, the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room. Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states says that, ""chating online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp and many other places."" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school. Also @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. I believe that chating online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades. Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time. However teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing. Finally most jobs today use computers. For example my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also the chat can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer revolutionise the jobs of people. In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society. Please take my idea into consideration."
342	343	1	3	Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 and I am a @NUM1 year old girl; yet active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. Many of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity. All of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay. I dont you want a happy and successful life?! I know I do!
343	345	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about all the intresting things you can do on computers such as call people, order groceries, and read books for school. Today it seems like the world is held together by technology and I think computers are at number one. ""@CAPS1 my older sister moved to @CAPS2 it was hard to keep intuch and see eachother, but we found out about @ORGANIZATION1, which is a site where people all over can add people and chat, call, or webcam eachother, so we do that everyday and it's like she never left home."" @PERSON2 says about the internet site @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS4 sure @PERSON2 and a lot of others love their computers. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people get more done in the day online @PERSON1 says ""everyday my day is shortened because my @CAPS3 because while at work I can order my groceries and have them delivered by four o clock @CAPS1 I arive home from work I can make doctor apt, school apts and schedul meetings all with one touch/click where ever I go, instead of looking on the calander or picking up the phone. @PERCENT1 of couples today say they met online via twitter, facebook, myspace or aol. The internet is great for meeting new people because you @CAPS4 eachother and get to know one another or look at their profile pictures and things. You cand find peolple just like you online and after a while the two of you are friends. I have some of my best friends online through a mutual friend's page and it's a sucessful friendship today. Even schools took education to the web, with all books from a class avalible at home online. Students can even check grades online now and recieve comment from teachers. So now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school. I hope I have opened your mind a little to understand the internet is not all bad, and people spend so much time on them now because everything has moved to the web like school, stores, food, even tv you name it the web has it. Personaly I spend about an hour or two on the web chating, studying, watching tv. After I might go walk or play my @CAPS5 but i'll still conected to the web because the @CAPS5 picks up on wi-fi connections. So I think computers let you open up and connect with others and get other things done on the web. I hope by now you feel the same."
344	346	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 a teanger growing up in this technologic era @MONEY1 society, I think computers are more harmful than helpful. I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. @CAPS1 a well-read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds @MONEY1 many. I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. People can lie and say they are a doctor in their @NUM1's when they are really a @NUM2 year old working at @ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find a book. Sure, the computer @MONTH1 be the quicker or ""easy way @CAPS6 "" in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because @MONEY1 the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books and it's time for that to stop. Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure @MONEY1 who you are talking to. Too many teens nowadays hide @CAPS6 in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families. What happend to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead @MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to @CAPS5 the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity @MONEY1 typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyways and you have to handwrite your @ORGANIZATION2's, so why not? Lastly computers can be dangerous and/or harmful to health. The use @MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information @CAPS6 there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many innapropriate images and websites, that youngsters, or anybody, really, should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss @MONEY1 the use @MONEY1 their fingers because @MONEY1 the movement @MONEY1 your fingers when you are typing. Getting rif @MONEY1 computers will help to impact peoples' well- being-in a positive manner. While many people enjoy the use @MONEY1 computers, there is really not that great @MONEY1 a need for them. Books are better resources, you can find fun in many other ways, and they can be dangerous/harmful to health. Why spend hundreds or @MONEY1 on a tool that is not even necessary? Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you buy one, and next time you go to turn on your computers, thinks "" @CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to @CAPS5?"" because, more than likely there will be a better way. So, sometimes it's better to say ""@CAPS6 with the new ways @MONEY1 doing things technologically in with old ways @MONEY1 doing things manually."
345	347	1	3	"Dear local @CAPS1 I hear you are not sure if computers are good or not well they are and I have many reasons why but I will tell you is. First the games teach hand eye coordination, teach people about faraway places like other countrys, last it helps to keep in touch with people. My first major reason is it can and does help hand eye coordination every day. It does this with the mouse you have to be very coordinated to be good at the games on the computer. This will help in every day lives to to play catch with your son or to pick something up it is very important. Also it can help you get on ethnic back round to learn about faraway places. If you are going on a trip I would want to know about that place to see what I need. Or to just look at how beuatiful the countrys are will make you amazed. So for just @NUM1 reasons I would already rethink. Finally I think this is most important reason of to stay in touch with I know my mom dont got a facebook and she talking to all he old friends she says ""nice"" I think have friends is very important to everyone and computers help them. I conclusion there are reasons why a computer is good like hand eye coordinations learning about faraway places. So I hope you have been I know I would have and there is no doubt is my you will make the right choice."
346	348	1	3	Dear newspaper, Many people think that computers are a waste of time and that they are dangerous. Yes, computers can be dangerous but they can also help you in many different ways. Such as paying bills online or planning a vacation and even attending college classes. For working people, bills are a struggle. They are an inconvenience and there are way too many of them. If you think about it, many people work all day and sometimes all night; wouldn't it be nice to come home and have all your bills paid? Well one way you can do that is from a computer. Computers have helpful programs that can help you pay your bills faster so that when you come home you can relax and enjoy your free time. Computers are also good for planning vacations. Many people each year use online programs to plan their vacations and trips. For example, my family and I planned a trip to Florida in the summer of last year. When we got to the airport we had first class tickets and a ride waiting when we got off the plane; that vacation was the best so far. Going into a new generation, many people are starting to take online college classes due to the fact that they work or have a kid at home. These classes are good for people with jobs because they are short and you learn a lot. A computer is very helpful for taking these classes because if you did not have one it would prevent you from taking the class. A computer is a great thing to have for all these things. So if you're a mother or a worker and you would like to go back to school you should consider taking online college classes. And if your family wants a vacation you should try out one of the many programs the internet has for traveling. It is clear that computers offer significant practical benefits for managing daily life and pursuing personal goals.
347	349	1	3	Dear, whom it may concern; Local Newspaper. I believe you are right. Computers can be helpful; they let us chat with people but we don’t exercise. We forget about family and most importantly your health. Their vision gets bad, they eat more junk food and that can lead to bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even diabetes. A computer is very addicting; people stay up on it for hours. It will give you bad hygiene, so I think you should really take a look at this and put this in the Newspaper and alert all residents. I know it could be very fun and enjoyable but it would be all fun and games until you are very sick. You might take this as a joke but this is highly serious in many ways. Not being with the people you love and not doing any activities is a problem; you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life. A computer is like a drug, but do it for your family and listen to my point of view. I think all computers should be banned for at least one week, except to look up on work or school and maybe even your health. This might seem like we are overreacting on this but we really aren't. Do you want the population of people having diabetes and other causing effects that can happen to your body to increase? Well I think not; how would that make you feel? Not good at all, so people get on your feet and jog. Do whatever you can to enjoy time with your family. So just listen to me and stop this bad habit before it leads to more serious health consequences.
348	350	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Can you imagine a world without computers? Well I can't because I think computers are great. First of all, if you have a computer you can meet new people. Second, you can do projects on them or homework if you need to. Lastly, on a computer you can basically find out anything you want to know. Read ahead and discover why I think computers are great. Who doesn't like meeting new people, because I do. If you wanted to get new friends or find anyone who goes to your school and you might not know, you can look them up on your computer. Also, if you had nobody to talk to one time you can go on the computer and try to meet new people. I know I do that all the time. Lastly, it doesn't hurt anymore to make friends or talk to people online; it's actually fun once you try it. So that's why I think one reason that computers are great is because of the people you meet. The second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project, a computer can help. My science teacher always wants assignments printed and how could I do that without a computer? Also, if one day you forgot your homework or any assignments, just ask a friend online or if you have a school website look on it. Therefore, computers are great because all assignments look better when they are printed. My last reason is because on a computer you can pretty much look for anything. For example, say you wanted to find a place to go to and you didn't have an address or anything, you can always check on the computer. Also, if there is a problem or something with your house, car, bills, or anything you can always see if you can get any help on the internet. Lastly, if you wanted to buy anything and you couldn't find it in any store you can just get it online. So basically, like I said, you can do anything. In conclusion, I think computers have a great effect on life. First, you can meet new people or friends. Second, you can do projects or homework. Lastly, you can basically do anything on a computer. So that's why I think computers are great and they can help a lot in life instead of hurting anyone.
349	351	1	3	Dear newspaper, Some people say that computers don't benefit society. But I think different. Computers benefit society more than you would think. They help people learn and make work much easier. They help prevent accidents, and they save lives. Computers help people learn and make work easier; it's a fact. You can type, you can plan your schedule. You can make a presentation or check your email. All of those things make work easier, and there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before, they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Making work easier or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computer's abilities. Computers can prevent accidents in anything that moves. For example, cars; millions on the road today and some can practically drive themselves, and that is all done with computers. Also planes; the only reason the pilot is there is in case something goes wrong. Same thing with trains. Furthermore, many systems are completely computerized; all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time, and that makes the world safer for everyone. Finally, computers save lives; it's completely true. In hospitals without computers, people would be dying every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs, and assist with surgery. In surgery, computers help by only having to make a tiny incision and can be much more accurate than human surgeons, which saves lives. Also, computers can make sure that an operating room is completely sterile, which reduces risks of infection. As you can see, computers benefit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easier. They prevent accidents, which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go, they are almost guaranteed a survival. So what do you think about them now?
350	352	1	3	Dear Editor, Experts agree that people should go outside and exercise because there are three reasons why people should go outside: people don't get a lot of exercise, they can hang out with their friends and family, and people and kids should enjoy the outside nature. Let me explain; people and kids these days do not have a lot of exercise. People who don't exercise can gain weight if they don't exercise at all. Also, parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be overweight. Kids these days have a hard time exercising because they are overweight from staying on their computer and playing their computer games. Wouldn't you agree that kids and adults can hang out with their friends and family? Kids need to stop going on the computer and go outside more often with their friends or family. You might want to consider that parents need to spend time with their friends and family instead of staying on the computer at home. Don't you think that people should go outside and enjoy the nature? Amazingly, people know what nature is but they don't know what the true meaning of nature is! Adults should spend time by going outside then staying at their house because a significant percentage of the world doesn't have a computer at all. Embracing the outdoors is essential for physical health and strengthening family bonds.
351	353	1	3	To many people, technology is a good and essential thing to have. If we did not have technology then we could not call anyone. We would not have computers to go online, and we could not easily talk to our family or friends who live far away. People use technology for their jobs; for instance, mechanics who work on cars need computers to diagnose problems or check a vehicle's history. That is why we will continue to need technology. People need technology for a lot of things and have technology to use. Computers are a big part of this because we need to look up a lot of information online, and we also need computers to take tests for school or work. We call people with technology, and you use computers to go online on websites like google.com. That is why we need technology, so we can call people and access the vast resources available to us.
352	354	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, Over the years computers have been a great invention. They have helped people learn more information, communicate with others, and invent more technology. This is a positive effect for our country, so let me explain. Computers are a positive effect for our country because they help us find information for school projects and for locations when we need directions. The computer helps me find information for my science project much faster than going to the library and looking up information in a book,"" said one student in fifth grade. In case we get lost on the roads, the computer can help us get to our destination using maps. Another reason why computers are a positive effect on our country is because they can help us communicate with our friends and family. ""When I can't contact my mom, I email her on my computer,"" said another person. Also, many parents can contact their child's teacher and email them to see how they are doing in class. The last reason why computers are a positive effect on our country is because they can help us invent different things. Scientists can easily invent more kinds of technology by using computers to design and model their ideas. ""The computer has helped us first make a model of our invention before we start making the details,"" explained a researcher. Over the years computers have helped us with almost everything. In conclusion, the computer helps us with our search for information, helps us contact people, and helps us make new inventions. This has also helped us in wars by improving communication and strategy. We should let the computers be in the schools and workplaces to continue this progress."
353	355	1	3	Dear Editor, I think that computers are a waste of time, but they also help you in many ways. You should only go on the computer if you really have to. Many people are on the computer for hours at a time; they go on the computer if they are bored or if they do not want to go outside. People have made the computer faster and more effective, so more and more people buy computers each year. Computers also help you in a lot of ways; you can learn from a computer, you can find a job on the computer, and you can also shop on the computer. So if you need to find a job, then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you and your skills. You can learn from the computer, as it can give you so much information it is unbelievable; you can look up anything and even ask questions online. Last, you can shop on the computer. Say you cannot find something in a store and you looked everywhere, so you go home and you can go on the computer and find what you are looking for in an online store. But, you most likely are going to need a credit card to complete the purchase. So this is why I think computers are helpful for these tasks but can also be a significant waste of time if not used purposefully.
354	356	1	3	"Dear Newspaper Editor, I am on the computer a lot, but I think it is one of the most addicting and time-consuming inventions in today's society. Yes, computers have benefits such as talking to friends and family you do not see that often, doing school work, and gathering information quickly. But in my opinion, people should reduce their usage of computers. Sure, computers let you interact with friends and family via e-mail, or instant messaging, or social networking websites such as Facebook or Twitter. Guess what? You can easily communicate the old fashioned way with cell phones, or even by writing a letter. See? There are alternatives for communication. Exercise is so important nowadays, and people do not get enough of it. Did you know that obesity has gone up significantly since last year? That is a fairly big percentage, and we do not want it to get any bigger. If people are wasting away, staring at their computer screen and not getting any sort of exercise in, the number will get bigger. Also, computers can cause all kinds of medical problems. For example, about a month ago my back was really bothering me. I went to the doctors and he told me one of the likely causes was leaning forward to go on my laptop. ""Computers can also cause vision problems and headaches,"" says a specialist. We can prevent these issues if we take a stand against computers! We can limit our use to two or three times a week, and only use it for important reasons. I hope this really is an eye-opener to the negative effects computers have on our health and daily lives."
355	357	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways. Some effects can be terrible, and others are not so bad. Many average people are now staying inside all day on the computer playing games, or on Facebook and other interactive websites such as Twitter and Instagram. This crisis is interfering with school, work, and exercise. More and more people each day are not getting enough exercise or work done. We have to stop this devastating pandemic! People who are staying inside all day are not as healthy as they were before. Their immune system weakens, making the risk of getting sick greater. This can cause severe health problems for people or even lead to death. If you stay inside all day every day, the computer will be so addicting it will take over you and make it seem more important than your health. In order to maintain health, you have to eat right and get good exercise like riding a bike. When someone is inside on the computer frequently, they are not engaging in physical activity. If you are addicted to something like watching T.V. or playing video games, or if you are addicted to the computer, it can also interfere with family events and sports. When you are on the computer, you forget about homework, and your grades drop drastically, making you go to summer school or even repeat a grade. Also, if you do not prepare for sports, it can make you not play up to your potential. This is why computers are affecting everyday people. There are more reasons how people are being affected by computers, but these are the most common and concerning issues we face today.
356	358	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personally disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The reason why I disagree is because it is not the computer's fault that people don't get out and exercise. Buying a computer and getting on the computer is an act of free will; the computer doesn't force you to use it. That is our own choice, so we cannot blame the computer for people not exercising. Another important thing to remember is that computers are important because they help you get more educated. For example, there are computer classes online for people that want to get their degree in different fields. With just a click of a button, it can change your future and career for the rest of your life. The most important reason is because it helps people learn about different cultures and ways of life. I love learning about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2 even though they had that terrible storm. I thank you for listening to my opinion and I hope that it changes your point of view about living a life without computers, as they offer significant benefits when used responsibly.
357	359	1	3	Being active has no limit, but technology does have its constraints. Human potential for physical movement and engagement with the world is boundless, whereas any piece of technology is ultimately defined by its programming and physical components. This fundamental difference reminds us that while we can always push our bodies further, a machine will eventually reach the end of its capabilities. Therefore, we must remember that our physical selves are not bound by the same finite rules that govern our digital creations.
358	360	1	3	Do Computers @CAPS1 Society? This question might be debated forever. I have an opinion about this and it might not affect everyone in the world but I do hope so. Exercising is a great way to stay in shape, but if you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 all day you don't have a chance to stay in shape. So while everyone is fit, you eventually will be fat. While you sit there playing the same @ORGANIZATION1 game, everyone is outside playing at the park, swimming in the pool, or fishing at the lake. Sitting on a @ORGANIZATION1 destroys your life both physically and socially. Lastly, the @ORGANIZATION1 will stop you from spending quality time with friends and family. Also, this will stop you from interacting with new friends, and your old ones will find new ones. If you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 hours a day, you will miss out on the awesome @CAPS2 life you were waiting for since you can remember. So the next time your friend says to go online after school, say you'd rather not because you don't want to get addicted and miss the real world happening around you.
359	361	1	3	Computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers help people in many ways. They teach people about history and faraway places. They also are a great way to express yourself. Computers are another way to communicate to people far away or just a few houses down. Computers have a vast amount of knowledge and more is added everyday. Everyday I go on the computer I learn something new. You can search the word @LOCATION1 and instantly have millions of web pages in front of you that all hold new knowledge and exciting things about @LOCATION1. Computers are much faster than having to go down to the local library and look for a book that has the information you need. You can also find different views and perspectives of a subject online. Depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events, which you cannot always find in books at the library. Computers have a wealth of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things. Computers can also entertain you. There are many entertaining websites online that you can go to when you are bored. There are books and magazines you can read at anytime you want. If you like to read then check online, there @MONTH1 be a book you enjoy free of charge to read. Some people like to play games. On the computer you can find almost any game you want to play. These are board games, video games, strategy games, adventure games, and many many more than that. I could go on for hours listing all the different types. If you like sports you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports. You could find ways to improve how you play or learn to play that sport. If you like to watch @CAPS1, you can also do that on a computer. Some @CAPS2 programs put the different episodes online so people can easily view them just by one click of the mouse. Computers can benefit anybody who uses them. Computers help teach you things and entertain you, but they also can help you communicate with your friends and family. Many programs let you connect to people through the internet. You could send emails to your cousin half way across the world. In emails you can attach pictures and files with text to communicate. There are various programs for instant messaging, which means that you can instantly send a message to another person using that program. You type a message in and away it goes, instantly reaching the person you are trying to reach. Now there are even more ways to communicate; you can make audio calls to a person using the computer. It is like a phone, just on the computer. Web cams make it possible to record and send video instantly, but can also be used to talk to someone through a video call. The program connects you to your friends or family and you can see them through a video. Computers are a great way to communicate with others. Computers help in a positive way. They give you access to an amazing amount of information. They can entertain you. Computers are also a great way to communicate to people no matter how far away that person is. I would completely say that computers are a positive thing for society.
360	362	1	3	"Newspaper, I feel that the use of computers is no big deal. It is a convenient way to communicate, it teaches young adults and adults social and life skills, and is no different than other minor addictions. These three reasons are why I feel the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated. My first reason why I feel that the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated is that some people think that less time is spent with family, but I talk to family and friends every time on the @ORGANIZATION1. It is a convenient, fast, and for the most part safe way of communicating. When I need help with something, I sit at the @ORGANIZATION1 and fb chat someone, or if they're not on, I e-mail them. I get my answer within a day. Also you can look up the answer online; the internet is a beautifully smart device. Also if you call someone versus chatting on the @ORGANIZATION1 you @MONTH1 have no idea who they are; it is also much easier to trace a call then trace a @ORGANIZATION1 to a certain location. Communication is faster, safer, and more convenient over the @ORGANIZATION1. My second reason for being @NUM1 is that it can help teach social and life skills. For example, did you know that on average, an adult will make @MONEY1 more if they know how to type well and fast? The @ORGANIZATION1 serves many functions. Facebook, for example, is a social network; many young adults can learn basic social skills by having a facebook. Social skills play a very important role when you are finding a job for the first time. If you have good social skills, your boss @MONTH1 like and appreciate you more, which can only lead to a promotion. Computers are very nifty to have around. My third, and final reason, for believing, with all respect, that @NUM2 people are blinded, is that people don't easily get addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. It is very hard to become addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. Only about @PERCENT3 of facebook users are addicted. Compared to an alcohol addiction, about @PERCENT1, or drug addiction, @PERCENT2, @ORGANIZATION1 addiction is microscopic, and not to mention, not deadly. The only similarity between the @ORGANIZATION1 and other deadlier addictions is that they are addicted and @MONTH1 become grumpy if asked to stop. ""@ORGANIZATION1 addiction can be cured with a speedy recovery, and as long as you are on for an hour or less a day, there is nothing to worry about,"" says @PERSON1 at the @NUM3. @CAPS1, there you have it; computer use is not a major problem. It is a convenient communication device, an effective way to learn social and life skills, and is no huge major source of addiction. @CAPS1, there is nothing to worry about. Sit back and look it up on the internet if you don't believe me; the facts speak for themselves."
361	363	1	3	I agree that computers do benefit society because everyone uses one or has one; it helps you with important stuff as the computer makes things easy. For instance, you can quickly find information for a project or manage your schedule with digital calendars. Computers even give exercise in a way, as typing and using the mouse makes your fingers move faster and can improve dexterity. The computer is the best thing ever that happened to this world; you can chat with your friends and family, print writing, and play games. What can get better than that? We can research a famous person, Google historical figures, and look up pictures from around the globe. But the computer also makes you lazy because it makes you wanna just sit there and never get off of it; its addicting to people, but others just don't know the meaning of using or having a computer. If those others had a computer, they would change their mind once they experienced its uses. You can go on Myspace, thanks to Tom, to talk to friends, family, and people from a different town or state. You also can go on Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Twitter; the computer and internet are really fun and give you a little mental and physical activity. And it helps you with your school work, homework, and research about a country, place, house, or vacation; you can do lots of things. But then the other people have a point: enjoying nature is good because it gets you healthy and strong, and it will get you playing sports more and having fun outside instead of staying inside all day doing nothing, staring at your computer screen not wanting to get sleep or go outside. So both are pretty much the same to me, but I do side with the first opinion because computers are the best for the vast opportunities they provide in our modern world.
362	364	1	3	You've got mail! That cheerful sound greets me from my computer, which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with this technology. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in these incredible machines; with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like never before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do remarkable things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typewriters and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand-eye coordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreme amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday lists, computers have made this a faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for work or school are written using a computer. Secondly, we have gained amazing hand-eye coordination skills. Furthermore, by typing and reading at the same time, we have trained our eyes to do many complex things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check and grammar tools, we are able to edit papers without using someone else's help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective. Without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is a primary one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many wonderful communication applications such as email clients, instant messengers, social media platforms, and video chat services, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them; however, due to these platforms, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas, and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extremely efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures faster, easier, and with hundreds more opinions, within seconds; thanks to popular search engines and other resources, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly simple: type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there are many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened countless doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate as effectively, and find information in such a streamlined fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are experiencing the efficiency of using computers, and now we can too! It is evident that computers are effective and are advancing technology in our society for the better.
363	365	1	3	"Can you imagine a world full of lifeless zombies obsessing over technology such as computers, television, and cellular phones? Our world as we know it will come to an abrupt end if we don't stop this nonsense. Computers can cause obesity, a lack of interaction, and they make people waste their time on these useless items. Our world can't set aside time for such distractions. Our planet is run by us humans, and if we don't take care of its necessities, we will all die including our beloved planet Earth. Computers aren't a benefit to our society today. First off, computers can cause major obesity like it has done already. Obesity is one of the most brought up health problems in the world. Many issues cause obesity but technology, especially computers, take a big role in it. Instead of sitting on a computer all day, people can do something a lot more productive such as taking a walk, starting a club for adults or children, or helping out neighbors, etc. So what if they teach hand-eye coordination; they don't teach us how to stay fit! Computers play a big role in the obesity factor. As adults, you should know how much obesity matters. Children are the future; nobody would want the future leaders to be known for widespread obesity. Nevertheless, computers take away ""bonding"" time from family and friends. Adults and children alike are lacking social needs. They don't verbally and physically interact with their ""online friends."" And they wonder why families these days are turning out the way they are; the source of the cause is computers. Anyways, people spend too much time on computers; if people didn't waste so much time on computers they wouldn't be losing jobs like dropping flies. The unemployment rate is high because they suppose they ""don't have enough time,"" when all their time is devoted to computers. If they took out the computers in their lives, they would have plenty of time to do such important tasks. No one wants a ""stay at home"" unemployed loser as themselves. In the end, computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society. They cause obesity, corrupt social needs, and eat the people's time away. You might think computers allow others to ""chat"" online with their ""online friends,"" but they don't provide our physical and verbal social needs which results in a low self-esteem. If newspapers keep publishing articles about the ""benefits of computers,"" people will soon stop believing that nonsense and eventually stop purchasing these newspapers. Nobody wants to read lies, do they? It is clear that we must reassess our dependence on this technology."
364	366	1	3	Computers, Computers, Computers, it's all we hear about today. New websites, chatrooms, games and much more dominate the conversation. I agree with the experts who think that we should spend more time outdoors with friends and family. Computers take over peoples lives; you don't know who is looking you up on Facebook or other social media sites, and now you can do almost anything on them. Lunch breaks, work tasks, social planning, and entertainment are all consumed by them. Computers are taking over our lives. Believe it or not, some people bring computers everywhere they go, and once you get on that device, chances are you won't be getting off it for a while because you keep clicking and keep finding new stuff. I do have to say computers are a cool device, but there has to be a limit. We can not be on the internet for hours looking up trivial gossip or endless streams of content. You got to come back to earth and spend time with your family. The computer might be a cool device, but that does not mean that it is safe to post stuff about you on it. Facebook and similar platforms are probably two of the most dangerous sites to be on. Anybody could just type in a name and get numerous matches and find you even though you don't know them. People are not always as they say they are. People could say that they are a young adult just leaving college when it's really an older individual with different intentions. Don't trust anybody online. Now and days you don't even have to leave your house. You can shop, talk, file taxes, pay bills, and have a virtual life on the computer. Pretty soon the human kind as we know it will become altogether absorbed through the screen. Some computers probably have a smarter system than some humans do. What I am saying is limit your time on the computer, or that's where you will be spending it all. Now you know that I think that computers need to be seen less throughout the human day. Also, that they are taking over our lives, are dangerous, and you don't even have to leave your house to make a living. I hope you take my thoughts into consideration and find a healthier balance with technology.
365	367	1	3	There are a lot of positive things about technology, especially computers. Computers give you a chance to communicate with people from all around the world; also, computers give you the opportunity to go on educating websites, and last, they make it easier to shop and pay bills. Talking to people from around the world can be interesting and enlightening. Computers help you do that using the internet. You can learn about different people and their cultural background, or even talk to your friends and families that live in other cities, states, or maybe even countries. Yes, some people might say they cost too much, but that's really only a one-time price for long-term benefits. Computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers. That reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites and access vast digital libraries. On the other hand, it is helpful for teachers because they can put their students' grades online and won't have kids bugging them about what their average is in a certain class. Yes, I know there are bad inappropriate websites, but there are a lot of ways to block them with parental controls and security software. For an example, I had a difficult subject in school and I needed a lot of help, and my teacher told me about a website called Study Island, and by going on that every day, it boosted my grade up significantly. Computers give you a chance to get your bills paid and do some shopping for a cheaper price. There are ways that your things that you buy online could come a few days late; but think about how much time and money you're saving because you ordered offline instead of going to the store. But it's also very helpful to people with disability, offering them access to the world from their home. There are a lot of positive things about computers. They give you a chance to communicate with people across the world, and they give you a chance to go on educating websites, and last, they help you pay bills and go shopping. Local Newspaper, computers are a big benefit to society, and without them, a lot of things wouldn't be possible in our interconnected modern age.
366	368	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Computers have helped us in many ways. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs and computers have helped law enforcement as well. Yes, i, agree some people do spend too much time on these machines, but that doesn't mean they haven't helped us. Computers help children and adults learn so much. Children can use their computer to re-search homework they're doing or even just research thing for fun, accessing a vast digital library of information. Most adults have been through school and are educated but computers help them make discoveries about space, the human body, etc. So not only are computers teaching children, but they're part of making new discoveries that need to be taught to children. Right now our economy is not doing to well. A ton of people are out of jobs and can't support their families. But imagine how many more people would be out of work if we didn't have computers. @PERCENT1 of our society works with computers. An that means @PERCENT1 of the people won't have jobs. Computers not only give us knowledge but they give over half us catch the members of society that do wrong. Computers have helped catch law enforcement for a little bit more than @NUM1 years. Yes, crime has gone up in the past years, but computers have helped us catch criminals. Computers store massive amounts of data, which means we can story already arrested criminal's finger prints, pictures, @CAPS2, previous record, etc. to help us catch criminals, making investigations faster and more efficient. So yes computers have helped us in more ways than one. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs, and helped law enforcement. Even if people spend too much time on thse machines, it's their decision and look how much computers have helped us. Make the right decision let out technology continue to edvance.
367	369	1	3	"Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, @CAPS2 computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real-life. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be playing a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me "" @CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?"" and i answer ""@CAPS2 i have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3."" @CAPS4, the computer takes time away from nature. People dont acknowledge the beauty of the outdoor world. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more than @CAPS2 it helps us to appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet computer take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real-life. Some people dont know how to have a face-to-face conversation, they only know how to communicate by email or @CAPS5. I acknoowledge that getting away from real life can be relaxing but some people dont know which side the stomp goes on a letter. It @MONTH1 old-fashioned, but i believe people put their heart into a handwritten letter, something you can't do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real-life, nature and your hobbies. Plus, you can get arthritis in your hands if you type to much."
368	370	1	3	"Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Anything at all that you @MONTH1 need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion. Wouldn't you agree with me?"
369	371	1	3	About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and friends, exercise your brain and there is time to enjoy nature later.
370	372	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I think computers have a good effect on people. Computers are very helpful to many it gives them an education, and they can interact with many people. Computers can be very helpful to many people. Working with computers can give people extremly well hand-eye coordination. Dr. @PERSON4 said, ""In recent surveys and tests, I have noticed a major increase with hand-eye coordination of @PERCENT1 all thanks to computers. ""Computers is also a way that people can learn to type in a recent survey at @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1-more students know to type, thanks to computers. Computers can be very helpful to business people with creating power points. Instead of making a really big poster board for @CAPS2 @CAPS1 project, I made a power point instead that was so much easier. Computers can be very helpful to many people. Computers are used in many schools to help teach students about new things. For example, students can learn about interesting places that they never knew about. ""@CAPS2 friends is moving to @LOCATION1 and she has no idea what it's like, or where it is. So, we looked it up on the internet and found out so much cool stuff about it, "" says @PERSON5 computers can also teach students about new cultures. At @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT2 of the students learned about @NUM2 new cultures in one year, thanks to computers. Not only can computers tell people about interesting places, but interesting people. I never knew that president @PERSON2 had @NUM3 brothers, and gre up in @LOCATION2, did you? Computers can be used in schools to help teach students about new things. Computers are used by many people to interact with another. using computers is an easy way to talk with friends. Using instant messenger is free! Now parents don't have to pay annoying phone bills anymore! In a recent survey done in the town of @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 of the people there thought that using computers to talk to friends was alot easier. Computers can help people meet new people online. Habe you ever heard of the dating sites? Well, this is what @PERSON1 has to say about it, ""@CAPS6 wonderful! @CAPS2 husband and I met online and we have been together for @NUM4 years."" @CAPS7 you have a faw away cousin and if you call or write them a letter it's too expensive? Well now you don's have to worry about that anymore because talking to distant relatives online is free! ""@CAPS6 so much easier talking to people online."" says @PERSON3. Computers can be used to interact with another. Computers have a very good effect on people. They are helpful, can be used to give education, and they can be used to interact with another."
371	373	1	3	"To whom it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, I have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern day computers have on society. Some people feel they have a positive effect, such as learning new information, and interacting or chatting with other people. Others feel that society is devoting to much time to computers, they feel that these people are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and with their family. I feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer. People think that all things on the internet are true, they're not, @PERCENT1 of all teens across the country are addicted to the computer. First, things posted on the internet are not always true. They can be posted by anyone, whether it's true or not. My friend found a website with very detailed information for an essay. She turned it in, and the teacher gave it back the following day. In big red letters it said ""false information"" @CAPS2 she had gotten the information from a book. she pobably would've gotten an ""A+"". This shows how easily false facts can be spread online and trusted. Second, @PERCENT1 of teens living in the @LOCATION1 have become addicted to using the computer. My friend was obsessed with facebook from @NUM1 until @NUM2 she was on, daily. She began failing classes. She didn't do homework, didn't study for tests! She failed the @NUM3 grade. This all happened because she was addicted to a website. Her story is a clear example of how computer addiction can harm a student's academic life and future. This is why I agree with the statement that experts are concerned with people spending to much time on the computer @CAPS2 you want to continue a healthy lifestyle, and avoid becoming to addicted to the computer, limit yourself. Make the smart choice and set boundaries for your screen time to protect your well-being and your relationships with those around you."
372	374	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that people who uses alot of technology such as computer are not good, technology can affect adults and even more is children. Children who go on chatting websites such as facebook are starting to see a difference which is in there grades. I found out children who gois on face book are starting to not turn in home work and there grades are going completly down, I heard a student say once he had got on face book he stoped doing his homework and reading his grade dropeed from a @CAPS1 t a @CAPS2 average because he was much focused on the computer than school and his reading. I belive computers can be really addicted to people the first time you get on a website it go's from once a day to twice a day and further on its as if the computer is sometime connected to you and we can let go. People who allow themself to chat online can also be a dangerous thing, young females and males think its exciting to chat with some one in a different state or city but its not exciting its very dangerous. Chating online is very dangerous because the person that you are talking to could have murdered people or could have kidnapped kids or could be wanied but we wouldn't know because on chat lines you dont have to put your fear name, you could put a false picture, and unknown age that's why in cases something go missing because they didd'ent think before they started chating. Another reason why using or being on a computer can be bad because it can lead to a strong distraction from you family instead of sitting down and asking your family now was thier day you'll be in a rush to go on the computer. The computer can also lower you test and quiz grades you can be on the computer for a maximum of hours that you need to be studying for a huge exam the next day and when you fail theres no one to blame but yourself because of your addiction to the usage of an computer. In conclusion @PERCENT1 of people have been affected by computers and its not a good thing you could miss a day out of work or you can be tired and exhaused because all your energy is wasted stay off of computers unless educational for the sake of your safety, your family, and your future success.
373	375	1	3	I not agreed the people shuld d in the computer a lot and I going to said way. My first reason is because if you are a @NUM1 old man or your not going to d wit your kids and you going to have eyes problem so thas way you shuld in d in the computer a lot. Staring at the screen for too long can cause headaches and strain your eyes, making it hard to see properly. My secon reason is the you going to have problem wit your wife if she found out the you are talking to another woman online because a lot of people they wife found out the they cant d wit other woman. This can break trust and lead to serious arguments in the home. My teard reason is the if you are a kid like me you not going to have fun and you not going to have friends because the computer problem came and go and not going to d wit your family and you lil sister out said playing wit her. You will miss out on playing outside and making real memories with your family and friends. So thas why you shulding d a lot in the computer and instead spend more time with the people who care about you in real life.
374	376	1	3	@ORGANIZATION2. Hey ma name is @PERSON1 I'm @NUM1 years old I go to @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 going to talk to you about expert people saying that computers are effecting the society. But technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. More and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. People think computer benefits society, @CAPS3 it don't people learn more they also could talk to people online if they dont got a cell phone to talk you could also research places you wana go to vacation and you could see how it look. Computer is one of the best things they inveted, but is bad to some people because they want to search direction and vecation places but they cant so is hard for people who dosen't got a computer to find out, computer dosen't benefit the society. Those who support advances in technology belive that computer have a positive effect on people. A computer is one important in ma life if @CAPS2 behind in some classes I could do some research and study at home and learn about it. I lost ma cell phone but now I talk to ma friends online when ma parents dosent wana take me shopping I go shopping online is easyer to look fourwut you want. People learn alot with computers, computer is @CAPS3 the world. You could see earth, space the city and wuts going on in internet computer dosent effect the society dosent effect the society in makes it easyer. Give people ability to learn about far away places and people and even allow people to talk online people. I dont know about @LOCATION1 the only thing I knew it was hot but I searched abot it @LOCATION1 is like a cool/park is alot of fun things you could do so I want for vacation and things was true. Online is a great place to chat with friends or family you could keep in touch. Some expert people concern that people are to mouch time in computer instead of exercising. @CAPS1 people do spend alot of time in computer but they do exercite when they go out with family the play the sport when they shopping the are walking thats exercising i bee in the computer @NUM2 but I still exercite I play basketball all the time from the morning till the afternoon because ma health is in portant. You see exspert people you might thing computer are effecting us but is not is the world real easy to find direction places to have a wonder full vecation and it help us study for @ORGANIZATION1 we could apply for jobs and @ORGANIZATION1 online computers are helping us learn and connect in ways that were not possible before.
375	377	1	3	Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine life without your computer? No? Well that's what I am trying to change. Millions of @CAPS2 spend countless hours with their eyes glued to '@ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3 monitor screens. Spending that much time sitting in one space isn't healthy, not only do people not get enough exercise but they don't get the chance to apperiate the natural world around them that is ever changing. Teens and even small children get lost in cyberworld and don't use their after school time wisely to study or do homework. The internet is also a dangerous place and the growing computer use with maximize the problem. To begin, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is growing rapidly, a recent study done by the @LOCATION2. goverment shows that @NUM1 people are over weight and @NUM2 people are on the of obesity. We @CAPS4 could decrease the obesity rate and be healthier and happier by exersicing and getting out more. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight. Secondly, the more time you spend cooped up inside the less time you get to enjoy nature. The natural world is ever changing, and you will miss out on a lot of amazing opportunities if you hardly ever step foot outside your front door. Execive comouter use will wear them out quicker than normal, where does your old word out computer go when you get the @ORGANIZATION2? A landfill! The more your use your computer the faster you will trash it. If every @CAPS5 threwout one computer a year their would be over @NUM3 million discarded dells, gateways, macs, we would be living in trash. @CAPS1 exesive computer use ruins the environment, and hurts your health! What are you waiting for? Go run outside! Ride a bike! Give your computer a break. Finally, the growing computer use increases the amount of internet predetors, and the odds that you or your child could be tougeled skyrocket. With more and more kids on the computer each okey the, internet saftey level drops. Not only could these children be watching inappopriate videos on youtube or cyber bulling on @CAPS6, they could be giving personal information out to people they don't even know without realizing it on myspace and facebook, @PERCENT1 of kiddnappings are possible because of information found on the computer. Do you want any thing like that ever to happen to you or your family? I didn't think so. Get up off of your comfy computer chairs and take a walk. Limit your internet and computer use, all it does is hurt you, theres no gain. Thank you for reading and don't support rapid advances in computer technology for the good of your health and safety.
376	378	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have been beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money and take more time. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to answer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone for immediate and reliable information. Clearly, the ability to contact others and access vital news is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you do not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is at their office and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work efficiently? The need for a desktop, tablet, or laptop is obviously great when you work, as they are fundamental tools for modern business. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the television and wait through all of those tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a CD and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing cards and set a game up. All I need is my computer for instant entertainment. Without a doubt the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out and provide relaxation. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts lead to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society.
377	379	1	3	I believe that computers have a great effect on people. People all around the world use computers to talk online with other people, give people ability to learn about faraway people and places, and also let you explore the internet; computers are a great influence on our lifestyle. Computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family. Some websites that allow you to do so are myspace, facebook, and Skype. With facebook you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page and share updates with everyone you know. It is really quite easy. Also, with Skype you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing through a video call. But if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam. I have Skype and I think that it is a wonderful resource. I have relatives in another state that I only get to see once a year. But with the help of my computer I can interact with them all year round, making the distance feel much smaller. Computers can make people from faraway places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle. Have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer? Well, in this commercial the boy is laying down on his bed and is eating an Oreo cookie. While he is doing this he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. At the same time both father and son dip their cookie into a glass of milk, eat it and laugh. I felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are both in opposite directions the two are still having a great time together. Just to think that it was all because of one computer connecting them. Exploring the internet is what a computer can do. When doing this you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored. You can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games, such as how many points a famous player got for your fantasy team. Also, at my school you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz. For example if I had all A's but one B in math, then I would know that I would need to really study for my next test to get an A on it. With the help of the internet, I can do all of this from home. So, now you know why computers are a very important part of our society. Computers allow us to talk online with other people, give people the opportunity to learn about faraway people and places, and computers also allow everyone to explore the internet for both fun and important information. As you can see now, computers are a great influence to our lifestyle.
378	380	1	3	"*Click* that was the sound of a light bulb going off in your head. You learned something new! Yipee, if it wasn't for the internet on computers, you would have to read those boring textbooks. Computers have a good effect on people because they teach so much valuable information, they can answer your question in a few seconds, and also they give you communication to the entire world! Imagine this, you need to know who the third president of the United States was. Are you going to go to the computer and save a bunch of time? or are you going to walk over to those miserable books? Guess what... the capital of a foreign country is its major city, the constitution of the nation says that a person has the right to speak freely, and a famous leader, one of history's greatest, was assassinated in his car. If it wasn't for the internet, I wouldn't have known that so quickly. A large number of websites on the internet are for educational value. A technology major at a university recently said, ""The internet is a huge chunk in education, and if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't know the things we do today. Its packed with so much to learn, its very useful, and forces so much info into them."" Another expert, Lila, a technology major said, ""A high percentage of people communicate through computers, another portion through phones, and a small amount through mail."" A significant number of people over the age of nine have an email. Incredible numbers of emails are sent everyday. What would it be like without computers? Think about those numbers you just read, isn't that incredible how connected we are? Computers have a good effect on people because they teach so much valuable information, they can answer your question in seconds, and also they give you communication to the entire world. If you just take a step back, you notice how valuable something really is to you and how much it has changed our lives for the better."
379	381	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, more and more people are getting hooked on computers. I am here to say that computers are not the best way to benefit our society. First off, most individuals are spending less time with friends and family and more time looking through a screen. Also, it would be so much better for our bodies and minds to go out and enjoy nature instead. Lastly, you can get addicted to the computer. So here are my reasons why computers do not benefit our society. My first reason includes friends and family. More and more people are neglecting to spend time with their loved ones to get to the next level on 'Star Wars' or other games. Is this really how we want our future generations growing up, looking blankly at computer screens? I know I don't want that. I know this from personal experience. When I was young, I visited my cousin often. All I would get to see of him was a quick 'hello', but then he'd escape to his room to continue clicking angrily on the computer. The point is you can't replace family and friends with a computer screen. It's not right and it harms our real-life relationships. My next argument against computers is about our bodies and minds. The best way to take care of those things is through nature. Unfortunately most people aren't getting outside for a bit of exercise due to computers. In fact almost half of all individuals say they spend more time on the computer than anywhere else. This is not a good way to spend time. We need to solve this issue before more people make the switch from nature to computers. Fresh air, trees and birds are much better than a screen, a couple clicks, and the hum of a machine for your health and happiness. My third and final reason is about addiction. So many people are getting addicted to the things they are finding on their computers. Addiction is a very serious matter that we need to fix. All of this is pointing to laziness too from lack of interest in anything else. I know this from personal experience. When my brother first got his computer he literally locked himself in his room for days. All he did for almost a week was socialize online and beat his personal best score on a game. This is not the way to be treating a device; it should be a tool, not a trap. So, as I know you can all see computers don't have a positive impact on our society. First of all computers are over ruling family and friends. Also, nature is becoming less and less of a priority with the computer in mind. Lastly it's becoming a worldwide addiction that is hard to break. Thank you for deeply considering all the arguments that I have to offer. I know it majorly helps people keep in touch globally, but there are other ways to do it, such as mail or meeting in person, which are often more meaningful.
380	382	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, computers benefit society immensely. They help us learn about far away places, they help us with our school work and they let us communicate with other people online. We need computers. Computers allow us to learn about other countries, people, cultures etc... How would we learn about places we might want to go on vacation? Or how would we learn about the places we want to see, and the places we want to stay away from? We need computers to do this quickly and efficiently. We would never even know of some countries if it weren't for computers bringing the world to our fingertips. Next computers help us with our school work. Sometimes we get projects and most of them involve research! Computers make this a whole lot easier on us by providing instant access to a vast library of information. Also instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back, we can use online textbooks which are lighter and always available. Why give us extra work, it's a waste of everyone's time. Instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone, you can chat online for free. Wasting minutes is wasting money. Who wants to do that? Besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you with your typing skills in the future. A majority of students say they prefer to talk online then to call someone. Computers benefit us by easy access to info for homework and studies. Computers are a lot easier to help us with school work, than heavy textbooks are. Lastly computers let us talk to other people online, keeping us connected with friends and family across the street or across the globe. Without computers everything would be so much harder and take much more time, slowing down our progress and our connections.
381	383	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers are good for providing us with useful information? I certainly @CAPS2. This is only one of the reasons why I agree with the use of computers. The reasons are: They provide us with information for learning, they allow us to communicate with people, and they provide entertainment. However, I can understand why someone would oppose them. Let me explain my point of view. Whenever I need to research or know something that I don't know about, I go to my computer and look it up. Many search engines such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 and @LOCATION1 allow us to input a question or phrase and gives us links to other websites that hold information about the topic we are trying to learn about. Another way computers help us learn is because we can download and install software that help us with things like learning a foreign language or even just practicing math. For example, my grandfather wanted to learn how to speak @CAPS4 but he didn't have time to go to classes. So he ordered a program that teaches him how to speak @CAPS4 while he is home. Another reason why I think that computers benefit society is because it allows us to communicate with other people. One way is through social sites where you have a profile and you can ""chat"" with your friends by typing in what you want to say. Another way is through video chat. This is when you have a webcam and you can see and talk to other people. I think that this is very important because @PERCENT1 of people think that computers leads people to become ""anti-social"". It also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away. This can actually improve some people's social life if they are shy. @CAPS2 you like music, movies, and more? Well you have access to them through your computer. This is yet another reason how computers can benefit us. If you are going somewhere that you think your kids will be bored all you have to do (if you have a laptop) is put a movie in for them to watch. Another way that computers provide entertainment is they let us listen to music. If you have an iPod or @NUM1 player you can download the music from the computer. It also provides us with entertainment if we are interested in playing video games. There is entertainment for everyone. Even though I support the use of computers I understand the negative effect they have on many people. Some of those things are: people stop exercising and become over weight, they can become less interactive with other people, and they might not spend as much time in the fresh air. In conclusion, I think that computers can benefit our society. The reason why I think this are: they provide us with information, allow us to communicate, and provide us with entertainment."
382	384	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers have a positive effect on people? I know I @CAPS2. Computers are good for many reasons: @NUM1 reason is because people can learn about far away places; @NUM2 they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @NUM3 they can teach hand eye coordination. First off if you're taking a trip and you want to learn about where you are going, computers can help with that! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you use. You can accomplish many things while talking to friends on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderful things. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurance bill. If you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. Playing certain computer games can help improve these essential skills. So that's why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver.
383	385	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run solely by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 makes you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think creatively. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is especially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This opportunity allows you to immerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than us, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 moved to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immediately started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people thinking the advent of computer has affected communication negatively, I believe that it is an effective tool that everybody should have access to."
384	386	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe this because we can talk to people in different countries in a quarter of a second, we can send e-mails to other people, and finally we can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. First, we can talk to people in different countries. Did you ever have a relative go on vacation in a foreign country and have no way of calling them to see if everything is okay? Lets say for instance that they brought their laptops but forgot their cellphones. Then, the only way we can contact them is by e-mail. Even if your relative is just in another city you can keep in touch through email. You can even use a computer so you can video chat, and not have to wait to get your reply. Next, we can send e-mails to other people. Have you ever sent somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply? Sometimes, your letter is even lost, and there is no way of finding out. Well with e-mail, the wait time of your reply depends on how fast the person whom you are talking to types and most people I know can type a reply in @NUM1 to @NUM2 seconds. I believe that is a great improvement from two to three days. With e-mail there is an eighty three percent chance that your email will not be lost. If for some reason it is lost, there will be a message sent to you telling you that your message was lost and that you need to send a new message. But most likely chances are that your message will reach its destination. Finally, you can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. Were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just cant think of it? If so you probably would be smart to go to @LOCATION1. You can ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. And I mean any question you can ask questions from what the price of milk is in @LOCATION2, to what an elephant is. If you wanted to you could ask math questions as well, such as what is the square root of pi, and what is @NUM3. From @LOCATION1 to myspace the internet is full of information that can have a positive effect on people. This is why I think that the computer has a positive effect on people, we can talk to people in different countries we can send e-mails, and we can ask all sorts of questions.
385	387	1	3	Dear editor, @CAPS1 you know, @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer that do not exercise can develop weight problems and blood disorders? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far. If advances continue that number will increase and other problems could arise from it. Some other problems that we have seen @DATE1 that could get worse are, developing a weak immune system, and emotionally separating yourself from your family. First, lets talk about obesity. Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being, basically, addicted to the computer. Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause you to have a heart attack. Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body. Which leads to, eventually, promote death. Dealing with obesity is bad enough, but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrible. In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally don't have very good immune systems. For example, a friend of mine is on the computer quite often, and has developed a weak immune system. Because of it he misses at least @NUM1 day of school a week. And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keeps bad grades. Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea. So isn't it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea? Especially being that, children are steadily becoming obese, and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable? The emotional distance from family is another serious consequence of excessive computer use. So I urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology.
386	388	1	3	Almost everyone is affected by computers in some sort of way. Some people think computers are bad because some people spend too much time on their computers. The thing is computers help us with our everyday life. If we want to communicate with people from around the world to send donations to places in need like disaster relief zones or international charities, we can use computers to do that. We can change people's lives in third world countries with the help of computers by connecting aid workers and coordinating essential supplies. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it, making the work neat and professional. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer through online libraries and academic journals. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it posted by the teacher. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for businesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file from a secure server. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online, streamlining the entire procurement process. Or when updates are posted about upcoming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that is the user's fault not the computer's. We should choose how long we're using our computers. Many jobs would be impossible without computers, from scientific research to financial management. It's not about overusing them it's about using them responsibly. So overall I say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands, enhancing our capabilities and connecting our world.
387	389	1	3	Dear newspaper, I've read your article about people's opinion on the effects of computers. I believe that having computers are a very good thing. With them we can talk to others from far away, and fast. You can learn a lot too. It also teaches hand-eye coordination. My first reason why they are good is because you can talk to others. Without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily. They even have webcams so you can see each other, making conversations feel more personal and immediate. You can use email services, video chat platforms, webcams, or even a simple comment on facebook or myspace. Video calls or webcams are the quickest and maybe even coolest way to connect face-to-face. Secondly you can learn a great deal. Computers have so many websites that give out a lot of information and recent too. It's much easier to get on the internet and type something in than look through a bunch of books in a library. The internet has dictionaries, news stations, weather, history and where you can find things. With all that you don't even need books for quick facts. They even have maps and you can print out directions for a trip. My final reason is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you first start using computers you're normally pretty young, and sometimes you don't always type the fastest. Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch-screen and wireless mice. So when you first start you normally look down to see what you're writing, later, adults want you to look at the screen when that becomes easy you know that your hand-eye coordination has grown a lot better then when you started. In conclusion I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that they're not bad. They are an easy communication between people, help you learn, and teach good and fast hand-eye coordination in kids, preparing them for a digital future.
388	390	1	3	I think that computers do benefit us. They allow us to interact with people, talk to family far away, help us with school, gives us easy access to information, and much more. People usually have family and friends who live away from each other and the computer allows us to interact with them. The computer lets us email and instant message them, play games against them, be their friend on websites like facebook so you can see recent pictures of them and stay updated on their lives. It's not easy to interact with family and friends who live so far away and the internet allows us to do that almost instantly. The computer doesn't just let you talk to family and friends but it lets you meet new people and interact with new people from all over the world through forums and social networks. It let's you make new friends and play games with them or chat about shared interests. The computer really helps you to just stay in touch with other people and it's a very easy and convenient way to do so. The next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us. Children are very hyper and after homework is done, we don't have anything to do so the computer let's us play games on it, chat with friends, watch movies and videos, upload picture, etc. It does a lot for us. Kids could hang out after school but if they can go on the computer it allows them want to go home where their parents know that they're safe and away from drugs, alcohol, and other bad things they can get into. Just because kids like the computer, that doesn't mean that that's the only thing they do. Kids are very athletic, always playing sports and always hyper but the computer helps that go away by providing a quiet activity. They go to school for hours, then go to basketball or football practice, sometimes we just need a break to relax. The computer isn't always fun but it's very useful. The computer helps us with school. It allows us to type essays and projects neatly. It also allows us easy information to help write the essays. Websites like google and bing are easy websites to help us get good and accurate information about whatever the topic is that we are doing, from science to literature. The computer is very useful when it comes to school assignments and learning. As you can see, the computer is very important in our lives and makes life a lot easy and it's your choice how much you want to spend on it. But no matter what, the computer definitely benefits us by keeping us connected, informed, and entertained.
389	391	1	3	"People should use computers, they do benefit society. More and more people use them today and agree that these virtual portals of information and communication are extremely helpful. Think about it, paper is made out of trees and of course to get the paper you must cut down the tree first, and then have it go through a whole wasteful process to get that paper. If everyone used computers we wouldn't have to cut down those beautifully, lush trees for notepads and books. And also, have you ever needed to get information fast? Well instead of going through a book and possibly searching for hours, finding that information on the internet would be so much faster and more efficient! Lastly, in the future everything will eventually be run with computers, they are the then now and later! They'll never get old! Computers are extremely helpful with endless information at our fingertips. A lot of people today are very sensitive about our environment and how we're treating the earth. They are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible. An easy alternative for paper is a computer. Once for school I was assigned a paper; I looked up the information on the computer easily, typed it up, and sent it by email to my teacher. Not a single piece of paper had been used! Ok so I know, computers use up a lot of energy, but to be honest they don't have to. Many people around the world use solar panels to gain their energy from the sun to power their lights, computers, etc., making computing more sustainable! The use of computers is extremely eco friendly and like I said before is a great alternative to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information fast? Well on the computer you can! All you do is type in what you need in a search engine and instantly you have the info you need! Instead of using a book (which wastes trees) to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job in seconds. A poll was taken and shows that a large percentage of students at local high schools who use the computer to look up information get faster and more accurate results! Do you want that or slow information found in a boring book? The future is not far away. It is already here and we are using the computer for so much. Ok so the computer does show to cause distractions and headaches if used too long, but it is a great invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering from a menu we'll order off computers/touch screens. More and more people are coming up with better and faster computers. Everyone is using computers and love it and they will definitely be used in the future for nearly every task. I hope you see how amazing computers can be. They're environmentally useful and a great alternative to paper, they help you find the information you need fast, and professor grant states ""I do all my work on the computer, without it I would be lost."" And lastly they are the future of our world! They are the then now and later of the technical world, shaping our lives for the better."
390	392	1	3	Many people like computers and like to use them for many different kinds of reasons. Some people use them to get online education. Others use them to talk to family and friends that are far away. Also students use them to do research for school. These are reasons why computers could be good devices. There are many people that now have the ability to get an online education because of problems that they have. For example people that can't walk and don't like going to regular school find it difficult. The computer would help them find websites that they could get a free education from, opening up new opportunities. The computer would see what level they're in like a regular teacher, providing personalized lessons and quizzes. The computer would make it so easy and better for the people that don't have the ability to walk; they can even study for tests that they have on the computer from the comfort of their home. This is one reason why many people use computers. Many families use computers to try to look for friends that they haven't seen in a long time or family that are far away. They even contact them by chatting through websites and social media platforms. They also search for addresses and phone numbers using online directories. Many people get to find their family through the internet, reconnecting lost relatives. They meet in a spot or even come to one another's houses after making contact. The computer would allow their dreams to happen by finding their families, which can be a very emotional journey. This would be an exciting event for them; this is why they need a computer. This is one very important reason. Students use computers to research projects for their classes. Without computers students wouldn't be able to look for information they need to know quickly. The computer would teach students about people in the past they didn't know or didn't get to meet, like historical figures and inventors. The computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history and other subjects. Children need computers to make their intelligence go up higher by accessing a vast repository of knowledge. These are some reasons why I think we all need computers. We need them for people that don't have the ability to walk, for people that have family and friends far away, and for students that would like to learn more about the world. These are all things people enjoy doing on a computer. If there were no computers it would crush everybody's dreams and future prospects. So these are some reasons why many people decide to be on computers, embracing the tools that enrich our modern lives.
391	393	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, our technology is advancing greatly and more inventions are coming out; but aren't you worried that people spend too much time on the technology? I know @CAPS1 is worried. For example, computers. Computers have the technology to go online and chat with various people all around the world. That is when I get worried. In this essay I will explain why it is bad to spend too much time on computers. It is bad because people don't exercise, enjoy mother's nature, and interact with family and friends. Firstly, people are forgetting how important it is to exercise. It is very important because it keeps you fit and healthy. With the computers in use people become less fit and healthy. They start getting fat, their cholesterol gets high, and they stress more. Secondly, they don't enjoy mother's nature. When people start going on the computers they stop doing a lot of things, like going outside and getting fresh air. They get closed in a small bubble and all they care about is the computers. They don't go out to camp, play outside; they don't do anything. Every day they are on the computer. Finally, one big main problem is: they stop interacting with family and friends. When mothers and fathers are on it they don't pay attention to their young ones and they are always on it. When teenagers are on the computers they don't talk to their parents, they ignore their friends and the people that care about them most. They won't care for everybody, but themselves. @CAPS2 there you have it; that is why I think we should cut down on the computer usage. For these following reasons: People stop exercising and being fit. They stop enjoying mother nature, and they stop interacting with family and friends. @CAPS2 what do you think?
392	394	1	3	I think that computers are a good thing to have because most are portable, they're fun to have, and you could research a lot of things on them. Laptops are carry-around computers. They are very convenient to have. You could bring them anywhere you would like, such as to a coffee shop or a library. Many people have laptops in their home or with them. They're fun to have because you could play many games on your free time with them too. Another thing you could do is make videos for school projects or for fun. Last but not least you could just enjoy it by listening to music or watching movies. You could research a lot of things on them. The internet is a very successful product. That means you could use it for your homework if you need help. Another thing is that you could type up essays that you have to do for work and or school, making your assignments look neat and professional. I think computers are good to have because most are portable, they're fun to have, and you could research a lot of things on them, making them a very useful tool for everyone.
393	395	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think that people should try to exercise more than they go on the computer. Computers are one of the main reasons for our nation's obesity rate being as big as it is now, including junk foods like McDonald's. I'm a big fan of computers myself, don't get me wrong. I would be on the computer all night if I could but I don't want my body to get out of shape. I go to bed at @NUM1. I usually stay on the computer for an hour or two, it depends if I'm doing a project. Also, going on the computer less could make your life more fun; instead of sitting inside, go outside and play some sports like football, hang out with your friends, have a @CAPS2 with your family. Do something else than be on the computer. Conclusively, if people just push themselves to stay on the computer for an @NUM2 hour and a half, the obesity will go down. It could also help save our planet by saving the energy used to power the devices.
394	396	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think it's okay for people all over the world to use computers. The reason why I @CAPS1 this is because a lot of people use computers for a lot of things. People all over the world use computers for something important, in case of emergency and much more. Us kids and students in @ORGANIZATION1 use computers to go on Myspace, Facebook, and the chat line to talk to our friends or even to talk to other people in the world. We also talk to our family that lives somewhere far away from the @LOCATION1 or lives here in the @LOCATION1 but in a different state. Lots of us kids go to Myspace to talk to friends, family, people who we don't even know, people from all over the world and people that we haven't seen in years. Well then again, people also use computers to sell drugs which is very bad for our environment. This is one good reason why people are so effective and addictive to their computers because bad people and drug dealers sell drugs over the internet and other bad people and drug dealers buy the drugs over the internet. As far as I know a lot of people over the internet, I also know that the people outside the internet wouldn't do those things and even the people inside the internet wouldn't do those bad things and sell drugs over the internet. The reason why I know this is because they're my friends. They're smart and they just wouldn't do no such thing over the internet or even at all. I tell you again to my local newspaper it is okay for the people around the entire world to use any computer, @CAPS2, @NUM1 or anything as long as they have connection but as for the drug dealers and bad people it is up to them if they want to keep doing what they keep doing because eventually they will end up getting caught and getting brought to jail. I tell you that computers are meant to have fun but not meant to sell drugs over the internet but anyway, they are still useful for good things.
395	397	1	3	"Now-a-days the technological industries are taking over the modern society and are captivating users making them virtually addicted. What good is that? These indulged in the online world are less interactive and showed more signs of depression in recent studies. Also if you are sitting around on the computer all day you aren't burning calories so you are gaining unnecessary weight that could easily be prevented. Going to the library is just as useful if not more useful than going on the internet. Lastly, have you thought of the damaging effects, trojans, cyber bullying, violence? In other words, computers are just a negative waste of good money. Families are becoming less and less connected with each other, who's to blame. It's that big book of technology on your desk. Rather than socializing and just spending time with family and friends, computer addicts choose to sit on their butts talking and gaming away. They are tearing our families apart. ""@CAPS1,"" one @LOCATION1 woman on her two teenage children's computer obsession. ""I swear they're on that thing for hours on end,"" she claims. In an article I was reading the other day it said that most people who suffer depression admitted to being online for at least @NUM1 hours per day. What does all of this go to show? Computers are abuse; take them out of your child's life, or at least limit them. Studies prove that @PERCENT1 of people who spend most of their day surfing the web have either over-weight or are just on the borderline of being over-weight. Rather than going into the real world and experiencing life for themselves, they look it up online and rely on other people's opinions. Does this mean anything to you? People who are overweight have a higher risk of aging, and if not, then they have some pretty serious health problems. All because they didn't want to breathe fresh air and move around. When in a library environment people tend to be more and more on task. You @MONTH1 ask yourself the answer is simply that the internet is too expensive and distracting. If you are in the library you can't get in as much trouble, you can't play online games, or even be looking at things that are inappropriate. Libraries have more credible sources and reliable information to study from. Not to mention you can go with a family, friend or even be tutored. Computers don't provide that. Going to the library is such a better solution. I must admit, I was before a computer addict, and believe me the effects it has on people are atrocious. Now that I've moved on from that period of my life I can honestly say, the addictive grasp it has on you is strong I know. I also know first hand the rewards of being clean from this harmful drug per say. I am more sociable than ever and I'm dealing with issues much better. I am @NUM2 pounds and in the best shape of my life and I even made my school's cheer team. I often go to the library to study and I must say, I'm very proud of who I've become. I was spending around @NUM3 hours online and getting no sleep. If I can do it you can too! My name is @CAPS2 and I'm a computer addiction survivor, and my life is much better for it now."
396	398	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 look at advances in technology over the years and can tell what an immense influence it has had on current day and people. The question is, are these advances for the better? Or will they take a turn for the worst? Today i will be talking to you about technology, and why i think its benefitting society poorly. With people spending less time excercising and enjoying nature, leaving their social life behind by constanly being on the computer, they dont realize how much they're hurting themselves. The number of obese people, especially in children, increases each day. This is caused by a severe lack of excersize because some people are too busy responding to texts, talking on the phone and playing unneeded video games. Not only are they physically harming themselves, but they are definitley missing out on the wonderful aspects of mother nature! Why not get out for a little, escape the technology prison cell you've all been reeled into. The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most beautifuly countries in the world, take advantage of that! Now, without proper excersize, your putting you heart at serious risks. Even doing smaller things, like jumping jacks or cuntups, can help make you and you heart healthy! Your parents, and even your parents parents, are who brought you into this world, faught for you in times of need, and would do anything to protect you. What would you say if i told you technology was pushing them away? Texting at the dinner table while they are trying to make conversation, never leaving you room because you playing ""fun"" games, hiding behind he face of technology all the things a vast number of people do instead of socializaing with the people who matter most: family and friends. Although your friends @MONTH1 be more easy going they still came that your too busy hanging out with you computer to come meet up with them @CAPS3 single person can live without a friend and that friend needs you! Make some time for the people who have a special place in you heart before they disapper. To sum it up, techology is corrupting the minds of human beings... and it need to stop! like i said be healthy and happy and spend enough time with the people you are about who knows, maybe they an make you happier than your electric companion. So, fellow citizens, leap off that desk chair, shut off your electronic devices, and jump back into the real world."
397	399	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have heard that people are thinking of how computers are having a bad effect on people and I disagree. Computers help people so much in schools, work places, and at home. Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers. For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays, letters and so many other writing pieces, and the same goes for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students use computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some @ORGANIZATION1 even more. For example my @CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters. She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can't read it she can't grade it. I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose, soon hand writing will no longer ne required. Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs, for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could ""take control"" of people and people would spend to much time on them. But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time, keeping computers would benefit in so many ways. Writing many different essays, letters, typing for projects, and doing research would be done faster and easier, making them essential tools for modern life."
398	400	1	3	Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1 computers have really change the way people use technology. It has made our society different in many ways. People can look up information faster than ever with this device. People can also talk to friends, especially on popular websites, computers are even used in school, mostly in college. @CAPS1 an advantage of using it in school, means so much to the people and there education, computers have changed the human race forever. When my grandparents went to school, they had no idea what a computer was. their guide was priar knowledge, knowledge from a teacher, or a dictionary. We are so fortunate today to have even computers in our school because my grandparents would have loved to have something as quick and as simple as a computer. @CAPS1 access to a computer can really help people inso many different ways, mainly about the world. What is the first place you would go to talk to people online: @CAPS2. Do you man @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have @CAPS2. The reason why it is so popular paper want to talk to friends that they enjoy talking too. From my experience out from canada have @CAPS2 too, which is surprising. Talking to in country is unbelievable. As you're opportunity for people to make new friend. This can also affect the way people lively. When teenagers attend high school, they have a choice of talking a specific, almost like a helping one classes is because when you are in college, so many in a short amount. I have people who stay up for our their paper. @CAPS1 these are an advantage for everyday life, especially college because it is an oppurtunity for someone to get better at typing computer classes can really help someone trying to learn how to type at a fast pace, and get a caple more hours of sleep! In conclusion, I believe @CAPS1 computers effect our society in a positive way. Thank your for reading this letter, and I hope you can take this into consideration. @CAPS1 computers have dramatically changed lives forever for the better.
399	401	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 paper edattor we should stop because people arent doing anything their just staying home using the computer. Making there life worser they should make a day whith out computors and every one goes out side and gets exsesise. Wo could mapse the world better the more you. Exersise the stronger you get people livse computers because they could there frends play games thats but some time we have to go outside. Some times i like using the computer but a littile to much land that i dont get that mach exesersise and i hope i could stop from that and go out side and exersise more. We would have computers but we wont use it like for along time then spend more outside. We should only olw kids for only two or three hours a day. When there using the computer they use over like hours thats not good they should go out side thats why we need to limit our screen time and encourage more outdoor activities for a healthier lifestyle.
400	402	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a exellent benefit for people. First family friends can communicate from a far distance. Secondly typing on the computer gives people good hand and eye cordnation. Thirdly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. Lastly it gives student a chance to research a topic they are learning about. Well @CAPS1 do you think? Researcher @PERSON1 said that almost @PERCENT1 of family's live faraway from eachother. computers give the ability for familys to communicate wether its aim or a webcam chat. Also out of the @PERCENT1 of familys that live faraway from each other @PERCENT2 use the computer to comunicate. Hand and eye cordination, some people type without looking and some people are really slow. Typing on a computer give the great hand and eye cordination. Good hand and eye cordination could be used for many things. For example, playing sports or even a simple task like throwing something in the trash. Lastly, have you ever wanted to learn about a place faraway from you live or have you ever researched a topic for school? Well I have. Computer give people the ability to learn about places faraway. For example in the third grade I had to research hammer head sharks. Don't teacher always ask their student to look up a word or a topic on the computer? As I have said before I think computers have a benifit on people. I hope that my three reasons of contacting family and friend and hand and eye cordnation and lastly researching has made you think it a good thing too. Thank you for taking time to read @CAPS1 I had to say and I hope you take it into concideration for the positive role they play.
401	403	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. There are many ways computers can have positive effects on humans. First, computers bring people together and let people interact with each other. They let people talk to each other in real time. Computers also let people learn about new things, as the internet has so much information available instantly. Computers also let people do things that they can't do without computers, making them essential tools in modern life. So, overall, computers have a positive effect on people.  Computers let people interact with each other in various ways, effectively bringing people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other, which is much faster than traditional mail. When you need to write a letter to someone, it might take days for them to get it, but with email, they would receive it the second you send it. There are also websites like Facebook that let you talk to your friends; websites like that connect people across great distances. When you and your friend can't meet in person, you just have to get on your computer to chat. Computers also have web cameras, which let people talk to each other face-to-face virtually. You can see them, which lets people see the other person's facial expressions and hear their voice clearly. This experience is better than talking on a phone or writing a letter, and that is why computers are a positive effect on people.  Computers also let you learn about new things whenever you want. To find something out or if you have a question, you can go to the internet for answers. If you ask someone else, they might not know the answer, but a computer often does. Computers let people see pictures and videos from all over the world. If you wanted to see a picture of ancient art that you are learning about, you can go to a computer and type it in; computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Videos let you watch things like something funny to cheer up your day. If you love a show on TV and you missed it, you can often find it on a computer. That is why computers benefit people positively by providing endless learning and entertainment opportunities.  Computers also let you do things that you couldn't do without them, enhancing productivity and creativity. When a teacher asks me to type a paper, I always do it on the computer because it is so much easier. If there were no computers, I would have to use a typewriter, and if I made a mistake, I would have to type the whole page again, which is very inefficient. Computers also allow you to play music easily; you can put a CD in and it will play the music, or you can stream songs online. Computers allow you to do things that simply couldn't be done without them, making everyday tasks simpler and more efficient.  Computers benefit society and have a positive effect on people. They let people interact with each other and they bring people together from all over the globe. They let people talk to each other instantly, no matter the distance. Computers also let you learn about new things, expanding your knowledge with a few clicks. They also let you do things that you couldn't do without them, from writing documents to managing complex data. Computers have many positive effects on people, making our lives more connected, informed, and efficient, so I hope you agree that computers benefit society in a profoundly positive way.
402	404	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have on people are positive, in my opinion. I say that it is positive because what if you're in a rush, and you don't know if you need your rain boots or not? You can check the computer for a quick weather update! I say that it is positive because without the computer, how would most offices run their business? It's too much of a pain to keep everything on paper files, which can be easily lost or damaged. Especially in schools, because the teachers don't keep their grades for students in a filing cabinet anymore! They keep them on the computer, which is much more organized; they'd need a huge filing cabinet otherwise, which is impractical. I could understand why some people think computers have a bad effect on people. They might think that it takes away time from nature, friends, and family. But so many people take their laptops to the local park to sit under a tree on warm days and go on the computer there, blending technology with the outdoors. Especially students do this; they do their homework under the leaves to help them relax while still being productive. Also, people whose family or friends live in other states, they may not have the house number, or they don't have time for a long conversation, they can e-mail them, or use social networking like Facebook, or Myspace to look on their profile pages and say a quick, ""Hello, how are you doing?"" to stay connected. Local shop owner Mrs. Smith says, ""I barely have time for myself! So when I want to say hello to my sister in California, I usually say hello on Facebook because I know how she loves to talk my ear off!"" This shows how computers help maintain relationships even with busy schedules. I remember one morning, when I was rushing before school, I had no idea what type of outfit to wear. I checked the local news casting website for the weather forecast and thank god I did! I would have gotten stuck in a downpour without an umbrella, but the computer helped me stay dry. Computers are also good for if you want to catch up on any news, or just relax and play some games you can, offering both information and leisure. So, if you're wondering about the weather to see if today will be a good day to sit under the trees in the park and catch up on typing that report with your partner, then go ahead and use your computer. But don't forget to e-mail her and ask her first, since you lost her phone number, showing how computers provide practical solutions for everyday problems and help keep our lives running smoothly."
403	405	1	3	According to a recent survey by the National Tech Institute, 8 out of 10 people surveyed in Springfield agree that the use of computers benefits society. I personally concur with these 8 people; computers have a positive effect on people. There are multiple reasons why I think the use of computers really benefits society, including that they can teach good hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Once again, I do believe computers can have a positive effect on people, enhancing various aspects of our daily lives.  First of all, it's a proven fact that most sports and physical exercises involve hand-eye coordination to some extent. The computer can help teach people from a very young age good hand-eye coordination through interactive activities. When a person uses a computer, they have to keep an eye on the screen but still be able to use the mouse or keyboard accurately. This takes a lot of coordination; if you think about it, people don't even love to look at the mouse or keyboard when they are typing, they just know where everything is through practice. People who disagree with what I'm saying often use the excuse that when people spend too much time on the computers they aren't getting enough physical exercise. However, I believe that is not entirely true. The hand-eye coordination people learn on the computer helps to improve their skill and coordination in sports; for example, in baseball, a person has to be looking at the ball to catch it, but at the same time they have to move their arm to catch it. That is where the hand-eye coordination developed on the computer helps, proving that computers can benefit society through teaching people this valuable skill.  In addition to this, over 75 percent of teachers at Lincoln High School believe that computers can be used as a great tool to help students learn and explore the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people they might never encounter otherwise. They give people access to information about a foreign place or people through online encyclopedias or other resource areas. On the computer, one can go to a search site and type in any place in the whole world. Then all they have to do is search, and they have dozens of websites with information about that place and pictures, making learning dynamic and visual. We are a society that is advancing in technology, and people are learning faster and more efficiently with the click of a button. In addition, I think it's also a vital tool in schools; teachers can have students do projects about different countries or people, and the student can easily find the information on the computer. Computers benefit society in the way that they can teach about different locations and people, fostering global awareness and curiosity. Computers can help people become interested in these different topics and may even inspire some people to go to these faraway places or learn about different cultures firsthand.  Finally, 9 out of 10 people asked had some kind of way to contact people online, whether it was through email or Facebook, highlighting the role of computers in social connection. Computers allow people to talk online with other people, bridging distances effortlessly. In our modern society, it is very important that a person has friends, and computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends, especially if they live very far away from you or if you haven't talked to them in a while; connecting with them on the computer is a great way to maintain relationships. Those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. I believe that is just the opposite. Since we are living in modern ages, families understand that when a kid leaves for college, they might be going far away or even across the country. Having a computer allows that family to chat through video calls, providing an easy way to keep in contact and talk with each other regularly. People talking to each other online is just another way how computers benefit society by strengthening personal bonds.  It's now or never to recognize the benefits of computers! They can benefit society in numerous ways. They teach people hand-eye coordination, a skill that can be used all through our lives in various activities. Most importantly, they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, expanding our horizons. Lastly, they allow people to talk online with others, keeping us connected in an increasingly globalized world. We are living in a modern time; society is advancing every day and computers are a huge part of it, driving progress and connectivity. They are having a positive effect on people by making information accessible, fostering communication, and developing essential skills for the future.
404	406	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the overuse of computers because people should be enjoying spending time with family and not on the computer doing nothing; do you agree with me so far? First of all, if you waste all your time being on the computer, there is nothing productive you can get done, as I have noticed many children are on the computer every day right after school, playing games instead of doing homework. For example, my cousin is on the computer everyday doing nothing but wasting his time on pointless activities; are you still with me? Secondly, children should be studying on the computer, not playing video games and going on websites that are not allowed; more than 60 percent of students and children are on the internet playing video games and doing something that is done everyday, which is unproductive. Also, I have seen many kids playing games on the computer for hours, which hurts their grades. Thirdly, students will never learn anything if they waste their time because the computer is for studying, and many students don't use their time wisely as they should; also, many students should be using computers only sometimes, not everyday. I have noticed that so many students don't learn from computers because they are not studying for tests; more than 50 percent of students fail classes because of computer distractions and misuse, which is a serious problem.  First, people should be spending time with family and friends because they are the most important people around us, not computers. Are you still with me? Secondly, friends are the most important people I ever had because they care about and love you like you're their family, but what if you just waste your time on the computer; how will you know all your friends? For example, my friend is always on the computer and never goes to see her friends, and her friends don't come to her because she never cares about them, only the computer; do you get what I'm saying here? Thirdly, family is also more important than just being on the computer because they care about you, and you have to at least spend some time with family. For example, many families stop spending time with each other because the computer is more important to them, leading to weaker family bonds and loneliness.  Lastly, helping your community is a good goal because you make your city look better; you don't want it to be messy. Also, many people quit helping with community service around the neighborhood because they are too busy on computers; for example, I have seen trash on the ground and no one picks it up because they don't care, showing how computers can reduce community engagement. Finally, going out, doing sports, and staying fit is very important for health and happiness. First of all, playing sports is fun and improves your health, but people never play sports anymore just because of computers; for example, a significant number of people stop playing sports due to screen time. Secondly, going outside is very important because it is good for your physical and mental well-being, allowing you to enjoy fresh air and real social interactions, which computers cannot fully replace. We must prioritize real-life connections and activities over excessive computer use to lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.
405	407	1	3	I believe computers have a positive effect on people for many important reasons. They teach valuable hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people, fostering global connections. All these things are good, so why not use computers? We need computers in our modern world to stay informed and connected. Do you think computers are a positive effect or a negative effect? After you hear this, you might want to agree that computers have a positive effect, as they offer numerous benefits for education, work, and social interaction.  Computers have a positive effect in so many ways; for example, they are useful for school assignments, work projects, talking to others, and just getting information quickly from different websites. If we did not have computers or use them,
406	408	1	3	I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. Using the computer affects a person's time because they sit for hours playing online games, it also effects their health because they are not getting any fresh air or spending time with their family, and lastly it effects their education because time they could be using doing their homework they are on their computer. First, using the computer effects a person's time; it does that by wasting hours sitting there when you could be outside playing or doing chores around your house. You could be helping your family or friends out but instead you are playing computer games. There goes all the time you could have been doing something productive, wasted because of the computer. The computer also effects your health because you are in a room inside not getting any fresh air. You are also not exercising and helping your body out. This could effect your emotional health as well. When you are on the computer you are not talking to people and becoming social and you could lose connections with your friends and your family. When you lose your connections and become isolated, you will use your computer more and then the problem will become worse. My last reason is that it effects education because when you could be doing your homework and studying for an important test you are on the computer learning nothing, then you will fail in school and possibly mess up your future forever! This is really bad because you were on the computer. A couple of times I pushed homework aside to use the computer and my grades dropped a lot. So this is why computer use negatively effects education. These are the reasons how the computer effects education, your health, and your time. I know you are thinking that computers could be used for education, but humans prefer fun over anything else and I hope this helped you realize the negative impacts computers can have on our lives.
407	409	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is provided. I am a certain number of years old and I go to a school in a specific location. I am a really smart kid. In my opinion I believe people benefit from using computers. You should keep reading my essay because I am going to tell you several good reasons why I believe people benefit from using computers. My first reason is they teach hand-eye coordination and give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer for research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is whenever I watch a certain program on a particular channel it says that people learn about faraway places and people on the internet a significant percentage of the time. My second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people; for example, when I am on the computer every day I visit a social media site and it always gives me a chance to talk to my friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search a specific website it says that it lets people a large percentage of the time talk to others online. My third reason is it allows students to get information when they are doing a project. For example, when I always use the school computers it allows me to get information for a report, about a particular place and a historical figure, which is why I believe people benefit from using computers. Another example is whenever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get a lot of information when they are doing projects a high percentage of the time. In conclusion, I believe people benefit from using computers because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, allow people to talk online with other people, and allow students to get information when they are doing projects. Those are the several reasons why I believe people benefit from using computers. So please, the local newspaper, please try to make this believable to your readers.
408	410	1	3	"Dear editor, Computers are a waste of time. When kids get home from school they put their schoolwork down and go right on the computer. Computers are wasting the minds of little kids, while others don't even bother to look outside because they are on the computer. If there is only one computer in your house and there are no time limits on how long you can be on, this can cause problems between siblings or adults. If your brother or sister has been on the computer for a really long time and you want to go on and your parents are not around, there probably will be some fighting and yelling. Also, if somebody does something that they weren't supposed to do on the computer and that messes it up, the person that is always fixing it can get really mad. ""It's a nice day outside"" is what a lot of people get from their parents. Most people just waste away the day by sitting on the computer with their favorite snack. A lot of people won't even look outside because they are too lazy to get up off of the computer and go for a walk or maybe play in the snow. My little brothers like to play shooting games on the computer; they are only a few years old! They are twins so they like the same stuff, so they both enjoy the violent actions in games. I'm pretty sure that almost every other boy out there around their age feels the same way. My point is these games are teaching the kids nothing positive. All they are teaching them is how to engage in virtual violence, which does not provide any real-world value and could potentially influence their behavior. I hope my letter showed people that computers can hurt other people and they waste your life; instead of going to the park with your family you are spending that time on the computer. Most of the time computer use has a negative effect on people which is not very good for their development and family relationships."
409	411	1	3	Dear editor of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with “real” people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between certain years, doctors saw nearly a significant increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these contraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by a certain age. Finally, a particular company stated that overuse of computers has led to a very negative effect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen how work gets done faster; however, the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with “real” people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply don’t learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by a specific organization has shown that there are roughly a notable percentage fewer conversations at social gatherings than just a decade ago. This is alarming because at that rate people might never get to know each other and the world might become an electronically based workspace. Finally a social relations professional stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they can’t feel the emotion a person has when he or she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a person’s words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get a considerable percentage fewer workouts, according to a particular publication, which is likely influenced by the overuse of computers. Finally, the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over a specific number in the past ten years. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of technology. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the world’s currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live by encouraging more balanced habits.
410	412	1	3	Dear editor, I believe that using computers is a good thing. They can help you learn about subjects or places you think are interesting that you don't know about. They can help save the environment. These are the reasons why I think using computers is a good thing. First, they can help you learn about new subjects. Say you are doing a report for school on a particular organization, but you didn't know anything about them. You could just go sit at your computer, enter the name in a search engine, and press enter. There you have hundreds, even thousands of entries about the subject. You could sit forever and learn all about these magnificent creations. You can learn about any subject on a computer, at anytime. You could even learn about a computer and all of its history! Second, they can help save the environment. People are always using paper and paper comes from trees. When we cut down trees we are harming our environment. We are depleting our oxygen supply and destroying habitats of animals and insects. If everybody used computers more, we would be using less paper. We could use them to send documents and papers; we could bring them to appointments and for various tasks. Computers could even be used for school work. The teacher could assign the homework, email it to the student, the student could fill it out and email it back. Sure we would still have to use paper for some things, but we would be using it way less. People could also use less fossil fuel for travel by communicating via the internet with tools like video calls. Thirdly, computers could help us advance into the future. Computers can help find ways to do many things such as develop better medical treatments, more efficient travel, and even improve every day life. We could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers. We could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold. Computers could also help us find more efficient ways to travel. They could help find a more efficient fuel or help design new transportation methods. They could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies. Computers could also help us with our every day life. When you get up in the morning, imagine being able to wake up and have a hot shower, your breakfast, and your work equipment all ready within five minutes. That really would be the future of computers. Those are all of my reasons for having computers, from school research to space exploration and beyond.
411	413	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In @CAPS2 opinion, computers are fantastic! Therefore, I believe computers have a great effect on peoples life. Three reasons to support @CAPS2 decision are many jobs use computers, instead of using a dictionary or thesaurus, you can just search it and it is a big help at home/around the house. @CAPS2 first reason is, that many jobs in the state, or nation use a computer. Statistically saying @NUM1 out of @NUM2 jobs in the state use a computer or technology relating to a computer hardware. If you honestly think about it, if you were a teacher preparing lessons, a factory employee operating machinery, etc, you practicly wouldn't even be able to do your job without it. We have learned alot from the new inventions that came about in the past decade, or two. If we have learned anything in the past @NUM3 years, it would be the ""@CAPS1 the time you spend on the computer, but go on because you will learn some things you never know before."" @CAPS2 second reason is we have alot more useful search engines than @NUM3 years ago. In/around the @NUM5's, if you wanted to find information, the only resort was...books. Yes, I mean reading is great, but now having the computer is faster and easier. All you do is go to @ORGANIZATION2 and type in what you want to find. Then it comes up in about @NUM6 seconds with around @NUM7 links to websites to help you out. Just think, now theres no table of contents, just a link and a click! @CAPS2 third reason is it is a big help around the house/at home. In the state of @LOCATION1, about @PERCENT1 of people have a laptop or a computer in their home. But, this isn't a bad thing, because it can help with so many things. Including, help with the children's homework, help with cooking by finding recipes, with organizing bills, anything! Let's say you don't know what time ""@CAPS3's"" friends birthday party starts, no worrys just ask his mom on @CAPS4! Or you need a recipe for dinner, find it on cooks.com. This makes life alot easier and puts a extraordinary effect on your life! In conclusion, having a computer in your life is great, because so many jobs use computers, theres so many searching things, and it is helpful at home. So, computers have a awesome effect on people's lives!!"
412	414	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that computers effect people? I think I @CAPS1 agree that computers affect people. I @CAPS1 agree with this statement because people dont get use to doing other things then stay on the computer. One example is that people that @CAPS1 stay on the computer wont have much fun on other people. They wont enjoy as much by stay on the internet. My last example is that doctors sometimes say its not good for you to stay on the the computer. First of all, people that stay on the computer wont have much fun on othe poeple. I know one of my friends love to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time. One idea in that there not alot to do on a computer for some people, like playing games or watching videos alone. People dont go out and have fun like going to the mall with your friends or playing sports outside. Some people try to focused on the computer if theres something importent they have to do, but they end up missing out on social events. Thirldy, people wont enjoy themselves. When @CAPS2 on the computer I really dont enjoy myself by just sitting there on the internet. One important fact is that you wont want to enjoy a beautiful day with your family when ther going to the beach. People will take maps for a while and not want to go back to sleep and you wont have nothing else to do for the rest of the day. Sometime you wont have a good life without enjoying it with others. Lastly, doctors say its not good for you to always stay on the computer. One important fact is that you always need to excersise instead of lamping around in a chair all day. Sometimes might happen to your eyes because your steading looking at the computer screen for too long. You need to do healthy things to help your body, like going for a walk. In conclusion, I had agree on the statement and my reasons why was because you wont have fun with others. You wont enjoy yourself, and doctors say its not good for you I hope you liked my prompt so it can go in the newspaper.
413	415	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are all around us where ever you go. You can learn things on them or play games. Although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because, harmful people could findout where you live and they are too addicting. Where ever you look you can find a computer. At home, in school, in your car, at work, and hotels. Being exposed to these computers are helpful for tasks. Everything we see now a days is run by or has a computer inside it. In the future we are going to see more and more computers controlling things. Buisnesses practically run off of computers, soon they will run them by thereself without human help. Also with so many computers it creates jobs for people. You can make computers, program them, fix them, and even supervise them doing work. Even though everyone says they are safe on the computer, they are not completely safe. While on a chatting website you could meet someone and they might be a child melestor or a criminal. They can find out where you live and when no one is home or when you are home alone, which is dangerous. With your address they can even look at your house on a website or possibly get your houses blueprints online. Then they can come and leave you mentally scared for life. There are tons of things you can do on a computer. For example you can play games. There are games with virtual worlds or games that are fun and have no meaning. Either way games on the computer are too addicting for many people. You say you are going to play for @NUM1 minutes but they are so addicting you play for @NUM2 hours without noticing. The games just suck you in and your stuck playing. Although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because harmful people can find out where you live and they are too addicting. Computers are good and bad at the same time, depending on use. People need to know when to stop using it or it can drasticly change your life for the worse.
414	416	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly think we should have no more computers rather then looking on the computer. I strongly think this because this could cause serious damage to the eyes from the screen light. My opinion for having computers is I don't think we should have them because you don't get enough exercise from sitting. You would just sit there looking at the computer all day without moving much. You would probley get all fat through the course of the year from not being active. You would be like a couch potato, just staring at the screen. My next opinion is we won't be able to get out of the house to see the beautiful nature outside. Like all the trees, flowers, wild life animals too that you can see. If you don't go outside there will be no fresh air for you to breathe in. My last opinion is if we have computer, we won't be able to hang out with friends and family in person. You wont be able to see how big your family is growing. Or how small they are still small, you would miss it. Well these are my opinion's for having computers and why I think they are not good for us.
415	417	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I think that the effect is good because every place needs them they store thing neatly that way you will know that when you go back it will be neat and saved properly. Every place uses computers they are a big thing in our world. Hotels use them to save who's in each room and to actuvate the room keys for guests, restarunts use them to help make the bill accurate, hospilas use them to store flies so they can be printed heat so the doctor can go to look at them and understand the patient's history. And schools use them they need them to store grades neatly, or for an student to to type up a paper neatly and hand it in they could leave it for the day and go back to it tomorrow to finish. The computer can also be you job, like you workinh on them like fixing them or installing a @ORGANIZATION1 programor app for a client. You can also do your work on it like working on a website or once agin just writing a boper for school or business. The biggest company @MONTH1 need an computer even the @ORGANIZATION1 need them they are big in you company's operations. So even people don't get outside enought the computer help you to make money or be sucsseful in life and once yo got that money thek you will go out side in speed it on activities. So computers have a big effect on schools, communy, stores and many other pplaeces and peoples life, making things more organized and efficient.
416	418	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, my name is @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects of @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout the @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This would help you because at @CAPS1 age people are dependent on computers; they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family, and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most of the time people are satisfied and do benefit from the use of computers. First off, people are affected by computers in a positive way because they can be entertained whether it is playing online games or participating in a fantasy sports league. Although I just mentioned two non-educational examples, there are many educational websites on the internet which children can learn from. In my personal life I can name so many examples of entertainment. I use such as @CAPS2, which is an online game website, or the fantasy football teams I am involved in. Another example of entertainment is when my younger brother, Parker, goes on learning websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is slouching in front of a computer screen he is learning. Also, experts say that children throughout the world learn more from the computer than from a textbook or hearing information from a teacher. They say this because a computer screen catches people's attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child in front of a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. My next reason why the effect of computers on people is positive is because it helps people communicate with friends or family. My brother is attending college and since we do not see him often, our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. Because of this program we are able to stay in touch. An online poll was put out on @DATE1 which asked how people regularly talk to friends or family. Sixty-three percent of the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most of the time. Thirty-two percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. This shows how much people communicate over the computer using Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and much more. I would say that the computer is a good effect on people when used this way. Lastly, computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world. On the computer at my house, every time I open the internet there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6, devastation on @LOCATION5, and much more. Also, a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie-chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fifty-six percent said they found out their news from computers. Not only is it @ORGANIZATION3 students but most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all of his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because of the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and they can receive news about what's happening around the world. Like I said in the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most of them are!
417	419	1	3	The local newspaper wants to know my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers do have an effect on people. People can meet new people, learn about new places, and talk to friends. Read on so you can learn how computers affect people's lives. My first reason is people can meet new people. You can meet new people from all around the world. You can keep in touch with them through @CAPS1 or e-mail. It's a quicker and new way to meet new people and make connections that were not possible before. My second reason is you can learn about new places. You can learn about new places by just clicking on a webpage. Computers are a faster way to learn and explore. They give you everything you need to know about the new places you want to learn about, from maps to historical facts. My third reason is we can talk to friends. Computers have many different social websites that you can use to talk to people. You won't have to wait for school the next day; you can talk to them through the computer instantly. With all this new and quicker technology you can talk to friends whenever you want, no matter where they are. Finally, you now know how computers affect people. We can meet new people, learn about new places, and talk to friends. Computers can do all these things efficiently. I hope you enjoyed reading all about how they affect people and the many ways they connect us.
418	420	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 people, You have been told that using a @CAPS1 can give no knowledge, but I agree that it gives you hand-eye coordination. A @CAPS1 is the most helpful thing in the world. For my first reason, computers have so many technology things inside that help people everyday. I want to talk about interacting with family and friends. You can go on Facebook, Myspace and even Twitter to talk to your friends. It's the most common thing to go on the @CAPS1. About @PERCENT1 of teens and adults use Myspace and Facebook. Little kids, about @PERCENT2, use @CAPS2 to interact with some friends. This technology is the best thing you could ever use for staying connected. The second reason is that people need to learn how to use a @CAPS1 and develop hand-eye coordination. For learning, you could learn how to type, write stories using @ORGANIZATION1 Word, and even learn what to use on the internet. For hand-eye coordination, you can learn all the keys on the keyboard and what they do to get better skills and improve your dexterity. My third reason is how to search on Google or the @LOCATION1. Google is the most common thing that everyone uses. You can look up pictures for projects, labs, basically for anything you need. And for the dictionary, you can see what words mean; the dictionary is for learning and doing homework effectively. For my conclusion, all these reasons are true and computers are the greatest sources on the planet. Everyone, whether you want education or not, computers help everyone in many ways. You gotta love it!?!
419	421	1	3	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I, for one, do not. I think a decent amount of time on the computer can be beneficial, but I do believe that computers are a huge part of people's lives now. I think that people should get off the computer and get some exercise; more and more people would be so much healthier if they took the time they were on the computer and exercised instead. On the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places, nature, and even people. But if people got off the computers and traveled and enjoyed nature, they would be able to live it, not just see a picture. Everything would be so much more fun if you were there and got to experience it, not just read about it or see it on a screen. Another reason why I feel so strongly about people spending less time on computers is because they don't spend much time interacting with family and friends. When you are on the computer too much it seems like you drift away from your friends and family, almost as if you are too ""busy"" to see them in person. This can harm the important relationships in your life. So as you can see, I highly disagree with the overuse of computers and believe it takes away from real-world experiences and connections."
420	422	1	3	Dear, Whoever this concerns, some people are too obsessed with computers. They usually stay up all night playing games or going on @CAPS1. The people who love computers rarely interact with people; they like to be left alone with no one bothering them. Some people that go online to research stuff are probably being lied to; maybe someone's just messing with them and the information is not reliable. If you love computers so much that you stay up all night and don't get any sleep, then you miss work and you get tired; then you know you have a problem so you should quit. You don't want to stay up all night because you could have something important to do and you miss it, like your child's party, because your husband or wife tried to wake you up but you didn't want to go. You miss it and your child never trusts you again. When you stop interacting with other people you really have a problem because you don't want to go anywhere but to get junk food and soda. Computers all the time is bad for you; sometimes you get cranky when someone takes it away, and that is when you need to realize what you are doing and go get some exercise. That is what you need; you got to get some or you end up unhealthy, which is bad for you, and you want to stop that habit and get a new one. When you write a report you tend to go to the internet. It may be a good source but it could be lying and you could turn in the worst report ever. You may have copy and pasted, but you could still not have a reliable source; you should use a good book instead. The internet is a bad thing; it could consume you. Don't use it all the time. The people who make computers should shut all the computers in the world down for one week so we know how it is without the internet and can reconnect with the real world.
421	423	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people in our community use computers for positive ideas. Such as if gives you hand and eye coordination, gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family. This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people. To begin with computers give a positive effect on people because it gives you hand and eye coordination. For example that can help you to have ability to do more. Like work somewhere such as a restaurant. This needs lots of coordination for holding heavy trays. My mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of coordination she tells me. Another reason would be you would have more hand coordination driving because you can react fast. Some people say that computers make you not be able to see while. Which than you would need glasses. But thats their decision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today. Secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places. Why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there. Another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries. Computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad, which also they aren't getting exercise if all their doing is researching when they can do that in their own town. But about @PERCENT1 of kids can still be on the computer than go and get exercise. This is another reason computers are an impact. Lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to their friends or family quicker. For example if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a @NUM1 minute send. Its quicker and easier. Another reason is your kids will be able to talk to their friends faster than mail as well. About @PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to their friends But some people say kids can think their talking to their friends but could be someone bad. But to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its their friend. This is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults, and children, parents. To conclude, I would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and be able to talk to friends. Others disagree because it can ruin your eyes, not get exercise and lastly give your child unsafe. But that can be changed easily by limiting kids, see who they talk to and get them in a sport. This is why I think computers are a positive impact.
422	424	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a very positive effect on people. @CAPS13 reasons are that they can educate @CAPS1, they make things easy, they are enjoyable. Below, I will explain each reason. Firstly, its very educational. Computer are like a giant resource of information. Many teachers @MONTH1 direct their students online @CAPS2 learning purposes. Also, a lot of people go online to research information @CAPS2 their school, job, or a project. Great websites that are packed with information, like @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed using a computer. @CAPS2 example imagine having to do your research using only books, but you live far @CAPS6 a library. The internet makes that research very easy, as you have access to @CAPS7 any time! Secondly, they make things very easy to do. Computer provide people with many easy, convenient ways to do many tasks. If there weren't any computers in the world, don't you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging? Almost all of the @CAPS4/@CAPS5 in the @LOCATION2 like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them to buy things online, which is way more easy than going by car. I remember a time when I wanted to buy something @CAPS6 a store all the way in @LOCATION1 I went online at home and bought @CAPS7 there! Also, @CAPS7 makes things like ordering @CAPS8, getting plane tickets, getting help a lot much easier & @CAPS7 saves time! Thirdly, computers are very enjoyable! They provide a lot of @CAPS17 things to do! @CAPS2 example if you are bored you can get on computer, & search @CAPS2 a game you enjoy. There is always a game you'll like. On top of all of that, you enjoy @CAPS7 by talking to your friends and Family. You stay in touch, while enjoying their company. Another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another, lightning @CAPS10 because of email. Imagine that you don't have a phone, and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip, that your son is very sick. If you send @CAPS7 by mail, @CAPS7 take at least @NUM1 days. By email, only a couple minutes so, you can see that computer also can provide some @CAPS11 of safety @CAPS2 everybody! So, as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @CAPS13 ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @CAPS1 learn. They make things like ordering @CAPS8, getting tickets, or contacting help very easy @CAPS15, they are very enjoyable, @CAPS6 playing @CAPS17 games, to staying in touch with your Friends and Family. Don't you think that without computers we'd probably suffer? I think computers have a great effect on people.
423	425	1	3	"To whom this @MONTH1 concern Computers are a great source of technology, but many people spend too much time on them. People don't get to see the out-side world because they are too ""busy"" on their computers, and use them to find things or play games that they can do just outside in the fresh air. Computers are and people spend too much time on them instead of having an outdoor experience, exercising, and talking and bonding with their family and friends. First of all, people don't enjoy nature as much as they enjoy their computers. When you're stuck inside school or work, you don't get to go outside and see the natural beauty of nature, so when you get out take @NUM1 minutes or so to go and enjoy the wilderness. You don't have to go outside every day, but once in a while it feels good to get out and explore the world. Especially when you had a little break and want to be alone, in nature, you can get away and lose your stress. Some @MONTH1 say you can enjoy nature and explore new places online, and yes you wouldn't you want to do it first-hand? You don't get the real experience by just looking at pictures. You have to be there and explore it by yourself. In nature there is always something new. Secondly, when you are on your computer, you aren't doing anything for your body, you need to go exercise. Fresh air is good for you. Spending most of your time on your computer, you don't spend time with your family and friends. Family is the most important thing in your life, and as you get older, the time you have with your family gets less and less. You also @MONTH1 see your friends in school or at work everyday but you don't really get to sit and ""catch up"" with each other. Online there are programs where you can chat with friends and family, but wouldn't you want to see them personally, especially if you don't see them every week. It's a better experience and you make many more moments. Just going out for a walk or even going on a run can give you time with your loved ones. In conclusion, people spend too much time on their computers. They don't get to experience the outside world and the wonders of nature. The more time on their computers, the less exercise they get and less fresh air. Family and friends are some of the greatest things in your life, don't get to bond with you. Computers are good for using spread sheets and typing essays, but they aren't good for you to spend all your time on, missing out on the adventures your life will venture through."
424	426	1	3	"Dear, @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not. Some people think computers are the lives of many people, but I have to disagree with those who say that. I think that computers benefits our society in three ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. One way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet. Many families do not live close to other relatives, making it hard to see them. But with the internet, people can use social networking sites such as facebook or myspace to keep in touch with one another. Distant relatives can talk and share pictures with one another to keep in touch. Also, the internet can help bring couples together and potentially lead to marriages. How @MONTH1 times have you seen those @CAPS3 harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple? Another way that computers help today's society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic. There are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know. Also, researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books. When using books, to research a topic, you need to find the right book, read the whole thing or at least most of @CAPS2, and find what you're looking for. But with the internet, you just type in what you're looking for, click, and go. Lastly, computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience. By shopping online, you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product. For example, many people rush to stores early in the @TIME1 for huge sales on ""@CAPS4 @DATE1."" A person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product. Why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house? Also, many websites offer special deals for shopping online so you can even save money. In conclusion, I think that computers benefit our society in three ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. A world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today."
425	427	1	3	"To: The @ORGANIZATION1 can be a big part of people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and exercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editors, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinner. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitches, but you don't always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth grade teachers once said, ""@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big french paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!"" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be inaccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should reduce our dependence on computers!"
426	428	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, People spending time on the internet is a good way for people to connect with one another. But it can also be a way for people to get in trouble with things online like looking at inappropriate content, communicating with strangers they shouldn't be talking or typing to, or even encountering predators that could be online. Many kids and adults go on the computer either when they're getting out of school for the day or if they are getting off work for the night; they are just there on the computer to check up on things. For the kids, it's either for their entertainment, for chatting with friends on some kind of messaging program, or they are even playing a game online. Three fourths of kids under age ten go online more than adults age thirty because of their interest in what is on it. People sometimes say, ""oh, I only go on the computer to check up on things. It only takes me a few minutes"", But they are often lying. Most people don't just go on for a couple of minutes; they're on for more like a few hours, and that affects their relationship or connection to one's family and or friends. A specialist at the community center says, ""people spend hours on the computer looking at whatever they want and most people do that and it has to stop for the sake of the person's family and friends."" The specialist also said, ""It's like an addiction"". Do you really want to have an addiction? I didn't think so, so instead of just sitting there staring into a screen for hours a day, go outside and have fun with your friends or family, go to the mall, the beach, or even just take a walk in the park. Nothing can beat the feeling of being with friends or family and just having fun."
427	429	1	3	Computers are great tools and a great piece of modern technology. Almost every family has them. About ninety percent of my class has computers. So many people have them because they're helpful and are another current learning resource. Also it's a great way to keep in touch with friends. Although they can be time consuming, they make up for it in the long run. First, they are helpful because it's quick and easy to get from page to page. It's especially helpful for work because instead of calling a bunch of clients, you can send them all emails in under a few minutes. They also help with school projects or planning a vacation. You can find great low prices on travel agency websites on the computer. This is great because our country is having a bad recession and we need to be saving every penny. These are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful. Next is that it's a great current learning resource. You can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple days before. Sometimes the articles in books are old and outdated. Those outdated articles don't have accurate, more researched information, but computers do, so you can compare your information. Also there are online schools that are affordable. So if you want to get more of an education but you have to work too, this helps a great deal. A computer can be used for many things like learning. Computers are definitely the best way to keep in touch with friends and family that you aren't able to see very often. I know what you're probably thinking, is that well isn't that what phones are for? No, because what if that family member or friend doesn't have a phone? Well then they can use their computer to stay in touch. They can use email, Facebook, AIM, and so many more. A computer helps me stay in touch with people I haven't seen in a while. Okay, now that I've stated all my reasons why computers are a great resource, I just want to remind you that they're helpful, a great learning resource, and a great way to stay in touch. Computers are now an important piece of society. Computers are a whole new track and it should stay that way.
428	430	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and other technology are the best thing that ever happened to the world! I hear that computers affect people, well I don’t agree with that statement. Here are my three reasons why. Computers and other technology make life way easier. Talking to family and friends without spending money is a huge benefit. If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it: we have access to our bank accounts, stores, research, school, etc. See, instead of having to go out shopping for food you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop for clothes and other household items. It's so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. For example, I went to the store to pick up a few items for a party. There was a long line, so I just got online, picked what I wanted and had it shipped to me in less than two hours! It's cool to not have to even get up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have that feeling since you don't wanna get up, but you feel you have to go shopping. Don't computers make life so easy? Secondly, you can talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, and email for free. Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like, Skype, Facebook, Myspace, Yahoo, and even Oovoo. Mostly, all those you can video chat and voice chat for free. All of those sites you can text for free and stay in touch with your loved ones. For example, one day I didn't want to spend my money to talk to my friend. So I just video chatted with them, and it was ten times better because it was free. Even calling people long distance is way too much money, so why not just video chat? I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars on a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you control the amount of time you use on the computer or other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer, everything will be wonderful. You can tell yourself to get off the PC and get a work out or talk to friends in person. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited use of it. If you're the type of person that is easily hooked on something, then maybe you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited time on the computer; my laptop has to be off by a certain time on a school night. And by ten o'clock pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends. There's always ways to not be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. It's not the computer's fault; you just have to control yourself. To wrap this up I would just like to say thank you for having the time to read my letter. My reasons are, computers make life easier, you can talk to family and friends for free, and if you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Thanks again.
429	431	1	3	"Dear officials at the school board, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society, while others argue that they are very helpful. However, the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limits computers are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are affecting the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves 'texting' or ""emailing"" their friends and colleagues. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are becoming less able to talk to others physically and might even be using terms like ""LOL"" and ""BRB"" instead of real words. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social workings of humans and is harming them more than we know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelievable! If someone logs onto the computer to search a fact or ""Google"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computer. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent poll shows that the average person from ages fifteen to twenty-five spends over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wasted on computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use of computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computers watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors but find themselves too busy on their computers to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on Facebook or Oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society rather than helping it. I feel this way because of the social flaws it is teaching people and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are contributing to. If the average person tried to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive change in their life-style!"
430	432	1	3	"Dear Editor, Experts say, ""Seventy percent of teenagers spend three hours or more on the computer daily."" The recommended time limit is one hour. By spending more time on computers people aren't exercising. Secondly, those people aren't enjoying life and nature. Lastly, the use of computer puts a strain on social skills between friends and family. Surely the effects of computers can't be good. First off, people in this country aren't exercising as much as they should. Obesity and diabetes affect over thirty percent of the population. Both of these diseases are lethal. If you spend fewer hours on the computer, these diseases wouldn't spread nearly as fast. When will you get off the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym and exercise so these won't affect you? Secondly, nature is a marvelous thing. Sure, camping in a tent and catching dinner isn't for everyone. But, there are many ways to experience nature without ""roughing it."" You can go to the park or to the aquarium. Sit on your back porch and go bird watching. All of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. Lastly, people aren't spending enough quality time with family and friends. Yes you can email, instant message, Facebook, and Skype family and friends, but it's not the same as in-person interaction. People are becoming less friendly and more isolated, mainly because of declining social skills. We need to practice the art of social interaction without a computer. In conclusion, computers do have a negative effect on people in the long term. People aren't exercising. They aren't enjoying nature. Finally, their bonds between friends and family are weakening. This is a growing problem which must be put to an end. Thank you for your time."
431	433	1	3	"The amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years. Adults and children are spending huge amounts of their time on computers. Though these devices often seem entertaining and helpful, well, that is not all true. Computers are being used for more than just work; it seems to be the people's new way of communication. Communicating with others has always been a great part of our lives. There is not a person in the world who has not had some form of communication with others. Though computers seem to abuse the privilege of communication, for talking on an online chat site is easier and more convenient for people. The people in those chats are not always who they claim to be. This poses a huge danger on those sites, especially since children of all ages are now using them. These children do not always know who they are talking to, but because it's online they say anything that comes into their mind. The way we talk to people in person is not the same online. When communicating with people on the computer the writer tends to shorthand things. Such as the word ""you"" would be spelled ""u"". These quick changes happen without thinking and become a natural habit. These changes quickly become a part of our daily communication and writing. So instead of seeing the sentence ""What did you think about her project"", we will see ""wat did u tink bout her pro."" Because of this, many children's grades could be affected, for their spelling will soon become poor and their vocabulary will be limited or all in slang. This vocabulary change could be prevented if computers were not used as much. Today we are seeing less of people going outside. No one ever needs to go anywhere if all their communication can be done at home. This isn't just hurting ourselves but also the environment. The less time people spend outside the more energy is being wasted inside homes. The times we do go outside is for simple tasks such as taking out the trash. This is hurting our environment! There are not as many people taking care of our planet. People are not taking the time to make a garden, plant some trees, or simply pick up some trash on the side of the road. If we would all just take the time, maybe only ten minutes a day to help our environment, it would be helping our bodies and also helping our planet. This would reduce the amount of people using computers and change the way we see our civilization today. So please help yourselves and the earth; stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive. The computer will always be there, but we only have one of us and one of our planet. We don't want to destroy these over a simple piece of technology."
432	434	1	3	I think we need our computers. If we don't have computers we won't be able to connect to our family that could live in another state or country. I know how there is texting now, but some people don't even have phones or anything; how can you connect to them? You can't call; it might not be free with the phone plan you have. If a family member comes and visits you, they would probably email you about it, but if there are no computers they can't tell you when they're coming. Are they going to show up unexpectedly? They might not even be home, and if they show up without them knowing, they are out of luck. And we exercise on our own time; we pick what time and we do it, and if we play a sport we're enjoying nature. Some people might have jobs that take place outside, too. There are nerds that are on computers all day long, but I'm sure they enjoy nature; I don't know about exercising, but they have a car and everything; they drive and things. Also, about the exercising, everyone has to exercise to stay in shape; I'm pretty sure people don't want to be fat their whole life; they want to look good and feel good about themselves. If it is a holiday or something and people want to send them something to wish them a happy holiday or whatever, they're not gonna be able to see them in person if they live so far away unless they plan to meet each other, but even if they do that, they're gonna want to email them, not call where it costs money, and texting only comes with certain plans for phones, so all there is left is emailing. Sometimes, people will moan that you're always on the computer; if you're not, don't worry, at least you get to email your family that you don't ever see. These reasons are my opinion that we should not get rid of computers and other such things.
433	435	1	3	Most adults believe that computers are just a waste of time and are sometimes can be addicting or bad for health. Well, it's true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socializing with friends, family, or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers? Well, you can do this safely and harmlessly over the computer, and you also learn a lot about life or other people's lives outside your small little town. There is another great perk with computers, and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to college for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and see pictures of her every day. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of people you actually really need to talk to, such as friends, teachers, or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to socialize, it will always feel like you're never alone, which is an awesome thing. There are many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actual important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example: everyone has forgotten their work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well, with being able to just grab all the papers offline is easy. Just go to your teacher's home page and just print your homework. It's that easy; just one click and that saved you a twenty-minute ride to school. How about when you're up at night wondering what the weather is going to be like, maybe sunny, cold, or even a glorious snow day? Well, instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything: maps, forecast, or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather, people always want to know breaking news. Why watch a two-hour show when you can just get to the point of what's happening in this world we live in? I mean, the parents have to open their eyes and see this is a beautiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created something so complex and interesting. There is one more topic that I know you're going to absolutely love. I mean, right now you're grading this in your office; well, you can be grading this at home on your comfortable couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the world. People work from home all the time; you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns a company and works from home most days. It's absolutely wonderful that he is able to take me out, spend time with the family, and most importantly doing the things he loves, and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying, it's only a click away; here is another topic: online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that boring accountant and spend hours there? Well, now you don't have to waste your time; you can type in a couple keys and boom, you're on your way to see your information. That was faster than two hours, I'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a good use of time and will also help a lot in the future. So the next time you log on to your computer, do some of these things and trust me, you will think exactly what I think.
434	436	1	3	"Dear Readers of the Local Newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree with those experts because many people take the computer seriously and always want to be on. Though the frequent users think there is nothing negative about using the computers, there is, such as increased light bill payment, obesity, and, like the experts said, ""less time interacting with family and friends."" First, frequent users of the computer cause a high light bill because if the user is constantly on, then the computer must constantly be on; when the computer is constantly on, it causes the light bill to increase. I can connect to that because I used to be a frequent user of the computer and my guardian would yell at me because of it. Ever since I had brought down the habit of being a frequent user, my guardian has stated the light bill has decreased. Another reason why frequent users of the computer must decrease their habit is because of obesity. Obesity is when a man or woman is overweight. My imaginary friend is a frequent user in my imagination. He is like many others; he never exercises with his friends because he is constantly on the computer. Last but not least, frequent users begin to slack on interacting with friends and family. As I stated in paragraph two, I used to be a frequent user. I myself wouldn't accept invitations to go to the movies with friends, and I wouldn't help around the house. These were the main three things I wouldn't do. Then I learned to not abuse the computer, not waste my time on it, but I also learned to be responsible with it. That's what I think many frequent users should do, too. In conclusion, being a constant user is not healthy because it may cause obesity, increase your light bill, and means you won't spend time interacting with loved ones."
435	437	1	3	The school board, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they don't enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. Three out of four people in my school agree that they hardly exercise anymore because they are always on their computers. For example, a fifteen-year-old girl used to go to the gym every day before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exercise. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatoes! I'm sure you don't want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didn't because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends, many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exercising. They are on so much they don't enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers aren't good for our community.
436	438	1	3	Dear newspaper, People are spending too much time on their computers. They are on the computers when they should be exercising, leading to a more sedentary lifestyle. People need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends. Let me explain more. Firstly, the people who are constantly emailing people, facebooking people, or on myspace aren't getting exercise. Now, more than ever people are becoming very obese. It is very unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and becoming overweight as a result. Eight out of ten computer users aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers, they don't sit back, relax and take in nature. People don't get that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinct they are not coming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone. Computers are the wall between inside and going outside to look at the world. Finally, the computers are getting in the way of seeing family and friends. Everyone is so caught up in the newest computer they don't see their friends or family. I know some people who when its time for dinner, they walk down to the kitchen. Get their food and bring it to their computer so they don't miss out on anything. Family and friends are very important. A large percentage of people only see friends and family on holidays. Computers are getting in the way of everything! People aren't getting the exercise they need. They aren't going outside to enjoy the nature and they aren't seeing their friends and family. We need to get people off their butts and away from the computer. Why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway? It is time to reclaim our lives from these machines.
437	439	1	3	What I am going to tell you could change the way you think about computers in general. People might say that computers are great to be on; it's fast and you get what you need, but I think computers are not good. They become addicting and make your bills every high, computers can lead to your child spending less time with you and your family, also computers can be very dangerous for teens and children of all ages. I say that computers are addicting; this is a fact that a significant percentage of students spend most of their time on the computer. Why are computers so addicting? Well they have instant message; you can talk to people around the world. Now I know it might not sound bad but this can be bad for your pocket. An expert who works with electric bills says that because children spend more time on the computer the bills in house have grown up almost a considerable amount and the harder it is for people to pay their bills. Computers are, what they say now a days, one of the main reason children spend less time with their family. This is true in most families like mine because of computers me and my sisters spend more time on the computer than with each other; this can cause arguing and fighting between families. Statistics show that a large number of people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with their own children or parents. Is this what you want for you and your children, to be separated by technology? Computers aren't always safe for teens and children of all ages. There are many reasons why computers can sometimes not be safe for your children or teens. I say this because sometimes we are worried about our kids safety and when your child is on the computer you have no idea who they are talking to or what they are talking about. Teens are most likely going to meet other people online and there are stalkers, posers, and other people out there that are pretending to be someone they are not and your child can be one of those people who fall for it and it can lead to meeting someone they might not know and they can be kidnapped, raped, anything can happen. Children can also get hurt by verbal abuse; they can be threatened by others and hurt and that can cause emotional damage so be careful and monitor your child. These are just very few things that can happen. These are my reasons computers aren't really benefiting our society as much as people claim.
438	440	1	3	Dear School Board, I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people because, you could get obsessed with the computer. You could get in trouble, and it could effect your education. One reason I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it. For example, if you were playing outside on a nice day and you called a friend and asked them to come over and they said no I can't because I am on the computer. You said why todays a nice day. Then your friend said they are playing games. Thats an example of being obsessed with a computer. Another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble. Getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer, or you might access inappropriate content. Also if your parents found out you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded. That means you wouldnt be able to use the computer for a long time. My last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could effect your education. If someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could effect their grades a lot. If you are in high school and this happens you wouldnt be allowed to graduate and go to college. That is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college. Even though the computer is important in high school you still shouldn't be on it to long. In conclusion everything I have said about why being on the computer too long is bad for you proves that too much computer is bad for people and their development.
439	441	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become a major part of peoples lives. The effects computers have on people are only negative. Nothing good comes out of using a computer. This is because computers are time consuming from other activities, computers are not always working which leads to people getting angry, and using computers is bad for your health. I know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what I have to say, there will be no doubt that you will agree. Using computers is very time consuming. People don't realize how long they have been using the computer. Once you start using it, you're hooked and it's hard to stop. A poll was taken and out of a group of kids, many of them said they felt groggy and had headaches, after using a computer for two hours. The way computers make you feel is not enjoyable. But while you're using the computer it's entertaining, for example, you're on a social media site and you're talking to your friend and you're laughing at them & enjoying yourself, but it's not the computer that's making you happy, it's the person; you might as well see them in person. Therefore, computers are time consuming & should not be used. Computers are not reliable, they have minds of their own. Many people do always rely on their computer and when it doesn't work it causes the person to get angry or frustrated. Computers have a vast impact on people, but they shouldn't have to. A doctor at a university says that a high percentage of people's frustration & anger is caused by non-working computers. If the use of computers was lowered, anger that people have would lower and would lead to other positive things as well. Furthermore, computers are not reliable and cause people to get angry. My final reason is that, computers cause health issues and cause people to be lazy. The obesity rate is higher than ever and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping. A significant portion of obesity is caused by the use of computers. A health expert at a research institute says that a majority of people who don't use computers are much healthier because instead of using computers they exercise. Therefore, computers cause health issues. In conclusion, computers effect people because they are time consuming, you can't rely on them and it's bad for your health. Therefore, computers have negative effects on people and their well-being.
440	442	1	3	"Dear Community, Imagine one day being able to talk to anyone in the world by simply pushing a button. This has became possible with the computer. I support the advances in technology because computer can help hand eye coordination, it is easy to learn about faraway places or people, and the computer enables you to talk online. This is why I support the computer. First, the computer benefits society because it develops hand eye coordination. Did you know that nine out of ten people who use a computer have improved hand eye coordination. A prominent tech creator, ""The keyboard is the most important part of the computer because it builds hand eye coordination."" This reminds me of when I got my first computer and had no hand eye coordination. Now I can type with my eyes closed. I understand how you might think that computers cause people to not get enough exercise, however, the computer can improve your hand eye coordination. This is why I support the computers. Next I support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people. Did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer when they need to learn about a place or a person. An educator stated, ""The way students study is much different than it used to be, now students use computers."" This reminds me of when recently I had a report to do on a historical figure and all I needed was my computer. I see how you might think that enjoying nature is important, intelligence is even more important. This is why the computer supports our society. Finally, I support the computer because you can talk to the world instantly. Did you know that ninety-nine out of one hundred students talk online to stay in touch. The creator of a popular instant messaging website stated, ""There is no doubt that this service is the easiest way to stay in touch."" This reminds me of when I went away on vacation and still stayed in touch with my friends through messaging. I understand how exercise is essential to your body, however, talking with friends is important too. This is why I support the computer. In conclusion, I support the computer because it supports hand eye coordination, you can learn about faraway places and people, and you can communicate with people around the world. Now that you know why I support the computer there should be no doubt that you will support it too."
441	443	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 I support that computers have a positive effect on people because they have so many things to do and learn on the computer, because on the computer you can look up many things like sports, animal world history and a lot more. The reason I support this is because I like to look up history about @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 pioneer who have changed humanity. The other reason why I say computer effect people is because it teaches you how to type faster and know now to get certain places on the computer for example say you mom was asked you do you know how to get to a certain website to buy new furniture. Another reason of how computers effect people is if say one day you had to do a project, on what happen during @CAPS2 revolution and you were one of those people that spend all their time looking up @CAPS2 revolution on the computer. That means that project should be real easy. The next reason why I say computers affect people is because they teache better communicating skills on things like facebook and @CAPS5, because when I'm in school kids tell each other to go on there facebook when they get home. I also think computer affect people because say you have a idol and wan't to look up that person for example I like football, basketball and my idols are @PERSON1 peterson and @PERSON2 iverson, so everytime I go on the computer I look up both of my idols. My last reason why I say computers effect people are because they teach how to read because everytime on the computer haves something to read about no matter what it is. In summary, computers provide many benefits for learning and daily life.
442	444	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 a computer @CAPS15?"" @CAPS2ís a continous subject and many controveries and ideas have been made, like senior scientis @PERSON2, I believe that computer can be used to help people connect with friends, long distant relatives"" says @PERSON2. @PERSON2 is right, computers bring people together whether its friends families or relatives from far countries. It also helps with everyday needs like and homework. First off people can do many things on a computer, including homework finding a store and checking out traffic and weather. You can play games, connect with friends learn recipies and react if the wreckers the football game. By creating a link all around the world people can find out information about one another and learn what they are all about. A large percentage of large corporations find the internet and computer very useful. ""By using the internet I can find a willing participant in charities"" says @PERSON4, charity fund raiser in @LOCATION1. Second, by using the internet people can share their wares on many sites including @CAPS6 and @CAPS7. People also create websites to share their wares, @PERSON1 the co-owner of The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, a duct tape wallet company that also raises money for @LOCATION2, has started to create a website, and hopes to raise awareness of the terrible event that happened."" People like @PERSON1 use the internet to expand their buisness. ""Why stay in the past, when the door to the future is open?"" says @PERSON3, the succesful owner of @ORGANIZATION1. By using computers, people can gather data from others and create new inventions to help the world. People can create detailed diagrams on a computer and send the data to a company, and hopefully create something new. Computers arent just same plaything, they are serious pieces of equipment that can help the world. Although some people might find the down sides to computers, they will always be able to think of a good side. I hope that you will use this article to prove that computers arent all bad."
443	445	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, In my opinion I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers because if we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people often have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because if we need help on something we can find it on the computer. For example, if a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the topic they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what they are studying. Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. When I say this I mean like if you have a computer you can connect with them on the computer. For example like if you have a gmail, facebook, yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there. I do it all the time. Last reason why I that we should use computer is because sometimes you often have to go on the computer for example if you had important message the website and you message you. I do it why can't you. So yes I do think we should use computers for these important reasons.
444	446	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer. Just imagine, more people outside and healthy. Less ìcyberspaceî bullying, and less burning of electricity. My first reason why people should spend less time on the computer and more outside is because a significant percentage of people that use the computer more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or are overweight. Also, @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says ìSome people believe that using the computer gives you benefits, but they donít. They increase your chances of either being overweight or getting diseases such as diebeties. Itís imperative that the community takes action to stop this from happening. ìIn addition, my neighbor, @PERSON2 had to do a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers. He told me that a large portion of the people he interviewed said they donít go outside and use the computer for about several hours a day! I implore the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature. My second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying. A high number of people that use the socializing websites have experienced more than a few encounters of cyberbullying also my sisters friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on advil so she ran comitt suicside because of cyber bullying. Someone had said she was ugly, smelled and should ""go die in a hole."" She didn't tell anyone about this. Luckily her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fast enough to be put on life support for many hours. furthermore, if people cut down on internet socializing website than less people will be in danger of cyberbullying affecting their lives. It's excruciating imperative for people to use the computer for only a couple of hours a day. My final reason is, the less time you use your computer the less money you would be wasting on electricity bills and spending more time on family vacations. Dr. @DR1, from the peabody museum in @LOCATION2 begs people to use less electricity and power on the internet so the environment can slowly rebuild itself to be what it was before technology and electricity was invented. In addition, a lot of power used in todays homes is used on computers. Also my grandmother is astounded by what todays technology is doing to the environment and the people behind this madness or electricity. She believes that the less time on the computer means more time on family vacations and with friends. Lastly, it's extremly imperative that people stop using computers as much to help their health their self estem and environment. We must take action to stop using computer excessively. Thank you for reading my paper."
445	447	1	3	"Dear newspaper, In my opinion, computers definetely have a negative effect on people. People who use computers often spend less time exercising. I mean, who would give up their chatrooms and games to get in shape? I remember when i was a little girl - about @NUM1 years old, and i always wanted to be on the computer. I soon got chubby and gained about @NUM2 lbs! I quickly realized the computer is a tool used only when necessary. because it shortens activity time. A survey done by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) showed that a high percentage of children between ages @NUM3 are overweight because of their computer use. Famous singer @PERSON2 says. ""I keep going and losing weight because of computers! I will gain weight and then run it off and ignore the computer for a week."" I know you might be thinking that computers dont make you obese if you use it sparingly, but research has proven that more than @NUM4 mins a day can make you gain fat. Clearly, computers are to blame for our society's weight problem. Have you ever really seen nature's beauty? People who use computers don't! I mean, people are too busy looking up things on the web that nobody can truly appreciate the outside world. I remember when i watched the movie @CAPS2 last week, I thought to myself, ""Wow, nature is amazing, why didn't I notice before?"" I already know the answer. Computer, A survey conducted by @NUM5 grade @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 showed that many out of those children have never noticed the blooming flowers or the smell of fresh rain. Famous physician, @PERSON4, ""Children that dont see nature for its true beauty often can't grow up normally. People were supposed to be naked to nature, but over the years, technology has diminished that connection."" I know you think that that children see enough of nature even with computers but more than often, children dont pay attention to nature. They are too busy with computers. Obviously, nature is ignored by society because of computers. Familes grow more and more detached every time a child or even adult uses a computer. I mean, every time you hit that on switch, you and the computer become attached. You can't focus on the people around you. I remember when my sister @PERSON5 was in @NUM5 grade, she never took her eyes off the computer. She would play solitore and instant message her friends all the time and she then completely disconnected with the family. A test done by @ORGANIZATION3 showed that teens will rebel more than usual with the aid of a computer. Famous talk-show host, @PERSON3 says, ""Children shouldn't use computer, they will get detached from friends and family."" I know you're thinking children dont get detached, but they do. Clearly children seperate from their friends and family because of computers. In conclusion, any far minded person can tell that computers have a negative effect on people because they consume exercise time, make children forget about nature, and seperate family and friends. Therefore, I urge you to not use computers for the sake of your health and relationships."
446	448	1	3	"Computers are very enhanced pieces of machinery that provide significant benefits. With this high-powered object comes knowledge of many different places and what is happening around the world, offering immediate access to global events. Next, typing is a universal way of writing that is much faster than hand-written pieces, allowing for efficient communication and document creation. Lastly, online gaming is a convenient and fun way to relieve stress by interacting with other users around the world. There are thousands of news stories, every day of the year that do not ultimately get covered because of limited air time on news channels. To quickly and simply get your news from around the world you can visit a website and look at hundreds of stories at the click of a button. To add to that, you will get more in-depth news for there is no limit on room or space on the website. There will even be areas on the website to donate to those that need assistance. Patrick Millin, founder of the Global Aid Network, stated, ""Online donations bring in billions of dollars in aid to people who otherwise would be in deep trouble, and the main source of all of this money is from internet websites."" Without the internet, millions of people would not even know about these people who desperately need help. Typing is a quick and fairly simple way to write, that saves people valuable time. Teachers often assign writing homework, which takes about twice as long to hand-write other than type. Using typing would save you this time and allow you to continue on with other important tasks that are needed to be completed. Furthermore, typing is a mandatory class for many freshmen and previous experience is very helpful to the teachers and students. ""I've had many students,"" says typing instructor Mrs. Gable, ""and the ones that excel not only get an 'A', but also cut their homework time in half."" Stress is a common problem in all age groups, and a computer is the best way to relieve it. Interactive games with people around the world will broaden your spectrum to other cultures. You may use your typing skills to talk with others, and share your opinions with them. ""The results of a September study seemed a shock,"" says Dr. Evans at the National Research Institute, ""but people who use computers an hour a day are much more culturally advanced than the others."" To add to that, you can use video chat to talk to people in foreign areas. Friends, family, and exchange students are able to talk and see you through video chat. This greatly reduces parental worry for their children living in a foreign country, demonstrating the profound and positive impact computers have on many people."
447	449	1	3	Computers are good because people can find what they need and they are fun. They allow users to ask questions, find places, and get things for a good price with ease and efficiency. This accessibility makes daily tasks simpler and more convenient for everyone involved. The ability to quickly locate information and compare prices online saves both time and money, which is a significant advantage in our fast-paced world. Ultimately, computers serve as powerful tools that enhance our ability to navigate and manage our lives effectively.
448	450	1	3	Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things, people are able to do research, talk to people such as friends and family, and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way too much time becoming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it, and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can permanently damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capability to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. That's what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can permanently damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people, highlighting the importance of using this technology in a balanced and mindful way.
449	451	1	3	"Dear Health Council, I believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing productive things. For a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives. Another reason is, if you need a healthy work-out or healthy eating tips, you can just print them out. And my last reason is if you're going on a far away trip but you don't know the way, you can just print out directions easily. Say if you have a relative that lives all the way in Australia but you can't call them because you live all the way in the United States. And if you call them, it'll cost you about five dollars per minute. What you can do is you can contact them over the computer using a webcam. And it's way better than just calling them because you can actually see them. Or if your on a business trip away from home, you can check upon your family. My second reason is, you can stay fit while being on the computer. You can look up healthy ""yoga"" poses. Or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer. And if you're on a diet, you can look up healthy recipes. You can also get affordable work-out equipment that'll make, or keep you, nice and slim. My last reason is that if you're going on a long journey away from home you need to know the way. But, what if you don't know the way? You can go on the internet and look up directions. And that is way better because at least you aren't wasting money on a expensive GPS device. And it is more efficient and quicker. And the best part is that you don't have to keep looking at the device and program stuff. With the maps on the computer, you can print it out and actually keep it. Those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers. There are many things that a computer can do which is really good. You can communicate with relatives, stay fit and healthy while on the computer, and get reliable maps. I hope that this opens up many people's eyes to the positive uses of computers, encouraging a more productive and connected lifestyle."
450	452	1	3	Should there be computers in our society? Yes, there should be; computers are good things and are a good help. I can give you three good reasons why: paying bills, social media, and research. This is why computers are good. My first reason why computers are good is because people need to pay bills; it's easier to pay your bills online than to do all the paper work, and it makes it faster for people and computers are really good for them, that's why we need computers. My second reason why we need computers is because people have social media like Facebook. And that's a good way to talk to friends, and get new friends and its fun to have Facebook and just interact with people and that is why computers are good in society. My third reason why we should have computers in our society is because of research and the need to get information; a computer is really good help for that, they are great help for research like a specific topic as the computer has all that information readily available. In conclusion, having computers is really good because of paying your bills, social connectivity, and research capabilities, so people need computers for these essential modern tasks. I have told you all the good things about computers, and now perhaps you can consider their value in your own daily life.
451	453	1	3	Dear local newspaper, It has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people. In the past there have been more negative effects on people. In a survey taken in several magazines, it showed that a large percentage of people have negative effects with computers. In my opinion, I think computers have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. It is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer you are not really interacting with anyone. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at a local community center, it showed that a significant number of people are on the computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents do not see their kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move and be active. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy for them. Computers take them away from hanging out with family and friends. Secondly, people do not get to enjoy nature. People on the computer might not go outside because they are so involved with the computer. Staying in one room doing things for hours on end is not healthy; every once in a while people need fresh air. Learning about nature is more beneficial when experienced directly. If you do not enjoy nature you do not know what is going on in the world around you. Nature is all around us and why would you miss out on it. In a survey taken in a local magazine, it showed that many people are on the computer and miss the outdoors. While people enjoy computers, nature is being neglected. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers the less people exercise. America is over weight already and people on computers mostly just long to become over weight. People would rather play on the computer than get exercise for a healthy body. Dr. Smith, a local doctor, has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less as computers are doing more harm than good. In conclusion, I think computers have a negative effect on people. My three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family, not enjoying nature and getting less exercise. I urge you to be aware of the negative effects on people. The newspaper's important decision is up to you.
452	454	1	3	Dear Editor of the Daily News, To start off I would like to give my opinion on using computers too much. Although I use a computer a lot I still have fun with friends and play sports. But too much time on the computer can cause you not wanting to get exercise or maybe getting sick easier. Spending so much time on the computer can cause a kid to be shy in the outside life. Exercising is very healthy for kids and adults. There are way too many people on computers doing anything you can think of for hours. Staring at a computer screen for a long amount of time will not keep you fit or in shape. People should have a minimal amount of time of sixty minutes each day and then get some exercise. This way you would get time for being on the internet and still doing what's good for you. I shouldn't feel bad about the people who waste all their time on the computer but I do. To see them getting gross and gaining weight from lack of exercise makes me want to help them; no one should put themselves into that kind of situation. What I've noticed about people who stay online a lot is that they get sick more often. From sitting there like lazy bums they do not get fresh-air. Not getting enough fresh-air can cause a cold or for some people with health problems to get very sick. They need to think twice about what they are getting themselves into. I would rather be having fun and getting nice fresh-air than sitting on the computer about to be sick. It can be a different story if you went home sick from work or school and went on the computer, but being sick from the computer is gross. Even though it is hard to say, people who are on the computer often are shy in person. If someone gets in a fight on the internet that can cause them so much pain to not even talk. Interacting with people is very nice and touching. But being shy and lonely because of a fight on the computer or from being on it too much, is something to be ashamed of; you should not have to be that way because of one thing. Get out in the world and do not let things like that get to you. To finish this off, it would be nice for people to take care of themselves and not stay on the internet for so long. Remind yourself to have at least sixty minutes to yourself and to do what you want but get some exercise also. Do not forget about staying healthy and going for a jog once in a while. You should not focus your life on your computer. Thank you and have a great day.
453	455	1	3	People are probably on the computers chatting, checking their e-mail, or making a website, or they are on YouTube. Maybe the person does not like to go outside and enjoy nature or spend time with their family; they are probably checking out new websites and playing games, or they are probably on the computer to book their vacations or see what is on sale at Walmart. They are probably looking at or buying a new truck, or they are looking at the history on all the wars and how they were started. These activities keep them indoors and disconnected from the physical world and the people in it, which can lead to a more isolated and sedentary lifestyle over time.
454	456	1	3	I think computers work well because they help people with their own work. But computers do make people addicted because you mostly could do anything, but mostly computers were able to be used for help like work, maps, and finding out problems; for school it helps them with math, science, social studies and a lot more things. But people abuse it like their video games and they do not even go outside; they do not talk to their friends or even see their friends; it is mostly not having a life. And people do not feel like going to school because they are over-tired and they just want to use the computer all day without stopping. And so I think that people are just too addicted to computers; they do not use it for the right reasons. Then people get sick; they could get headaches or they feel like puking. And they do not get to see other things like go to the park, see a football game, soccer, baseball, volleyball, or even take their own dog for a walk at the park. A lot of people buy computers for games and entertainment, or more mature people buy computers for their work and to find where places are, so the computer helps a lot but it addicts a lot of people. And computers do really break often because people could download a game or something and then it gives it a virus. So you mostly spend about one hundred dollars or two hundred dollars to fix it. And new computers come out and they cost a lot, and they are different just from brand to brand and they go about more faster. And when people's computer breaks some go crazy and feel like doing some crazy stuff. They do not feel like they have friends; they only stay in the room forever and they never go out at all, and if they do come out of the room they instantly do not respect their parents; they do whatever they feel like doing and then they act out and get into troubles. So computers do help out sometimes, but they do not other times, but maybe we should make different changes to how we use them.
455	457	1	3	Welcome to the 21st Century. In this day and age, numerous advances in technology are being made every day. The one advance that has stood out above the rest is the invention of the computer. For just one invention, the computer has many capabilities: internet access for educational purposes, keeping people in touch, and opening people up to new aspects of life. The computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world. As far as many can see, this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere, every day. The new trend in schools all around the globe is the addition of computers or a computer lab. The reason for this is that this technology takes learning to places it has never gone before. Whether a student has to write an essay about the presidency of Abraham Lincoln or obtain background information for a science experiment about paper towel absorbency, a computer can aid them in finding the information they need. Programs like presentation software allow students to present their work in a new and efficient way. For children that are home-schooled or adults that want a college education, computers let them learn what they need to from online schools. It is also important to note that they can keep in touch with friends after school hours. Computers are able to help them with this. How many times has it been said that communication is key to a healthy relationship? Computers, believe it or not, are an easy way to maintain contact with far away people. Some friends and family keep in touch completely by computer because they do not live close enough to visit daily. If one is cautious and uses internet safety techniques they can make new friends with common interests through computers. This contact with new people is just one way that a computer can broaden one's horizons. Computers are like keys; they open doors to new places and ideas. The use of this technology can help people in discovering so many new things they have never known before. Computers can help open people up to unique genres of music they have never listened to before. On the internet, there are many video tutorials that teach people different skills for free. In one's spare time, they could use a computer to research the people of ancient Egypt or the pyramids of Giza. Any way a computer is used has the potential to have a positive effect on someone. In the 21st Century, computers are essential to every day life. It is imperative that you decide whether you are for this remarkable piece of technology or against it. It is astounding what you could learn from just hopping on a computer. Especially keep in mind that computers are for more than just entertainment: they are for education as well. So what are you waiting for? Discover how great an impact computers can have on your life with just a click of the mouse.
456	458	1	3	Dear editor, I understand that some children and adults love going on the computer, but they don’t know what the bad effects are. When you're at a young age, anything can happen, and while you're on the computer, even worse things can happen. You could do bad things over the internet, won't exercise, or have time for your family. First of all, what I mean by bad things is that your child can go on bad websites, talk to strangers, or get harassed. When a child first gets, for example, a Facebook account, most of the times the people who request them as a friend are unregistered child molesters and or sex offenders. They would probably act friendly to get the kid comfortable, and then they would end up kidnapping them. Also, you could harass people or get harassed yourself, and you can go on inappropriate websites. Secondly, you won't get enough exercise, and this can lead to health problems. A child who stays indoors basically misses out on physical activity, which all kids need. This lack of exercise can contribute to health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure, and childhood obesity. Lastly, your child won't have family time. Now with more technology coming out like cellphones and laptops, kids would rather hang out with their friends and not with their families. I could understand the whole cellphone thing, but you need to make more time for your family. The reason I think going on the computers all the time is not good is because you can do bad things by talking to strangers, face harassment, and go on inappropriate websites, you won't get enough exercise and can suffer from health issues, and you won't have enough family time mainly because of all the new technology that has come out. It is important to be aware of these dangers and to use technology responsibly.
457	459	1	3	"Dear editor, In my opinion computers are wonderful to society in many ways. They can keep memories we can't keep forever like photographs, documents, and type letters. Computers also can give you dieting tips and advice from live locals. But, most important of all, family that you miss can talk to you for hours without a phone bill. To begin, a computer can give you helpful tips on things you didn't know, so it can also be a learning center. For example, if you're extremely stressed out because you have a huge paper to do but have no facts, there are millions of websites you could go to find your answers on. The next day you get your paper back and there's an A stamped right across it. Another helpful thing about computers is that you can talk to your family members all the way in a different city, town, state, or even continent! You may miss them a lot, but you can always see them or type to them to let that sad feeling melt away for a little bit. Every one in two Americans says missing or not seeing a family member is like letting a little piece of your heart fall off. Everybody knows what it's like to have a memory that you could never forget, but what about those little memories that photographs, websites, and written work seem to slip away from the brain. Computers save all of that so the ""I know what it's like to lose a little part of life that you have lived,"" exclaims one user. This is exactly why computers are beneficial in many ways. I hope you are thankful for the mind, tips, and family connections they provide."
458	460	1	3	"Dear editor, Have you seen someone with a smartphone emailing their co-worker or a person with their laptop at a coffee shop? Well, I can say I have and know they need it and it benefits them. People everyday use a computer for their work. Also, you can keep in touch with friends and family. Plus, it's the start to a new improved future! Whether you use a computer to get the latest gossip or for a job, the computer is now an important part of people's lives. My mother works on the computer everyday at her job; though it may not seem important to you, it is to my family, who needs the money for food and bills. Half of the workforce uses computers for jobs for money just like my family. Recently, a major computer company took a survey to see how many people use the computer for work. A whopping amount of people use the computer for work. That large percentage of people benefit from using the computer. They depend on their email to get to their boss or their layout of their statewide meeting to save so they can get the raise they deserve. You, the newspaper, even uses computers to write your articles for the paper. More than half of businesses and organizations benefit just from working on the computers. Everyone says family is the most important thing, right? What can you do if they live far away? Well you email, video call, instant message, or call of course. Some experts claim, ""People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family."" Video calling is and was originally invented to keep in touch with family. So the experts have no reason to claim that because people use the computer to keep in touch with families. Even people in the army use the computer to communicate. Using the computer isn't as bad as people think. Look out! The future is coming! New technology greater than my knowledge is coming. Computers were the start and people haven't stopped since. Sure, of course the computer has a couple downsides, but what thing or invention doesn't. No one can stop what is coming; you just have to learn to live with it and move on. Computers are the beginning to something good so don't stop something that could be even better! Next time you go outside look for that guy in the business suit emailing on the smartphone or the girl in the coffee shop and smile, knowing they are benefitting from it, whether it's for work or for keeping in touch with a relative, or maybe someone with the next big idea for the future. Take a chance on the computer, stop the negativity, and a pleasant surprise will come your way."
459	461	1	3	Dear The Local Newspaper, I do believe computers effect people, but in many different ways. Also, depending on how long you are on the computer for. In my opinion, computers are good for many reasons. I will tell you some of the reasons why I believe this. Hopefully, after you read this you'll think about it more. One reason computers are good is the communication. There are many different web sites to go on and talk to friends and family. If you had a family member far away, this could be a good way to talk to them. This also is a way to see your friends with the latest technology; you can video chat. Video chat is a way to see and hear your friends by a little camera. It is a very good way to keep in touch with people you know. Another reason is that you can get a lot of information from the computer. There are so many websites that provide answers to all your questions. Websites like online encyclopedias and libraries recommend other sites to go research. You can learn a lot from computers. The information provided on the computer can really teach everyone something. Lastly, a computer can help you with many things, such as online classes, matchmaking, jobs, and so much more. You can find things to do by just typing it into the computer. The economy is very bad, but you can look for jobs online. Then once they find one you're interested in they'll tell you. It's a very good and helpful way for you, and it's so simple. Computers are an amazing and new technology. They keep coming up with more and more innovations. So why not use it? It can teach you something and help you, and also help you stay in touch with family and friends. Don't take it for granted, but use it well. It's only a click of a button. I hope I made you all realize what a computer is really useful for, and maybe even changed your minds or gave you a different way of thinking about computers.
460	462	1	3	Dear Editor, Technology has been advancing at a rapid rate for many years now, making life much easier for everyday people. It helps out in many ways, for example, to keep in touch with relatives, to learn new information, and to keep you safe and updated. Computers are vital to everyday life and we need them. A huge purpose of computers is to keep in touch. With new programs like social media and messaging apps, it leaves you with all sorts of new opportunities to keep in touch and have fun with your friends that were not previously available. Email as well is a great tool to keep in touch with family that are far away, opposed to the good old letter which may take a week in the mail. Another huge reason why we need computers today is to be able to research foreign places and learn facts that without a computer you would never have even heard of. With computers, it makes it possible to go online, look up a destination, research it, and plan a flight there a week later. It is also a great tool to learn new things that you did not know previously; it is a huge step up in the education process. Computers also provide us with extreme safety and security as well as breaking news. Imagine how much simpler it would be to be able to be at home and go on the computer to check the best route home, opposed to not having that information and consequently sitting in traffic. With modern day technology all that is possible. They add great safety and protection to average people like you and me. In conclusion, hopefully your mind has been changed on the topic of computers, or if you already were in support, that as well is great. Now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future. I understand that some people do not enjoy electronics, but it is up to you to set them straight! Computers are great tools for moving ahead and we should cheer for them, not trash them.
461	463	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I've heard that some people think that computers do not benefit society. But I believe they do. Computers help us learn information of all types, from simple facts to complex subjects. It's a good source of entertainment, providing a wide array of activities. And last but not least, computers do not drastically change the time we use exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Computers are a great resource in our everyday lives so why not use what we were given. Consider Google, yahoo, Facebook and the local library. What would we do without them. They help us figure out small things like a quick and easy way to get rid of a stomach ache or a funny joke to tell at the office the next day while you are in the staff room drinking coffee. They also help us when we want to know what to do when your newborn has a cough and a small sneeze, you know the tough stuff. These are the kinds of things you need to know and not everyone can go out to the library every time you have a question. The information on the computers is endless; why not use it from learning a new language for your next vacation to Paris to finding help for that geometry homework that you just can't understand, the computer can do it all. Entertainment is everlasting on computers from the skateboarding dog on Youtube that you can't stop laughing at to the exciting new games on addictinggames.com. There will never be a dull moment. There are millions of videos and movies on youtube. There are thousands of games on the website alone from pacman to scrabble; there's no way we'll have nothing to do. I always go on Skype to talk to family living too far to visit. Computers are one of the best sources of entertainment; they definitely benefit society. Computers definitely do not change the way we exercise, enjoy nature or interact with family and friends. On the computer there are videos that show us new yoga moves and other ways to lose those extra pounds you gained over the holidays. There are sites to find where to go camping and have that family vacation you have always wanted. And we always make time to go see our family and friends. Computers don't keep us hypnotized. Without a doubt, computers benefit everyone's society. They are informational. They definitely entertain us all. And they don't turn us into mindless zombies so that we can't interact with other people. Computers are one of the most helpful things we have and no one should think they aren't after reading this essay.
462	464	1	3	Dr. Smith, The effects computers have on people and why people don't agree that this benefits society and some people use it to be online to talk to friend and family. Why people don't agree to use the computer. First the computer we could use for every thing like to go to other places you want to visit virtually. Then if you want to work or go to another school sometimes you need to do it by computer. Why not try to use the computer. I know a computer is a lot of money but sometimes it is good to have it. Some people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For example, some family and friends are not in the same place and they can't see each other; they could write to each other online if they don't have a cell phone or a house phone. Then if people want to enjoy other nature that they don't know they could use the computer and look for the place. The third reason is that people could do exercising through the computer. It doesn't matter if they spend a lot of time on the computer because people could be doing a lot of things on the computer. Like students, we do a lot of projects on the computer; we search for any information or thing. So people think that the computer is fun for them. Finally, other people that don't agree they should try it. That is the effects computers have on people and why people don't agree and spend time online.
463	465	1	3	Computers, computers, computers. Who doesn't own them right? They teach hand eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about faraway places and people; can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure nonsense. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everyday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one more step. Cellphones, cars, telephones—you want it! They're all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that ninety percent of cars have computers built in them? By the press of a button, all doors unlocked, by a switch the windows go down, yes, by computer. Now, how do computer's make life easier you say? Well keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats, the pencils you use are all made by, the you know what! Machines, but programmed with computer chips. Oh I remember when my history teacher told me that it took eight hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like thirty minutes with the help of computers. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are an everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other on long distance calls, right? Well then chat online on your own personal laptop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With the everyday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact. We use them everyday, and hopefully they'll be around for the longest time.
464	466	1	3	Computers have a good effect on people because they can teach people hand eye coordination, events in history and about other cultures and they are a great way to relax and just have fun. Computers teach hand eye coordination by training your hand to go where your brain tells it to and where your eyes show it. Hand eye coordination is very important. It can help people drive; it decreases reaction time and it can help people write more neatly. If it can help a driver turn his wheel faster or hit his brake I think that hand eye coordination could help that driver stay out of an accident. Think of a climber trying to grab a hold on a mountain. He would be able to see it, grab it, and pull himself up quicker than before. Most people don't know things like how many soldiers were on the Normandy beaches or how many countries there are in the world. The internet is a great place to find out about history, world events, and other things you want to know. A lot of americans don't know their own state's history alone, let alone world history. You can google anything you want from when the American Civil War ended to when the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989. You can also learn either interesting and useful things like food recipes or the contents in paints. Or you could just be keeping up with the news on yahoo.com. Computers are a lot of fun. You can talk with friends, listen to music, play games or do all three at the same time. That's just scratching the surface. Did you miss your favorite show last night? There are hundreds of websites that will let you watch it for free. Did you want to hear your favorite bands new album? You can listen to it legally and free on youtube.com, playlist.com and many more websites. Between learning about other cultures and just having fun, the computer can be a great tool for interacting with friends and family, improving hand eye coordination, or learning something new.
465	467	1	3	Dear Editor, Computers have many positive effects on society these days. I believe this because computers provide us with communication skills. They provide you with information and they increase your skill when it comes to technology. Read on to hear how I further explain my reasoning. First off, computers provide you with communication skills. I know that I am always finding the computer useful. It allows you access to websites that help you talk to new and old friends. It is a fast and easy way to communicate with someone. Whether you're at your house, or on the go with your laptop, you can talk to people all over the world. Secondly, computers supply you with information to write papers, newspaper articles, etc. When a teacher asks the class to write a paper about a specific topic, students can simply just go home and type the topic in on a search engine. At that point they're automatically supplied with thousands and thousands of different sources of information. I know that seventy percent of the population of the United States prefer computer sources over book sources because computers are so much easier when it comes to finding specific information. Lastly, computers increase your skills when it comes to technology. Although some computers can be fairly easy to use, companies are constantly trying to increase the complexity of computers. They are also always coming out with new software for your computer. By making computers and software more high tech, people in the generation now are more technically advanced than many other countries. As a whole, computers have a huge impact on our country's technical skills. I believe computers have a positive effect on society. I think this because computers provide us with communication skills, they provide you with information, and they increase your skill when it comes to technology. I hope I have made it so that we are looking at this from the same angle.
466	468	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've heard reports from both the news on @CAPS2.V. and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers. I'm not saying it's a bad thing I mean the computer has the internet which allows you to go to anything like websites and online chatting, which can be very engaging. I just think that people should get outside more often and do some outdoor things like football, basketball, baseball or if you're an adult you could get a job that doesn'@CAPS2 require a computer like for example building houses for homless people, shelters for animals, or have a job as a maitnence man, pool lifeguard, or any other job at a hotel that doesn'@CAPS2 involve a computer. You could work at a restaurant that has regular food or fast food service. Something that does'ent involve a computer and gets you moving. But if you can'@CAPS2 get out of the house you could do something a little different from computers video games. They maybe similar to the computer but they are something you can do on the @CAPS2.v. and it beats playing on the computer all the time, offering a different kind of entertainment. It is important to find a healthy balance in our daily activities.
467	469	1	3	"Computers are progressing into our lives more and more. These machines help our world become an easier place to do work, pay bills and even entertain ourselfs. @CAPS3, these things are weighed down by the negative effects like the online dangers, increasing detachment from reality, and the obesity problems we face. With our new advances people are spending more time sitting around than being outside, which udds more and more to obesity problem we face. Kids and teens today would much rather be on their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 account, than go for a run or shoot some hopps. Also, more and more ads are on the web for unhealthy foods making these kids more likely to eat more junkfood. Finally, the internet fools people into believing they can go on easy diet and become skinny with no worries. Along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats. Viruses can hack you computer, steal you personal info and destroy you computer. You can have huge bills for things you didn't even buy! Cyber bullies are also a new and dangerous threat!. These people threaten and taught inosent people. I remember a story of a girl who took her own life because she was bullied by someone who turned out to be another girl and her mother. Finally, online predators are a great threat to teens. These people brain wash people, convince them to meet, and rape and kill them. Last but not least todays computers interaction with young minds increases ignorance with ads, and negleck of education and reading. Many kids even myself would rather be online than read a book or do homework. @CAPS3, computer can take over some people's likes, they will neglect school and other important things like homework or studing credting weaker minds for out future. Also, ads and website with false information can fall down our youth even more with ignorance and ignorant belifs. Finally, kids computer interaction can cause belites like ""you shout vote for @PERSON1 because he is black"" or other racist and ignorant statements. Computers help our advance in bettering the world and our understanding of our world, @CAPS3, certain aspects can create ignorance and danger for people yound and old, and their minds, which is a serious concern for our society's future."
468	470	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, This leter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computers use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you modre about it... As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors.""Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least @NUM1 minutes everyday,"" @PERSON2. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn'@CAPS1 healthy being in the house all day. A second reason @CAPS1 worry shout over- usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday. ""People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy,"" ssays health expert @PERSON1,"" however @PERCENT1 of people don'@CAPS1 because of computers."" this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for @NUM2 minutes, but the @NUM2 minutes turns into @NUM4 minutes, which @MONTH1 even turn into an hour! I know still @MONTH1 be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, @CAPS2 I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don'@CAPS1 like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. How of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. But it's not the same as spending quality time together in person. ""Friends come and go and you and your family won'@CAPS1 live forever,"" says therapist @PERSON3"", @CAPS2 motor the best of that you have."" there won'@CAPS1 be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen. As you can see there reasons why I am concerned about people spending time on the computer. There's less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into concideration and encourage a more balanced lifestyle."
469	471	1	3	I believe that computers benefit society. They make life easier. Computers allow now of communication between friends. They also teach you new things. Computers make our lives easier. They let us look things up by easier means than a person or book. It has made it simpler to type reports. Now you don't have to worry about making mistakes on a typewriters and having to type it again. A computer saves the report and shows you some mistakes to take case of your children. It allows you to work from your home. Computers allow new means of communication. You can talk online with friends. Social networks such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 allow that. Computers allow you to converse with friends you don't normally get to see or talk to. They also make it easier and more fun to make new friends. Computers teach us new things. They teach you about places you haven't seen before. Any question you can be asked on the internet and you will get an answer. It gives you answer you don't know who to ask for. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. You can play games online or with @CAPS3's. You need to have good hand-eye coordination in order to play these games well. Computers have a positive effect on people of all ages. They make our lives easier with their technology. They allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks. Computers also teach us new things such as hand-eye coordination. All these reasons and more are why I believe that computers benefit our society and are a valuable tool for everyone.
470	472	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers are a necesity for social interaction, homework, research, and are a great source of entertainment on a rainy day. After a long day at school @CAPS1 teens go from the bus, to the front door, to their computer chair. In fact, @PERCENT1 of must teens do so. Odds are they're logging into facebook, myspace, formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other socially interactive websites. With good time management I actually find these websites important. I think facebook and e-mail and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ( @CAPS5) are a great way to be socially interactive. It's also a great way to keep in touch with long distance family or friends. I go to @DATE1 camp and have made friends I call my family. Some of them being across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Seeing as how I can't make long distance calls which would cost way too much money, facebook is a geat alternative to keep in touch. @CAPS1 of my family also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle and cousin in @LOCATION1. My aunt just had a baby, meaning I have a new cousin which I'm not able to see in person yet so seeing pictures on facebook instead of spending money on envolopes, stamps and picture prints is really awesome @CAPS1 homework given out in school requires a computer. Three out of five homework assignments are on the computer. Whether it be taking a twenty question test to defining a word the computer is a schoolwork necesity. In school now many projects are assigned meaning we need the computer and internet. We use powerpoint and other microsoft documents whether it be typing an essay or creating a powerpoint slideshow. We need the internet for research to get the information we need, to suceed. Aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing the computer holds many more wonders. Many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer. While this @MONTH1 be true for some people it is not true for @CAPS1. Many people are concerned children are becoming lazy but in a recent vote @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers said they'd radther see their children playing and interacting on the computer then being a couch patato and watching @CAPS6. On a rainy day the computer can be a great alternative. You can slide in a @CAPS7 and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 have at least two computers in the house for a reason. They're important to @CAPS1 people everyday lives. The computer is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends. You also need to computer for school almost all the time and on a rainy day its a great alternative then being lazy a watching @CAPS6 while your eyes fall asleep. I do believe computers have a positive effect on people and are essential in the modern world.
471	473	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think it has both good and bad aspects. The good is it teaches people about @CAPS1 places and how other people live in their society, what they do to get food or how they raise their kids. It also helps people like cops because they have a person there they are looking for; they have the computer to look up information. It also helps cops as in the case of a speeder; they can see if he or she has done it before. It helps teachers to get a lesson plan or go online to teach, or they will put you on a program to help you with your typing. Yes, it does have a positive effect on some people. Some people think they do a lot better work around the computer or they do their best work online, like for a high school paper. Yes, you can talk to other people online and get @CAPS1 friends. On the other hand, computers can be bad as in you meet people online and you don't know who that person is or where they come from. They might have a long criminal record. They might be someone who wants to get you in trouble because of his or her family problems. Some people spend too much time on the computer because they meet someone they really like and don't worry about what the family wants to do. Some people used to work out every day, but now they can talk to their friend all night and all day; they stop exercising and forget about it and never start again. Some people just stay in the house and stay on the computer instead of playing baseball or football or going to family reunions. Therefore, while computers offer significant benefits, it is crucial to be aware of their potential downsides and use them responsibly.
472	474	1	3	Do you like going on the computer? Well after you read this, I don't think you would want to as much. I know that the population of @ORGANIZATION1 uses the computer. If you're on the computer for @NUM1 hour, you can damage your eyes and you would have to wear glasses, and you don't want that; sometimes it's hard to stay off of them. The internet can be used for a lot of things, like to talk to your friends and family and to play games. The computer is for learning about different things; one thing you can learn is the presidents, another thing is your family history. Now you know what the computer can do to you. You should only use the computer for @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes at a time. That is what I would do to protect your health and well-being.
473	475	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, as @CAPS1 technology continues to become more and more enhanced, so has the percentage of Americans who use computers. @PERCENT1 of those Americans are children from the ages of @NUM1 to @NUM2. Most teens use the computer to interact with friends on social sites or spend a good chunk of their time at home playing online games. But what about the other teens; the ones who are constantly facing cyber bullying or are put in danger's way by talking to people they don't even know? To prevent these issues, I say we put a limit on our use of technology. Social sites, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and Facebook, have been growing at an alarming rate. More teens would rather be on the computer than outside playing tag or on a swingset. I, myself, have an @CAPS2, Facebook, and @CAPS3 and it's prevented me from getting exercise because it's almost like I'd rather be talking to my friends than going for a jog. It bothers me, it really does, but there is one question I always ask myself; how do I stop? I've been going on runs, studying more, and spending time with my family. There are ways and reasons to stop being so attached to technology, we just don't know how to get the message spread. Other than the effects social sites and lack of exercise has had because of computers, online gaming is also a big issue too. Many kids, not mostly boys, from what I see at school are absolutely loving online gaming. But the only people that actually benefit in life are the website owners. These games are not educational; it's not a good way to spend a couple of hours of your time, so generally it's a waste. More important things should be done during this time like studying or doing homework. Just think, you could even hang out with friends during that time rather than staring at a monitor. Although computer gaming is a big reason why kids go on the computer, bullying is a huge factor along with stranger danger on chats. If you're someone who's bullied constantly at school, you think being able to go home and spend time on the computer is amazing; until bullying came along. Cyber bullying can lead to a child hurting themselves, getting into fights at school or even worse, someone's life taken because they didn't think it was worth living. Limited computer use or parental control would really help prevent this. Computer usage has its ups and downs, but my point is safety, health, and education are some of the main issues we face because of modern technology. I'd like to hear that my letter to your newspaper was read. Please get back to me with your thoughts on this issue within the next three days by email.
474	476	1	3	I think the computer has a positive effect on people all over the world. You can do lots of things on the computer like academic work, talk on the internet, or even find out facts about famous people you love. I think computers can benefit society because computers can help you with your academic work, and can also allow you to talk to your friends online. One way I can benefit from using the computer is by typing my school work. But when I'm not doing my school work, I enjoy talking to my friends online. But the best thing of all is finding out information about famous people like @PERSON1. I remember when I was doing a project on the computer and got a @NUM1 on it because I used the computer. That should prove that computers are very helpful. Have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your everyday life? If you said no, I can tell you how. You can learn about different places and food. Let's say I was going to make pizza and I did not know how; I would have to look on the computer for how to do it. A professor from a Virginia or New York tech school said that without computers the world is nothing. @PERCENT1 of people at the New York tech school agreed but @PERCENT2 did not; could you imagine a world without computers? If the world did not have computers we would not have cell phones or even TV. Not everyone knows this, but cell phones are computers; let's face it, without computers the world would be lost like the professor from the New York tech school said. Also, teenagers would be bored because most teenagers do not like to go outside and if we do not have computers how will adults do their work? They will have to handwrite it. Let's be honest, some adults and kids' handwriting is like chicken scratch, so to say. I think computers are very helpful for everyone around the world. In closing, I think the whole world should keep computers because without them the world is lost, forced back to the past with paper.
475	477	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my @CAPS1 opinion is that computer use is getting out of hand. There are people who are getting addicted to @CAPS2, such as games, websites, communication and email websites and etc. Therefore, there are people who are just plain addicted to the computer, such as to @CAPS3. I know people who are addicted to @CAPS3 because they get addicted to talking to people, and looking at other people's profiles. So they don't cooperate correctly with their school work, so they get bad grades, or they lose connection with family members and friends, so they become lonely and depressed. Then their only friend is the computer. Also, other effects of the computer are that if you're addicted to a website in general, you can get out of shape because you're not spending enough time exercising; there are already enough people in @LOCATION1 that are obese and computer addiction is already an add-on to the problem. I read online that a high number of people in @LOCATION1 are obese. So computers are an addiction waiting to happen. Therefore, people need to start spending time with friends and start exercising and stay away from the computer to maintain a healthy and balanced life.
476	478	1	3	"Computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things. Many of us in @LOCATION1 spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday. Being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you. In @DATE1 too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than doing other activities. Therefore, computers are not the best way to spend your time because you get less exercise, your school grades can lower, and your communication skills will weaken. First, when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends. In @LOCATION1 during @DATE1, many more people are becoming obese, creating unhealthy genes to be passed on. Perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, see movies, and even to get a college education. Less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers there would be more free time for people to get outside, or play sports, leading to a healthier lifestyle. Secondly, many kids and teens are attached to their laptop, and bring it everywhere with them. So, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Many must choose to go on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 rather than opening their books. Plus, spending so many hours on a computer leaves less time to do their homework, so they just begin to not do any of it. Computers take away their time that could be used towards getting a college education, why waste them on trivial online activities? Lastly, why talk on the phone or in person when you can just send them an e-mail or chat online with them? Many people @DATE1 are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face to face. This can cause a lack of communication skills, something that might sound good online, could sound absolutely terrible in the ""real"" world. This loss of skill, could lead to a generation of more cyber talk rather than @CAPS3, which is essential for personal and professional success. In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside, or hanging out with friends? Personally I'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer."
477	479	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are beneficial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous, but they also offer significant benefits. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about too much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be beneficial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc., providing immediate answers. Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends and family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspace which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantly talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exercise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends and family, plus there's time limits. In this day and age, the computer is something we can't live without.
478	480	1	3	Do you really think computers have a positive effect? Don't you think way too many people are on their computer too long? You want me to write to my local newspaper about what I think on the effects they give people. I think they have a horrible effect on people. @CAPS2 people are on the computer doing something; it can give them headaches, eye strain, but if they were outside they would be exercising. One of the reasons I think computers have a bad effect on people is addictions. There are many things people @MONTH1 get addicted to like facebook, myspace, formspring. Another example, @CAPS2 my sister gets home first thing she does is go on facebook, formspring and youtube. My second reason why I think computers have terrible effect is because of eye damage. @CAPS2 you're staring at a computer screen for so long you don't notice but your eyes are getting damaged. @CAPS2 I was in sixth grade I needed glasses because I was addicted to computer for so long and my eyes got damaged. My third reason @CAPS1 I think computers have terrible effect on people is because it's a waste of time. @CAPS2 you're at home on the computer and it's sunny out; you should be outside with friends, family, or even just taking a walk, and it's also a waste of time because @CAPS2 you're on computer you could also be doing something productive instead. You might think they have positive effect yes, but they damage your body. These are the reasons @CAPS1 I think computers have a bad effect on people. Instead of being on the computer join a sports club. Now is the time to take action by making more clubs or activities for people. The issue is people waste too much time on computer. These are my reasons @CAPS1 computers have terrible effect on people.
479	481	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8? Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it necessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at to go industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculating or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example @MONTH1 need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead @ORGANIZATION1 a book with a few authors."" @CAPS7 day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest @ORGANIZATION1 his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got a half @ORGANIZATION1 a page @ORGANIZATION1 notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the @ORGANIZATION2 computer and got three pages @ORGANIZATION1 notes. ""I was so relieved to log on to the internet"", @PERSON1 reported to me. A survey was set up by the @CAPS8 foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and @PERCENT3 said yes. Do you want students @ORGANIZATION1 all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine @ORGANIZATION1 modern day technology. Computers are a magnificent part @ORGANIZATION1 society. @MONTH1 I remind you that computers benefit many jobs in @LOCATION1 and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know. I sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter. What is your vision on computers today?"
480	482	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, @CAPS2 has been brought up to concern that computers are a menace to society. On the contrary, computers are very helpful. If one needed directions to a place or if one wanted to know how to do something @CAPS2 would show how to. They also can help you do things like read faster and improve hand eye coordination. Computers are also a good form of entertainment. Those are some of the reasons computers are helpful. First, computers can help find out how to do things. If there is somewhere far to go or there are many winding roads to get there you can use the computer. On the computer there are many maps that give detailed descriptions on how to get places. Specialist say that over @PERCENT1 viewers get to their destination safely due to these tools, reducing issues due to lack of driving skills. Computers also help with instructions on how to make things. If there is a cake to be made the computer will have recipes to make @CAPS2. That also can help make projects. For example They show things about @CAPS3 mythology for making a @CAPS3 project. The computer can help you learn languages. There is software that can teach people languages just like books except that they have animated teachers to help speak the language that one got directions to go to. Reading all the different languages can help you with normal reading. Another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 americans have trouble reading. That wouldn't happen if they had computers. Almost everything on the computer has to be read so @CAPS2 gives a lot of practice. @CAPS2 also will improve hand eye coordination. When someone plays a game they watch the screen not their hand. Also on microsoft word to type an essay you watch the screen not your fingers typing. There are many games on the computer for improving hand eye coordination. The last reason that computers affect people is that they are entertaining. On the internet there are many fun games for all ages. Some games they could watch videos on youtube; there are many funny videos there. As you can see computers are helpful in many ways. They will give directions to places or help people with reading, and computers are entertaining and fun.
481	483	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, The effects computers have on society is a mixture of positive use and negative use. Getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer. When you are on the computer for more than @NUM1 minutes you start to get lazy and not wanting to get up. That affects a lot of people @DATE1 because there are a lot of people working on their computer for their jobs and they have to use the computer. Kids are harder because they don't want to do something other than just sitting on the computer instead of when they come back from school because they are so tired, if we limit the time they use the computer it will be better for kids, grown ups, and your brain. When adults spend a lot of time on the computer due to their jobs or checking their email, a lot of times they don't interact with their family or other people because they are on the computer. I can connect with this because @CAPS4 dad is always on the computer due to his office not talking to us or even seeing us. Sometimes I wish that the world should of never invented computers because I get so frustrated with them, but a lot of times we do spend family time and its good to get away from your computers besides that's what makes the money. Emailing, chatting, @CAPS3, aim, @CAPS2 are all technology communication. Using these communications is helpful if somebody can't text or doesn't have a phone you can always chat them on @CAPS3 or send them an email. Email & @CAPS3 are the only @NUM2 communications I @CAPS4 dad sends; he uses a lot of emails to @CAPS4 soccer coach about how I am not going to be at a game or I am going to a game, and he always responds. It is very easy. @CAPS3 is a good way for kids to talk to one another because some might not have phones or you don't see them at all during the school day. It's a good way to communicate without @CAPS3 or email I don't know what would happen, but I know it would be bad. So you see how computers have positives or negatives: getting lazy, not spending enough time with friends or family and talking to friends are all positive & negative conflicts of the computer.
482	484	1	3	Although most people would say the invention of a computer is a good thing, I disagree. There are many bad things about the invention of computers; they give access to the internet. The internet has inappropriate pictures and writing, unclear identification, and games. The worst of all is that on the internet, there is always unclear identification. Although something on a social website such as @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 might say a person is fourteen years old, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 might be someone that had just been released from prison and is actually forty years old. There is never a way to know if it's safe to talk to other people on the internet. Games on the internet are also very bad. Games are one of the causes of obesity in America. Also, games on the internet cause kids to be drawn away from their families. Another reason of why games are bad is because you can become addicted to them, and stare at a computer screen so long you get eye-strain. There are also inappropriate pictures and writing on the internet. There is bomb making websites and illegal music downloading websites. Overall, computers are for researching but aren't reliable in safety and cause obesity and family arguments.
483	485	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers have a negative affect on people. Computers have caused problems where kids do not do any types of physical activity which deprives them of their daily needed exercise. Also, children spend so much time on the computer, they don't get a chance to enjoy the outdoors. Another effect computers have on kids is that @CAPS6 stops them from spending time with family and friends. I don't know how people can sit on a computer all day without moving around. First, kids don't get enough exercise because they spend too much time on a computer. We know almost everybody has a computer even I do, but @CAPS6 doesn't mean @CAPS6 has to be used @NUM1. I am an athlete and I enjoy being on the computer, but I don't use @CAPS6 every second I can. Doctors always recommend everyone to get at least an hour of exercise everyday. Most people don't do that. They would be the kind of people who uses the computer or a different electronic a lot. That is also causing childhood obesity. If all you do is sit on the computer all day, you're going to be someday. But people need to get off the computer and do something like a sport or even a game. If you don't exercise you won't enjoy the outdoors. Second, people are not enjoying the outdoors. If somebody likes to play sports they shouldn't do it on @CAPS4 for three hours; instead they invite a couple of friends to play some basketball. Even walking home from school with a friend is a good way to be outside. People @MONTH1 think during the winter there is nothing to do. Have a snowball fight with some friends and enjoy yourselves. Nobody should feel embarrassed even if you wanted to play tag with a friend but you're @NUM2. Just get outside and do something. There are millions of things to do that isn't going on a computer. You're a kid so long that you have to enjoy yourselves now before you're serious with your life. Lastly when you're not outside you're not enjoying yourself with your friends or family. People are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family. You're not hanging out with your friend if you are chatting on @CAPS4. Is @CAPS6 so hard to tell them online ""@CAPS5 @NUM3 come @NUM3 my house."" @CAPS6 takes two seconds. Then in no time you will be hanging out with your friend. I don't understand why is @CAPS6 so embarrassing to be with your family. My dad and I like to go and play basketball or ping pong with each other. We don't care because we have fun. Find something your parents like to do and see if you like @CAPS6. @CAPS6 isn't hard to say to a friend or parent, ""@CAPS5 to do something."""
484	486	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much do computers affect our life? I have always thought of that question. Technology is getting up to the roof and it makes our life more easier, but have you ever thought that maybe technology might take people's work? In everyday of our live we see something new that comes out and becomes an easy tool for us. But what about us? Since technology come out people has become not the same; for example cars, by having them people doesn't walk and not even exercise, they don't spend too much time with their family and friends and lastly people miss thousands of wonderful things that happened outside. I just think that technology like computers take a whole quarter of our life by mostly doing the work for us. First, have you ever, notice that people get obese so fast? I know the answer to that question. The obesity in @LOCATION1 is getting worst, people are getting fattier by just been in a couch and sitting with a computer and eating, what exercise are they doing there? People doesn't exercise anymore, instead of them playing games like, soccer, volley-ball, baseball or even running, @CAPS3!! They are at the computer playing games that doesn't do anything good. I have asked people about what they think about this and this is what a woman answer, "" I think that people doesn't think about their health, they just think to make life easier"". I agree with her; obesity could bring you to the hospital and you don't want that. Second, have you ever asked your self about @CAPS2 much time you ever spend with friends and family? Well think of that. Maybe you got a computer because you were spending too much time outside but not with your family, but you can see that you're probably most of the time at home since you bought your computer, but not with your family. Spending time with your family is so important because you might miss so many wonderful things. For example family parties, or just watching a show on the t.v. I just think that spending time with your family is important. Lastly, if you are a parent and you are too much in a computer, won't you feel bad if something happened with your son/daughter? In everyway we always miss wonderful things, and sometimes we loose it because of technology, you don't want that right? Imagine you are at the computer and your daughter said her first word won't you feel bad if you missed that? I would. Always give time to life because maybe one day you might hate your self for missing so many wonderful things. In conclusion, so many people have become addicted to computers, they just can't leave it alone. Imagine that you become one of them. You becoming obese, not spending time with family and missing wonderful things that the world provides us. I hope you understand that technology is not everything in life."
485	487	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I think some people are overreacting, its not really going to kill you. I'm not suggesting that people should stay on the computer all day. My last reason would be that nowadays everyone knows computers. Keep reading to find out about my three topics: first off way too many people are overreacting, I think so because people say ""you are going to miss out or you are missing out on life."" Also you are still interacting with your family and friends, just not verbally (only typing). I don't know why people are so against computers, its like global warming, so many warnings and noone listens, so why will they listen to people saying that staying on a computer too long can make you fat. That was just my opinion/thoughts on that topic. Next off I am going to tell you about how a computer can't really kill you. It can't kill you because it is only a computer for one and another reason is that you can get obese and bored because I can't stay on the computer for more than an hour because it just gives me a headache. Well that was another opinion of mine so read on to see what else I got. Now I am going to tell you how everyone has computers. The thing is computers are not the only things that cause obesity. Every one has a computer now because I guess everyone goes on facebook, even my mom has a facebook! But there's also other websites like sexual, games and friend sites. The most used website I think is facebook. I think so because sooo many people have it. Well this concludes my essay and now you know my opinions on how some people overreact, how its not really going to kill you and last how everyone has a computer."
486	488	1	3	Computers have little to no negative effect on people. In fact computers help us out a lot. They help us in finding information for education, medical, research and to tell weather or not you have cancer. The computers that people often think of are machines that sit in a room and is used often but not for its primary purpose. People use it sometimes for entertainment not research. There aren't just those kind of computers. There are bigger more advanced computers that scientist use every day for complex calculations. Therefore computers do have an effect on us, but in a good way. Most of the time those people playing games or music are kids who are bored. They use it a little too often. I only play with it on rainy days when I can't go outside and play. Humans use computers mainly because it makes life simpler, easier. Indeed, it does make life simpler, like for example instead of handwriting a report, you can type it or instead of searching everywhere in a book, you can go straight to the information. One last example is; when you want to stay updated on your favorite sport team, you don't have to go to their game you just have to go to their web site. In my opinion I say that overall, computers do have an effect on us but for a good reason. I'm a sports fan so I play a lot of sports. I use the computer often for fun and research. It doesn't have a negative effect on me. It doesn't effect my lifestyle at all because I still exercise and play with my friends very often, like everyday. There is no reason to why people can't use computers quite often. Computers don't have a positive effect sometime, but it doesn't have a negative effect sometime either. I exercise, enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too. I also use the computer often. Experts shouldn't be concerned with people using computers too much as long as a healthy balance is maintained.
487	489	1	3	Dear The Editor, I can see both sides of your argument, on whether computers are important. However, computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives. Just for a moment, think what would the world be like without computers. I feel the computers are an important aspect of our lives. Computers are especially important to students and teachers. For instance if a student needed to do a report on a foreign country, he could look up facts and other things on that country, then he could condense the facts into a paragraph on a word document, and if he had a question he could email his teachers. Finally he, could print out the finished report. All that, without having to get up and bother his parents to go to the bookstore and pay a high price on a book that he will probably read one time. Also if he had a question there would be no communication outside of school. Another example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spares them of lugging heavy textbooks home. Because I know computers have helped me in school and made more work much easier. Secondly, a large percentage of businesses say that they use computer daily, and some agree that without computer, their businesses would fail. Computer make business much easier, especially with the business managing and file keeping programs that are available. On a computer, businesses can store customer information, compare income, and keep stock of inventory without having a cluttered pile or file cabinet. Computers can also save businesses money because they can cut out jobs such as record keeper. Also businesses can save time by having meeting via web cams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting then do it next month and the month after; and they could email important things such as sales projections and other things as well. Computers are also important and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from the home they can order pizza online and they can go shopping online. Also, people can pay their bills online which saves paper. Lets say this, a mother, has a child who is sick and she wants to know how to heal him, what to feed him, and what medicine to give him. She can look all this up on the computer and bookmark the websites for next time. Then her other child comes inside, and she wants to find a healthy snack. She can feed him which she can do online. Next she wants to make chicken fried rice, but she doesn't know how, she can look up the recipe online. Finally after dinner she need to clean a stain on the carpet but it wont come out so she buys a carpet cleaner from the web. Computers have just made a mother's day so much easier. Without computers our lives would be much harder. If we didn't have computers the person who did a report on that country would have failed, the sick child would have not been helped, the hungry child would have been fed unhealthy food, and many businesses would fail. Computers are an important facet of our lives and their benefits are undeniable.
488	490	1	3	Dear Editor, do you know someone who lives faraway from you? Or have you ever used an online service? These are only a few of the techniques a computer has. Computers benefitted society greatly. It helps people in many ways such as allow people to talk to each other, gain skills from playing games, and it has images and it is easier. As I mentioned, computers allow us to communicate with other people. This way, we don't have to talk to people in person all the time. it would get annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone one of three things would happen without computers. those would be either getting in trouble at school, memorizing a phone number and then dialing it, or talking to them in person. Clearly, computers make it easier to talk to people. Next, computers allow us to talk to faraway friends or family. You could write an e-mail or talk to them in a chat. This helped me because I talk to one of my friends in another state and just recently sent an e-mail to my aunt. Without a doubt, computers make it easier for us to communicate with other people, no matter how far. Secondly, every computer that I have seen is able to play some sort of game, whether it be by a disk or on a website. These games can teach us many skills. The first skill we could learn is typing. just a few days ago, I was playing a game where you had sixty seconds to type as many words as you can, as fast as you can. If you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time. It also gets harder as you go, getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on. Also, a class that at my school, information processing, is about computer. Once we were finished with our assignments, we could play type to learn games. That is also a typing game. As you can see, some games can teach us how to type. Another type of games where you need quick-thinking to be able to win. This teaches us to be ready for almost anything. Also, it teaches us to process what is around you and decide in a decision. In real-life situations you sometimes only have a few seconds to react. Games such as these help in real-life situations. The last type of game is the tower defense. This shows us teenagers to think like our lives depended on it. If we were to ever join the army and become some sort of captain, we would be able to organize our troops in the best manner we could think of these tower defense games also teach us think and plan ahead. In these types of games, it costs money to buy upgrades and buy new towers. One decision is to either buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one in a little bit. Tower defense games make us make better decisions. Games can be fun, but they teach us skills too. Lastly, computer make things easier and have images on websites. One thing that a computer makes easier is finding information quickly, which is a great benefit for everyone.
489	491	1	3	Dear Editor, Who wouldn't agree that more and more people are using computers. The issue is whether this is bad or good for you. My opinion on this matter is that I agree that computer are bad and people are spending too much time on computer. Also I agree with that because people are spending more time on computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend, And thats my opinion on why people spending to much time on computers. Clearly you can see that people spending too much time on computer and less time exercising. I say because i remember a time when my cousin used to spend most of his time on computers and not for school either he would stay on for almost the whole day he would bring food up stairs and throw the plates on floor just keep eating and eating and go to sleep without doing any thing. He would do this day after day. when I go over his house it would be dirty after all those times my family tried to tell him to clean up he didnt after he ate I asked him if he wanted to go for a walk to burn off some of the calories he would say no I can walk on the computer, Then one day he became really overweight and the doctor said you are obese but do you think he cared no but we would try to push him every day to exercise now he has diabetes. We told and him told him spending to much time on computers is bad for you. Another reason why spending too much time on computer is bad because you need to learn how to enjoy nature and get out side. I remember a time when my friend would stay in his house for days on a computer when I would ask him to come out side he would say no all time, Then one day he had to come out side to get a new computer software and when he opened door he got scared of the light and run in side This reason why spending to much time computers is bad for you this prove that you need to get out and play and get active for a healthier life.
490	492	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I heard what you were saying about if computers are a good or bad thing. I personally think that computers are a bad thing. Three reason for this are, kids don't get any exercise people are doing inappropriate things on them, and they could lead to giving out too much info, which could lead to injury or death. The first reason is that for the amount of time that someone uses a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather well, if it is a nice day of course! I mean you have to agree with me on this one, the main reasons why people are becoming obese is because of some kind of technology like computers. The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing inappropriate thing on them. If people are doing such inappropriate things on them why don't the makers of the computers block them? I don't know, I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even? From what I have learned in computer class, they can be used for more inappropriate things than I ever even knew of! The third and final reason why computer technology could be a bad thing is because some people have given too much info away on them and have gotten injured by internet predators The online world may look like fun and games until someone gets hurts, well thats what my mom says! In conclusion, as you can probably see I am really not a fan of the computer. The reasons why I don't like it are kids don't get enough exercise, kids are doing inappropriate things on it, and it has been used for injury and sometimes death. These are the reasons why the computers is a bad thing, so remember these tips, take this article into consideration before you spend too much time online.
491	493	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers benefit society because they provide a faster and easier way to do things such as communication. Email helps you communicate with other people when you don't have time to talk on the phone at work or don't want to spend an hour on the phone. It is also faster than waiting for them to answer the phone, and their phone might die. Or they won't answer and you need to get information to them fast. Another good thing about computers is looking up information; for instance, if you are going on a trip you can look up hotels, find maps and plane tickets, and see what the place will look like. Or if you have a school project that you need to finish but you don't have time to read books, you can go on the internet. If you have to look up a country, a president, an animal, or find pictures, the internet has it all. Even for building projects like plastering a wall, buying a window, or planting and building a shed, you can find directions and the supplies you will need on the internet. Computers can even help someone at work, like an architect who can use computers to make a @NUM1 sketch of a building. Even for storing data, like at the doctor's office they keep your @CAPS1 in a computer. Or the government keeps secret @CAPS1 in computers. There are still jobs like fixing computers and building computers. This is why I think computers are good for society, because without computers some people wouldn't have a job and everything would be harder and be limited to certain things like fast communication and work directions.
492	494	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, the @CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers. I have learned over the years of using them that they aren't as helpful as they seem. They can cause an addiction and create numerous distractions. First of all, many doctors say that computers cause ""the new depression."" The internet is where most of this takes place. For most teenagers, having a Facebook, Myspace, or Formspring is not unusual. I know from personal experiences that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people. So therefore, not only do you get made fun of in school, but now people can make fun of you in cyberspace. This is the main reason that people become socially depressed. There is almost no way to escape it, and all of their anxiety really starts to get to them. Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact. Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that this is how they spend their free time. About @PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted. From my @CAPS1 experience with using the internet, I know that there is always something that pulls you back in. You know that you are an addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer. Parents always say that it is a self-control issue, but many adults have the same problem. They have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase of addiction. Furthermore, this addiction problem would be totally gotten rid of if we stopped using computers. Finally, computers also create many distractions for students. When students sit down to type their papers, they also, many times, have another window open at the same time. Therefore they are getting barely any work done. Social networks only just make this even worse. Constantly chatting with someone can cause you to lose track of time. Also, when you try to multitask with the internet, it becomes difficult to focus, therefore causing grades to go down or not complete homework on time. All in all, this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers. In conclusion, computers do not help us. They cause social depression, which causes people to have anxiety problems. They cause addiction, which ends up taking over people's lives. They create diversions that make concentrating hard. I feel that computers have negative effects and they should be gotten rid of completely!"
493	495	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that every @NUM1 out of @NUM2 obese children spend @NUM3 or more hours a day on a computer? Computers @MONTH1 be fast and convenient, but why is it that our country is one of the most obese countries in the world because of this ""technology""? Computers are bad for humans because they keep people from enjoying nature, keep people from spending quality time with their families, and they give people less time to exercise. First off, people can't enjoy nature. As you know, forests are being chopped down and pollution is destroying our world. People need to see how beautiful our world is if we really want to save it. Second, being on a computer makes you stay inside. People stay inside for at least six to @NUM2 hours a day depending on your job or if you are in school. Lastly, @CAPS2, computers take away from time that should be spent with friends or family. First, people will become anti-social. When being on a computer for a long time, people will forget how to interact with others. With millions of people like that, our society will soon become chaos. @CAPS2, some people do all of their socializing online; they get obsessed and then their family @MONTH1 leave them. They will then fall into a depression. Last, computers are a waste of time, money, and effort. This shows why computers are bad. Lastly, being on a computer gives you less time to exercise and stay healthy. First of all, people will get fat. With less time to exercise, people can't burn the calories and will get obese. Then, without exercise, people's bodies will become more prone to disease and injury. Last but not least, people without healthcare won't be able to pay the medical bills and @MONTH1 become homeless. This is why computers are bad for our society."
494	496	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you like it if your children stay on the computer all the time? I wouldn't. Children or even adults won't spend time with family, kids will be unhealthy, and lastly they can get addicted to using the computer and computer language. Please keep reading to hear my ideas. To begin with, children or even adults won't spend as much time with their family. For example, @PERCENT2 of people will stay on the computer all day and won't even worry about their kids. I remember when I read on Facebook that a guy was so into a game he was playing that he didn't answer the phone when they told him his son got hit by a car. Now, newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you want your son going through what that man's son went through? I don't think so. Also, kids or adults will be unhealthy and not exercise. A study was shown and @PERCENT3 of people who use the internet don't exercise or work out. Out of that @PERCENT3, @PERCENT4 are suffering from obesity. My cousin is always on the computer and the doctor told him to minimize how much time he's on it because he's obese. He weighs @NUM1 pounds due to being on the computer all the time. So tell me, newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you want your kids to be obese? Lastly, now-a-days kids are ""obsessed"" with the computer and computer language. @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer use computer language in school. And out of that @PERCENT1, many put internet on their phone so they can go on Myspace, Facebook, etc. Now, newspaper @CAPS1, what @CAPS2 happen if you wrote computer language in your article? Wouldn't you get fired? In conclusion, I hope you took my letter into consideration. Kids or adults will be unhealthy, kids will be too obsessed with the computer, and lastly they won't spend time with family."
495	497	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are affecting the lives of many people. More and more people keep getting sucked into the amazing things that computers can do and forget all about the other more important things in life. People should be exercising, and hanging out with friends and family; computers don't even teach you that much if you really think about it. People don't even realize that computers can take away very important things in life. For instance, people aren't getting nearly as much exercise as they need. In this generation, more kids are overweight and obese than any other generation. People get so caught up in what they are doing on the computer that they forget to exercise each day, or at least every other day. Computers just add to the list of excuses not to do anything. People already spend way too much time watching T.V. It rots your brain, and studies actually show that people are less aware and less connected to the world and the people around them. Computers are the same as T.V.'s; you say that you're just going to be on for a minute and then next thing you know @NUM1 hours have already gone by. Computers @MONTH1 be exercising your brain, but they're not exercising your body and that's what really counts. Even if you were on the computer doing research for a school project, the computer still wouldn't help you. Most people don't have the time to run out to the library to get the books that they need, so they just resort to the computer. That isn't the smartest idea because half of the websites that you click on or go to don't even have the correct information. You might look at it and read it, and even if it sounds good to you, that doesn't mean that it's right. Next thing you know, you have a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 on an assignment that you thought you aced. On top of getting false information, most people don't even know where to look to get the information that they're looking for. People just type what they are looking for into the Google search box and press enter. Then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page. Then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were. People then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they don't feel like trying to get back to that page. If people just went to the library and did research the old fashioned way, then they would stop to notice all the things in life that they are missing out on. People should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer. Sure you can talk to people on the computer but you can't bond with them or really see what they are feeling. It's better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change. Even if you're spending time with your family or friends you're probably thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there, so go out and do something for a change; a little fresh air wouldn't kill you. You should go to an amusement park, ride some rides with your cousins, do something that will keep your mind off the computer. People don't realize it, but after spending so much time with your family, rather than your computer, you will actually notice what you have been missing out on for so long. As you can see, computers aren't helping anyone. It's either not exercising, getting false information, or not spending time with your own family! Seems to me that having computers around isn't everything that it's cracked up to be.
496	498	1	3	"To whom it may concern at the local community board, it is possible to imagine a world without computers, where drivers are bumping around and having difficulty watching the wheel and the road, phone bills are through the roof because the whole world has no other way of communicating, and students are home worried sick that they do not have a book to study with. Computers positively affect all of these areas of our lives. They teach hand-eye coordination, allow us to communicate with others in dozens of ways, and let students learn and stay updated from their very own home. Computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. To begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand-eye coordination. In a recent report, the National Drivers Association states that in the past five years, the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. The video games, the computer mice, and even typing train the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, fingers, and other appendages. ""It's not only on the road where hand-eye coordination counts,"" says Dr. Evans, head of surgery at City General Hospital. ""We are finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can perform robotics surgery with much more precision than our older attendings."" Without the coordination we acquire from the computer, many jobs would be out of reach, too. When asked, nine out of ten managers of local businesses said they would hire someone who could type over someone who could not. So, though you may think computers teach nothing, they can provide coordination skills for the rest of a person's life. Secondly, computers should be part of our homes because they allow people to communicate with others across the world. In a 2010 poll, only fifteen percent of teenagers had an e-pal, but a recent poll says that over sixty percent now have e-pals. Computers have opened new ways to communicate through e-mail, instant messaging, and social networking sites, just to name a few! Parenting Monthly says that parents prefer their teens to e-mail friends or message as opposed to talking on the phone because it quiets the house, frees the phone lines for others, and keeps the phone bill low. My friend once only talked online for a month and her parents encouraged her because the phone bill decreased by a third. It is clear that even though you may feel that computers take up time that could be spent with others, it is actually a way to communicate with people everywhere. Finally, computers can help students learn. In today's schools, students depend on homework being posted online and getting their books over the web. Once, my brother did not take home his book-bag for a week and got all his assignments online. We were grateful for the strain off his back. When asked, eighty-five percent of tenth graders say they use e-books at least twice a week. The internet is also a valuable research tool. Seven out of ten high schoolers say they use a book for research less than once a month. As you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. In conclusion, computers help us with coordination, communication, and education, providing nothing but positive effects on people and on society as a whole."
497	499	1	3	A lot of people use computers in the present day. This technology allows family and friends to interact with each other, research places and ideas, and lets you type a document to look neat. On the other hand, computer technology prevents people from being active, exploring nature, and talking to family and friends in person. I want to explain to you how I feel about computers personally. I can honestly tell you that I love computers. I spend a lot of time on social media, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes do not get to see. I can even see how my cousin in another state is doing. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I do not totally understand, I can just hop on my laptop, search what I need, and bam!, I have my information. Then after that I can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out, see? Computers are bangin! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be time consuming. I can admit that I have spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend too much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves online gaming. My mom will call him down for dinner and he will be too engrossed in what he is doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he will blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on the computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself, well, how does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one side. But here is the thing. I like my laptop. I am addicted to social media, but I still play sports, I talk to my family, and I even like to take walks through the woods or on the beach. I am neutral, like Switzerland from Europe. Some scientists say computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts say they are concerned computers have a negative effect on people. Dr. James says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world. But we do not need to spend all of our time on them. I hope you understand my balanced point on this issue.
498	500	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I agree that technology has a positive effect on people. Just like other electronic devices, computers can help you with hand-eye coordination. Plus, some people like teachers want to get staff off the internet for their students to learn about people and places. Others just want to talk to other family or friend members in other towns, states, countries, or continents. Once you read this letter, you will understand my reasoning. Firstly, these technology-enhanced machines help you with hand-eye coordination. Before the computer, people had less success in writing quickly. They had to make short notes or use shorthand notation like ""w/"" for with. Nowadays people write quicker and can write full words and sentences. They never understood what they wrote until they could put it in full sentences. When you play computer games, it gives you even more hand-eye coordination. That was only the first of the reasons. Secondly, teachers use computers to get a lot of school work and find information about history and geography. Like an online school book, it can get information on just about anything. It can look up when a president was born, when the dinosaurs went extinct, or fun facts about what the government is doing now. A computer can store what you learn, too. It also has search engines that help you locate the information like Google or Wikipedia. Statistics show that more than ninety percent of people on earth use a search engine to find something on the computer. On search engines, they have websites, pictures, movies, maps, and more. That is why people use computers for research. Have you ever felt like you do not want to travel across the country just to see your relative? Well, I have a solution to your problem. Computers have all sorts of stuff to help you communicate with other people. The computer mostly uses e-mail. E-mail is like a letter, but put electronically. It also has instant messaging. This is also like a letter but faster. If you buy a special camera that connects to your computer, you can talk to them personally. You do not even have to travel to see your relatives overseas. That is the last reason why computers have positive effects on people. Most people use computers effectively. They get hand-eye coordination, they learn important facts about places and people, plus they can talk to other people. See what I mean, computers are fun and also a positive part of society."
499	501	1	3	"Dear Editor, do you agree with what I am trying to say about people using the computer more than exercise? Well first, more and more people use computers, but how does it benefit them? Secondly, they are spending too much time on their computer than exercising. Finally, they spend less and less time with their family and being active. First, more and more people use computers but how does that benefit them? Computers are just an addicting technology that makes you lazy and slow. Does using the computer help you with problems you are having with your family? No! Well I know this from experience. My mom is always on Facebook and I hate it; I figure she loves the computer more than me. Do you want your kids to think that about you? As the days pass by, her time on the computer increases and I am sitting there needing help on homework and I am thinking, ""Why won't you listen to me?"" See, I was just thinking that because honestly, I said that it is a wrap for her, but I am just trying to say this computer will not benefit anyone anyway. Second, I want to inform the readers of this paper that people are spending more time on the computer than exercising. The obesity rate has been higher than it has ever been. I believe by twenty percent! Come on, this is ridiculous! People come home from work, get fast food, go on the computer, and eat. Over time you get bigger and your appearance changes. You begin to look sloppy and nobody wants you. You look back and regret doing what you did. Finally, you spend less and less time with your family. This causes you to grow apart from your family; your kids pick up bad habits and do the opposite of what you want them to do. This tells me that the computer is just no good at all. In conclusion, I have informed you on why I dislike computers. They do not benefit you, they make you lazy, and they keep you from your kids. So, do you, the local newspaper, agree?"
500	502	1	3	Dear local newspaper, some people are starting to believe that computers are affecting people negatively, and I am also on that side because some people would stay on it all day, get addicted to it, and want to do nothing all day. The first reason why computers are affecting people is that some people would stay on it all day; some people, when they get home from school or work, go right on the computer. They would stay on from three in the afternoon to ten at night on the computer and do it the next day. Another reason why computers are affecting people is addiction because of all those friend sites and fun things to think about on the computer. The final reason is that computers make people just sit there. So those are the reasons: some stay on all day, some get addicted, and some do not want to do anything else.
501	503	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that there is nothing wrong with being on the computer. The computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new educational games to help you learn or new informative websites. Also using computer helps you talk to people you know that maybe you haven't talked to in a while and you don't know their number, allowing you to reconnect easily. I think that having a computer makes you smart because you still do other stuff besides be on the computer all day; when you are not on you are either hanging out with friends and family or you are eating or sleeping, working out or just doing something like homework. I believe using a computer is part of your healthy choices and you can learn a lot more than you really think you can, from history to science. Using a computer and learning in school basically can teach you the same thing, complementing your education. A computer can be very health for your hands because when you are constantly moving your hands it gives them more strength and can give you stronger muscles in your hands and lower arms. In conclusion, I believe that computers are health for you and don't take any time away from exercising time or time with friends, family, sports, sleep, or eating. Computers are a hundred percent health for you when used responsibly. So I think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into their schedule each day.
502	504	1	3	"Click, click, click, ""Oh no!"" Your computer froze, what are you going to do now? Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information, you can socialize, and you can improve your skills. Without a computer, you'd be hopeless in many modern tasks. Have you ever needed to do a research project, but don't have access to go to your local town library? No problem, because you have a computer at home. You could just sit down, type in a few things, and get all the information you need, and more! You can research just about anything on everything, because the computer will have it, from academic papers to how-to guides. Maybe you want to learn something new, but there aren't many books on it, well there you go, the computer is your friend. Many people assume that computers are just for entertainment, to play games and have fun on your free time. What they don't know is all the research engines like Google, Netrekker, and other online encyclopedias, all loaded with knowledgeable information. Some people sit at home and read to become smarter, right? You can do this with a computer, which would probably even be more entertaining than a boring old book from the library. Have you ever thought to yourself ""the computer is just a way for people to get away from everyone else, and just have time to yourself?"" If you thought that way, you thought wrong! There are many ways to socialize with others through the computer such as e-mail, instant messaging, video chatting, etc. There are various ways to communicate with people through the computer. It is amazing technology because even if someone is in a different country, you can communicate with them in the click of a button. Ever heard of social networking? The name is self-explanatory. You socialize with people all across the world through a network. For example, there is Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. That is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away, friends, friends of friends, etc. You can even be really social and meet new people, as long as you're safe. You might be thinking at this point, that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing. Again, you thought wrong. Computers are a good way to help with your skills. For example, your hand-eye coordination improves. You look at the screen, type your words, look at the screen again, while clicking your mouse. That really improves your coordination. Also, your hand movement will get better. When you type, your fingers are moving all around the keyboard, creating hand muscles. Not just physical skills, but computers help with research skills. There are certain ways to research information effectively, learning to discern good sources from bad. This can help for future researching, and school purposes. Without all this, wouldn't a person be missing something? Computers play a big part in everyone's lives, no matter what age they are. Computers definitely have a positive effect on people."
503	505	1	3	"Do you have a computer? I'll bet most of you do! You might spend several hours on the computer or even more hours! Computers in fact have many down-sides to them. You could be so involved that you never go outside or get exercise. Also, sitting a few inches from the computer screen does not help your eyes. Lastly, the internet has very inappropriate websites that kids should not be seeing. Are you a kid who spends two to several hours at a time on the computer? Well, if you are, it's time to get off the spinning computer chair and out for some fresh air. Most kids spend most of their time on the computer playing games or on social media or watching videos. It might be good for kids to interact with kids out of school but some kids take it way too far. They never go outside and get any exercise. This is not good for a growing teen. They need to be up and active, running and playing sports. So, limit the time you spend on the computer. Without a doubt, computers are very bad for your eyesight. Unlike a television or video games you could play a long distance away, a computer is played just a few inches from your face; over time, your eyes will be so used to sitting close to what you are looking at, that when you back up you can't see well at all. I knew a kid who played video games from about a foot away for long periods of time a day. Today, unfortunately, the kid has very poor eyesight; if that kid just knew the consequences of being that close to a screen, he would have thought twice about it. Think twice about how close you sit from the computer. If I were to ask anyone of you what you could find on the internet, many of you would say, ""anything."" Could there really be too much information? As a matter of fact, there is. You could be looking up a topic and something inappropriate, that has nothing to do with the topic comes up; kids don't need to, and shouldn't be watching or seeing these inappropriate sites. Its bad for kids, so stop it and be careful online! After reading this essay, I hope you realized that computers are bad for you in various ways. As a matter of fact it's physically, mentally and socially detrimental. So, next time you're on a computer, don't look at the little things, but the big picture of your health and well-being!"
504	506	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I'm writing because I've heard that some people think that computers are very useful and some people think they're no good because people spend too much time on them. I think that they are good to have because they are ways to keep in touch with friends, and to research the things you're curious about without going to the library and having to look for the book you need. The computers are good to have because they can provide access to online stores that they don't have as a physical place to walk into or if they do it's far away. I think it is good to have computers because when you're younger and have no more friends nearby you might have been really close to them but you can still connect with them. You can email each other or search them up online, to try to get in contact with them again. Also if your family member is far away and you really can't talk on the phone because of the money, then you can IM them so you can talk without having to spend money. I also think it's good because if there's any problem with getting to the library you can look it up online. Also the computer is available all the time, day or night. The computer is good for doing homework you can't finish at school or need more resources for. I also think it's good to have a computer if you need something but you can't afford it at a regular store; usually if you go online you can find it and buy it and save money, also some items they have online aren't really available in an actual local shop. I think that it's good to have computers but not be on them all the time, they're very helpful, for friends, school and for everyday needs.
505	507	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think that many people are not benefiting from using computers. There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer. By using the computer, people are getting less exercise, not enjoying the nature, and not interacting with family or friends. By using the computer, people are not getting many benefits. As I mentioned, people who use computers too much are getting less exercise. By not exercising, this could really affect people's health. From recent studies by health organizations, a significant percentage of people who use computers too much are overweight. That is an extremely high statistic! By computers affecting this many people's lives is ridiculous. This many people really shouldn't be over weight. If these people aren't getting exercise they could become addicted to the computer. If people are getting addicted to the computer they might start to do bad things with the computer. They could publish bad things, go on ridiculous websites, and watch horrible things. The worst is probably watching bad things. It really puts a bad influence on everyone. Lastly, if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes. If you are staring at the computer all day, your eyes might not be used to seeing everything else. It's hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next, causing strain. Clearly, being on the computer is bad for health. Not enjoying nature is also something that people aren't benefiting from. As you might know, getting fresh air is good for everyone. Its always nice to smell the nice spring air after being in school all day. Many people don't do this because as soon as they get home it's straight to the computer. These people are losing a lot of refreshment. I recently interviewed a neighbor and she told me that, ""many people don't get to see what's going on in the world because of computers."" They never take the time to look at anything that's going on around them. By keeping updated with the outdoors, you learn more. You never know what topic might pop up in school; you could always benefit from checking on mother nature. Lastly, there are always animals that need help. Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home? I have and by helping these animals you're saving a life. Many people don't have this opportunity because they are on the computer. Obviously, there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature. My last reason is that by being on the computer you're not interacting with family or friends. In some cases, the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent. If you're a parent you need to help your family with everyday chores. I know, they can be annoying to have to do but you're helping your family and that's important. Also, if you are a parent that has children they always need help. Some kids are younger and don't know how to find information for a project. But, that's why a parent is there. But, if the parent is on the computer they aren't able to fulfill this requirement. I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger. Lastly, family parties and computers do not mix. From past experience, when family has come over my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say ""hello"" to anyone. I find this extremely rude. I just hope that family members don't get offended by this. Clearly, using the computers takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should have limited time on computers. By using computers people don't have enough exercise, aren't enjoying nature, and spend less time with family. Thank you for reading my opinion."
506	508	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, since electricity was invented, technology has developed at a rapid rate. Computers have gone from the size of a room to twelve inch flat screen monitors, becoming faster and more efficient. In our modern day society computers are crucial tools that help organize files, do research, and pleasurable online networking. Computers teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and allow people to socialize online. Without computers wouldn't life be difficult? While routinely doing our everyday computer tasks, seldom do we realize that we are writing which frequently over works nerves in the hand causing tendonitis or arthritis; typing on computers is quicker and less harmful to the hands. ""Hand eye coordination helps improve balance and athleticism,"" said @PERSON1, the chief orthopedic surgeon of @ORGANIZATION1. Some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity. There are several portable computer devices that can be brought outside to use while walking like a @CAPS3, encouraging movement. Every since I was ten years old I dreamed of going to @LOCATION1. Although I couldn't afford a plane ticket to @LOCATION1, I was able to use the internet to take virtual tours of the vibrant landscapes and ancient historic venues throughout the country. With the help of internet I was able to see a far away place and experience the country as if I was there. @PERSON2, the creator of an online webcom called @ORGANIZATION2, created this computer system in order to allow people to connect all over the world by giving them the opportunity to see and speak to anyone they choose to. I frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college. Through this program we can socialize with as if she's at home and learn about her college experience, bridging the distance between us."
507	509	1	3	Dear editor of the local newspaper, @CAPS1, you know that the average person spends three or more hours each day on the computer? The time taken up by staring at a blank screen can be spent helping the community, exercising, or simply having fun with others. All this valuable time is wasted because of computers, spending large sums of time on a computer lessens your time with family and friends, causes health concerns, and alternately @MONTH1 became addictive. First of all, computers @MONTH1 prevent you from spending time your family and friends. Often people come home from work or school just wanting to relax, so they seek comfort from the web. However, a more relaxing activity could be playing a game with your family or going out with your friends. After all, nobody lasts forever and your time with loved ones is precious every day. This precious time is taken away by computer technology, which will last longer than any human and doesn't even provide comfort when someone is down. For example, a teenager would be on the computer while someone is making fun of them. This does not benefit the individual and the bullying could lead to depression; decided with her family or friends, they could probably share a few words and make everyone feel good. @CAPS2, time spent on the computer is less spent with family and friends. Secondly, computers can be bad for your health, straining the eyes, and people with trouble seeing. Typing a lot may cause strain, and the need for spending more time on the computer gives you less time for exercise and often tempts you. If someone finds a website they really like, they will quite want to visit it often, perhaps even multiple times a day! Along with websites, @CAPS3 games and networks are also very popular and addictive. Computer addiction can lead to health problems (as talked about before) and withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. It's very important that people stop spending a lot of time on the computer to make sure an addiction is prevented before it can even start. In conclusion, computer technology is hurting the human race and could be preventing greater things from happening in individual's lives. There is less time to do things with your loved ones, more negative impacts on your health, and a rising number of computer addicts because of our modern technology. However, all this could be prevented if people simply spent less time on the computer and more time engaging with the world around them.
508	510	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers do have positive effects but the negative effects are much worse than the positive effects. @CAPS2 bullying happens everyday. Not only that but when there is a computer around kids aren't going to be exercising. Those machines also damage the eyesight of humans. @CAPS2 bullying is the worst effect of computers. This form of bullying has happened to many and we have lost many to it. @CAPS2 bullying happens to @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids. @CAPS2 bullying is a disease and it has to be stopped; kids have committed suicide because of it. Not only that but the life of kids have been threatened and taken by it. Without computers this disease would be stopped. Childhood obesity is a big problem in @LOCATION1 and part of the reason is because of computers. Kids shouldn't be on the computer, they should be outside running around with their friends. Computers are an addiction that kids can't break. Computers aren't just bad for kids, they're bad for adults too. Computer screens are harmful to the eyes if you stare at one for too long. Your sight is very important to living. Sight is, most of the time, your most important sense. Now you see why computers don't benefit society. Online, people are harassed to the extreme. The bright computers screens are harmful to the delicate human eyes. Kids should be exercising outside not sitting at home on the computer. Everyone should pull the plug on their computers for good and never turn them back on, for the sake of our health and our children's future.
509	511	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think a computer is not something bad for you. A computer can help you do many things; @CAPS1 could help you learn, chat with friends, and @CAPS1 can entertain you. A computer can get you successful in life; @CAPS1 helps you learn a lot of things such as computer engineering. Computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers. @CAPS1 is very challenging at first, but when you look @CAPS1 up on search websites you'll find all your answers. Chatting is the number one thing kids, adults, and teenagers do. @CAPS1 is good and bad in a way; @CAPS1 is good because your phone bill wont be that high up so you save minutes. @CAPS1 is bad because @CAPS1 can also ruin your eyes just remember don't get too close to the screen. The computer is all about fun, you have millions of websites you can go on. To have fun for example @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com; those are the three main ones I go on they are so fun. They have tons of games for kids and for adults too. I have proven my point that computers are not bad for you because they can help you learn, they lower your phone bill, and its also very fun. Yes I know they might take exercise time away, or hurt your eyes but who cares just make up a time limit so you have time to exercise. Do not get too close to the screen because @CAPS1 can hurt your eyes, but with responsible use, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.
510	512	1	3	Dear People, Computers are not a really good thing because @CAPS1 you think about it you never want to get off, always chatting or social networking; you can always find something to do but you are wasting your time on the computer. You can do anything you want but I think too much is a waste of time. @CAPS1 you have kids you would not spend time with them; you can help your kids with their homework, eat with them, watch t.v., spend time relaxing, but some people like ladies with kids go online and never get off. You have to have time with your kids so they don't have bad habits so they don't stay out to late. You have to have time for your self, clean the house, cook food for your husband, go out shopping, take your kids out to the mall, just enjoy your life. Computer gives nothing to us just gets us lazy. @CAPS1 you work you have to think about your work, maybe hang out with your friends; don't be on the computer for @NUM1 hours. You can do other stuff, call your friends over or go shopping, do cleaning in your house; computer does not give us anything its just waste of time @CAPS1 you social network. There is good thing about computers; you can find anything you need, look at stuff, talk to family from far away. @CAPS1 you use it in good ways its a good thing but @CAPS1 you never log off Facebook or other stuff its not good to stay on. You can just go to the beach or go to the gym; you have lots of stuff to do other then going online and sitting for hours. Just try not to go online and just go out and go somewhere instead, finding a healthier balance for your daily life.
511	513	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremely helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a necessity in our life is because research for school and work is faster and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend hours on the internet. For example, I myself have a heavy workload that requires constant research. The internet is a quick way to get the research done. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutely needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Think about the times when a big assignment is due, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable to do by hand. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type one English essay and a fluently written paragraph. My final grade was @CAPS2 because I did not type it on a computer. Typing things on the computer comes in handy outside of school also, my whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up reports and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficient. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a necessity for living.
512	514	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, People are using too much of their time on the computer. Instead of seeing the world through their own eyes they are seeing it on videos or in pictures on the internet. It isn't natural for people to be internet fanatics. Earth is a beautiful planet, it has trees, mountains, seas, and humans. We created the internet and people love it more than the very rock they're standing on. The planet should be explored not surfed on the web. People should see the natural world before all natural land is covered by cities and factories. People use the internet way too much for plans, for business, for entertainment, for a social life! All of this has been done with ease before we could even turn on a light bulb. Life is a gift and people spend it on an artificial life. For example a game, @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most popular addictive games ever made. In this game you make a character in a medieval planet while you battle monsters with other players. Some people think that game is more fun than life (personally I think it is) but it is not their real life. It is just a fantasy for people to escape their meaningless lives. I write this for support that some day people will understand that this is life. So, live it to the fullest and experience the real world around you.
513	515	1	3	Dear, local newspaper @CAPS1 it's true technology is blinding everyone. More and more people are being sucked into electronics and less people are caring about our planet. There are so many great things out there that could be put at risk. People sometimes say that if you spend a lot of time on the computer they would be able to find cures for the diseases out there. Those are just lies to stay lazy and waste their life on the computer. What is going to happen to all of the sports in the world. The players are going to get old and they will retire and if no one is going to take their place then the games would be canceled. I am a big fan of football and I don't want to see it get canceled. Some of my friends are saying they are addicted to the computer and I always hope they get out of that habit because what's going to happen when they get older they are going to need a job. If they stay addicted they won't want a job and then they won't have money, they can't pay bills, and they would lose their house. Why do people say they could find cures for things by looking on the computer we all know that's not true. They need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer. They may not want to but they would have to look in books and do some heavy thinking before they can find the cures. I hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad. If we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet Earth will stay around longer and we could make the world a better place for everyone.
514	516	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many opportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it might be something like research for a project or essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even be taken, where a student can be taught through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. E-mail and instant messaging. These methods of communication have become extremely popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is because if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally this is not the case. Usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a persons life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me on this matter.
515	517	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers are fairly new, everyone has one everyone wants one! There are so many great things they can be used for. But are they getting used too much? As a student and a teenager I know I am using mine way more than I need to. Sure they are fun, and sure they're very useful but they are time consuming. You might be doing work or chatting with a friend, but you're also just sitting there. Being on the computer takes away from lots of exercising or doing other activities. I am definitely not saying to stop using your computer totally, because they are a great invention. But why sit on a computer chatting to a friend that lives right down the street, when you could be outside, playing a game of kickball or something fun. It would be a good idea just to chat on line with the friends or family that live far from you like in other states. Another time that I would say to use your computer is when doing some work, projects or homework. Or even if your job involves doing research. Computers are a great tool to use. But most people abuse that privilege and go on other websites that have nothing to do with their research. So if you need a computer for school or work stay on task! That way you get what you need done. If you are a student or have a job which is the common day person it's hard not to use the computer. There are so many helpful things to use it for. But that doesn't mean you need to be on it all day and night. Take about @NUM1 minutes to an hour of your day talk to those people you never get to see, do your research. Then get up and enjoy nature. You don't need more then an hour. I strongly agree with the experts people are spending way too much time on their computers. Use it to benefit you, and to help you not to keep you from getting bored. Don't abuse the fact you have internet if you need research get that done stay on task. Remember an hour a day is more than enough! So get off your computers go outside and stay fit and healthy.
516	518	1	3	Dear local newspaper, More and more people are using computers these days. Some people think computers are an improvement to society. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and spending time with friends and family. I believe that computers can be a bad thing. I think this because some people spend too much time on them, it's one of the leading causes of obesity, and it interferes with people's social lives. According to recent studies, about @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people spend most of their time on their computers. Many of these people spend their time on online games and socializing websites such as facebook and myspace. Others spend it shopping or learning. Some of the online games include world of warcraft, runescape, and many @CAPS1's @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 games. Many people who spend most of their time on the computer are or @MONTH1 became obese. According to @PERSON1, spending a lot of time on the computer is one of the main reasons for obesity. Many experts agree that computers are a leading cause of obesity. Between @DATE1 and @DATE2 more people have been using their computers more often. The obesity rate has increased between then too. Most of the people who spend a lot of time on the computer don't interact with their friends and family much. This can lead to ruined relationships, loss of friends and the chance of losing your love with family. Many experts, such as @PERSON2, say that a person can become depressed from not interacting with friends and family. He also says some of the people who became depressed start thinking of suicide. Spending too much time on the computer is a bad thing; would you want to spend too much time on the computer even after hearing the cons of it? I believe spending too much time on the computer is bad for everyone and its negative consequences should be carefully considered.
517	519	1	3	"Dear Readers, Computers have a large presence in the world today. Most people in the @LOCATION1 have at least one and the number grows still. These computers are bad for people. They cost a lot of money, cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. Computers cost a lot of money. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintenance, they are very expensive. Dr. @PERSON2, a computer science expert, claims, ""The average computer costs @MONEY1. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with antivirus programs and other protection. Now we could be talking about @MONEY2 at the very least. With yearly maintenance costing about @MONEY3 per year, you can see how expensive these machines really are."" @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. That's a lot of money going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems, there are health issues too. Computers take a lot of time away from people. When a computer is used, the user doesn't move around or exercise. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the @LOCATION1 has skyrocketed, but it's not just food. Some experts are now contributing computer use to lack of exercise, and therefore, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS3 matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but that could be a problem. It is quite easy to find something out, or research a topic using a computer. Before computers became popular, people had to work and look for @CAPS4. Now that it is so easy, children @MONTH1 begin to think things come easily in life. @PERSON1, a pediatric psychologist, says, ""The mind of a child works in such a way, that most things they encounter are absorbed and become normal. If a child becomes used to the ease of searching an item on a computer, he will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not he @MONTH1 become frustrated and not be able to do what is needed."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll takers agree that finding @CAPS4 on the computer is quite easy. What are the children of the world being taught? Life is easy, a false statement. Computer use is a growing problem. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problems, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing. Computers are bad for the people of the world; they take our money, our health and the minds of our children, and we must be cautious of their pervasive influence."
518	520	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think computers are good for you because you can talk online, they teach hand eye coordination, and other stuff too. One reason is they help you with your hand eye coordination, for example they teach you how to look while typing. @CAPS3 we don’t learn hand eye coordination we won't know how to do other stuff that requires hand eye coordination. The second reason is if you have a webcam you can use it; for example, when a family member is living in a different state you can see their face and talk to them like you do in person. The last reason is searching the web because if you want to get @CAPS4 tickets for a trip look online. It's the best way to get them. Researchers say @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say getting online is the best way because you can see when the @CAPS4 takes off, when the next @CAPS4 is, and also when to come back home. All in all I say that computers are a good thing because they help with your hand eye coordination. Also, if you have a web cam you can see family members from different states and see their face and talk to them like you are talking in person. The last thing is searching the web for @CAPS4 tickets; if you want to go somewhere far away go online and see when the @CAPS4 leaves and comes back because researchers says that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that getting online for @CAPS4 ticket is the best way to get them. Ask yourself, would you like to have the web to search or not? The benefits of computers for communication, coordination, and convenience are clear.
519	521	1	3	I believe that people should enjoy nature more than computers. I say this because computers can sometimes get addicting. The people who are addicted will only know about stuff on the internet. People need exercise. They will not get exercise by sitting in front of a computer all day. Computers are addicting. The people who spend most of their time on the computer are the people who are addicted. When they get addicted they will probably fail in school because they do not do their homework. Don't you hate it when you feel weak and tired? Well that is how the people who sit at computers all day feel like a lot! @CAPS1 people want to stay healthy then they should get some exercise daily instead of sitting in front of a computer all day. A lot of people get annoyed when they don't know about stuff when it happens. Most of the people who do that are the people who are mostly on the computers. I say that because the people who are mostly on the computers only know about things when it is on the computer. That is why I strongly believe that people spend too much time on computers rather than in nature. This is because firstly computers get addicting, secondly people need exercise if they want to be and stay healthy, and lastly if people like to know things the only way they will find out is on the computer, which limits their real-world experiences and connections.
520	522	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I have heard that you guys are deciding whether or not computers have a negative or positive impact on the society. In my opinion, I believe computers have a very negative impact not only to adults but mostly to students too. Computers in general can be distracting, very dangerous, and give people less time to exercise. Computers in total do have a bad impact on people. Some people say computers are not distracting, well I say they are. Computers have various websites such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework. @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are websites where you can chat with friends and see peoples pictures. These websites can be very interruptive when trying to do something important. For example, I am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying. If I had to choose between doing homework or chatting on @CAPS1, I would choose @CAPS1. But if you actually think about it, are these websites benefitting anybody? Homework and studying can actually benefit you in doing better in your studies and further on in your life. In total, I believe computers are a big distraction. When people go on the computer they go on without worrying a little bit. They don't know the danger behind it. These dangerous computers have people on it called online predators. Online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others. One website in specific that I heard was very harmful is myspace. This website is even more dangerous then @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Myspace is like @CAPS1 in a way but very dangerous. For instance, my mom told me that one of her friends daughter had a myspace and became friends with a guy she didn't know. Of course she didn't worry because according to her he seemed a nice guy so she gave him her number. Good thing her mom saw it, otherwise something bad would have happened. He ended up being an online predator. Lastly, computers can make people unhealthy. People who stare on computers non-stop can make them not exercise. For example, not playing sports such as soccer, volleyball, and tennis. This is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy. This is why computers can make you not exercise. In conclusion, computers can have a very negative effect on people. It can be very distracting, dangerous, and unhealthy for not exercising. In total, computers can have a bad impact on people, and we must be aware of these significant risks.
521	523	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I - like many other people my age - love to sit in front of a computer and explore its wonders. But that does not mean that I spend my whole life on it like others. So I can see what too much computer time can do. It has made kids my age more aggressive, have health problems, and care even less about the environment. More and more kids are falling into those traps. Too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive. I know from past experience that when you bother people when they are on their obsession, they will snap at you, yell, or even start swearing at you, or maybe get violent. If someone stays up too late on the computer, the next day could mean that they're cranky from the lack of sleep. This aggression @MONTH1 cause others to get aggressive in response, which @MONTH1 lead to a verbal or physical fight, which (hopefully) nobody wants. Another issue too much computer time can cause, @CAPS1, are even more health issues. Staying inside all day will keep people from getting the necessary amount of vitamin @CAPS3 they need which is a vital nutritious vitamin that comes from the sun itself. Not getting enough vitamin @CAPS3 throughout a person's childhood can result in getting an illness called @CAPS5 later in life, which never truly goes away and hinders people from doing the things they love. Too much computer time also means people aren't getting enough exercise, and with the way we eat now, those two things can add up to making a person obese. Others who do not want to get the proper amount of exercise or eat right and at the same time do not want to become obese, @MONTH1 turn to anorexia. Neither of these weight problems are very good for you, proving my point about the health issues of too much computer time. The issue I will have you read @CAPS1, is how people will become even less caring of the environment. Some of the big technology companies side-step around environmental protection laws to find cheaper ways to make their products and the thing is, no one cares! No one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology. Everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers, ignoring the long-term damage to our planet. Now, I'm not saying that having any computer time is bad. I'm just trying to prove that too much is bad for you. That with too much computer time, people can become more aggressive, have health issues, and become even less caring of the environment. Therefore I urge you @CAPS1 to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time, to make it known to everyone in the city. It might help us make a better future.
522	524	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people are using computers more often. Some people do not agree that computers are good. I think computers are good though. They help you learn more, they are like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and when you are bored you can go on the internet. People nowadays are becoming smarter and smarter. One of the causes is the internet. The internet is like a big book. It holds tons of great information. There's probably information on the internet that probably no one knows, until they read it. Plus the fact that the internet is quick & easy. Also, the internet keeps you up to date on things going on in the world. Without the internet, we would be nowhere. Surveys show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the internet for information or projects for school. Also, on the internet you can buy things you can't find in stores. Going to the library is a pain. You have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library. What if you don't have a library near you? Then what will you do? You could go on the internet. Plus, with @CAPS2, people could look for a book all day, not find it and find out that someone else has it. What a pain. There are some people like college people, who don't have cars. So how are they supposed to get to the library? Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 don't have cars. When you get bored, what do you do? Eat? Sleep? Lay on the floor staring at the ceiling? No. You go on the computer. The internet has all sorts of fun games and websites. It also helps you make new friends from all over the world. The internet is also a good way to stay in contact with close friends or relatives. Also, if you are a photographer, then you can sell & share your photographs online and you can also advertise your company or business. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 @CAPS3 either have no backyard or have nothing better to do. I think that the internet is great. You can learn all sorts of information, you don't have to go to a library, and you can play games when you get bored. Isn't the internet great?
523	525	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that computers are very beneficial to our society. They are very helpful when it comes to homework, you can talk to people online and you can make plans without even leaving your house. First of all, computers help us a great deal with homework. Many kids are adamant about it, but with the help of a computer, they will be more willing to get it done. For example, when I have a difficult science or social studies assignment, I can research it on the computer. Also, @CAPS1 I have a test just coming up and I left my textbook at school, I can just study on my computer. So, as a result, computers are very helpful with homework and studying. Secondly, computers make it very easy to communicate with others. For example, talking on the phone costs money, and why would you spend money when you could text, chat, or use voice for free? Also, many people use e-mail because it's very easy and you can send documents to others. Let's say that I had a work document on yearly company profits and I needed to get it to my boss. No problem, I just attach it to an email and I don't have to drive anywhere. Finally, my last point, computers make it very easy to make plans or connections. I know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love to travel, but you need plane tickets. Just go to the website and do it online. It's fast, easy and safe. Also, @CAPS1 you needed to make reservations for something, like a hotel, you just have to go online, pick a date and when you arrive your room will be ready. I can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night. In conclusion, computers play a huge role in the world because they can help with homework, it's easy to communicate, and you can make reservations without even leaving your house. And the best part about them is that they are fun and easy to use!
524	526	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 to this article more and more people use computers, and the people who support advances in technology believe computers have a positive effect on people. I disagree on your part. I believe that computers can ruin your life, and make you go blind. Firstly, computers can ruin your life if you stay on them for too long. A computer is a little device that can almost let you do anything on it. The computer can let you look up where your friends live, you can play tons of games, etc. I remember this one time when I was watching channel @NUM1 news and a @NUM2 year old kid fainted from playing a computer game for too long. See, I told you that they can ruin your life; all it takes is a couple of hours to like the computer too much. Secondly, computers can make you go blind because the screen of the computer is too close. The computer is built so you can do things on it, but unfortunately the screen was screwed in too close so when you have to see something on your computer you literally have to stick your face on top of the screen. I remember one time when my dad bought a @ORGANIZATION1; my dad was on that computer all day and when he got off it his eyes were blood shot, the month after that he got glasses. See, I told you sticking your face too close to a computer screen can hurt your eyes and strain your vision over time. In conclusion, the computer can ruin your life and can make you go blind. The computer is bad for you, so you should stop and think about what I wrote in this persuasive letter before you spend another hour staring at the screen.
525	527	1	3	@DATE1 @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, I believe that computers in today's society have a positive effect on people. I believe this because if people use it for education purposes, to chat, email, or to research, it does make a difference in peoples lives. If you use the computer for educational purposes like games, you could really learn a lot. For example, I help my sister with her multiplication on a math game we have. Also, I learned to type with Type to Learn @CAPS3 on my desktop computer at home. Many other people use it for these reasons too. They also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation for school or work. Others might only use it for chat and e-mail. These things can still benefit our society though. Using the computer for chat, such as, Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter can also benefit our society today. These websites benefit us because we can meet new people, catch up with old friends, or even talk with current friends. Also on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3 we can e-mail people instead of instant messaging them. For example, if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write an email. If you just want to say hello you could use Facebook, Myspace, or Twitter if you have an account. Computers do benefit our society today in many important ways. All of the reasons in my letter support my position on whether or not computers benefit our society, and I firmly believe they do.
526	528	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, I think computers are a benefit to everyone. My first reason why I think computers are a benefit is because if you don't know about something and you want to learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some research on it. The best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away. The internet has information on anything and everything, providing answers and detailed explanations for countless topics. my second reason why, is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them whenever you want. Its not just webcam either you can also go on facebook and other sites like that to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another, sharing life updates instantly. my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. Their software on them to write, do projects, and plan things etc. plus most of the modern day society uses computers for stores and business's to keep track of things, managing inventory and customer data efficiently. Well that's why I think computers benefit us. I told you why I thought they did and how they serve as powerful tools for learning, connection, and work.
527	529	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, I agree that the effects computers have on people can be very negative to people, but they should realize what they are doing to themselves and what they can get themselves into. Starting with people are on the computers more then they are using the phone, this takes effects on people sitting around on their computers and not cleaning their homes and taking care of their homes; but instead they are on the laptops or desktops, neglecting their daily chores and responsibilities. Secondly parents and children spend most of they time on websites to talk with their friends for example webcam and aim, this takes affect people because they can go on the phone or meet them up some place, yet they choose the isolation of digital communication. In conclusion, people, but mostly teenagers and a little bit of adults up to ages twenty to thirty like to go on different websites sum as myspace.com, facebook.com, formspring.com, and more this constant rumors and can end up in bad or goods situations this can be a horrified effection on these people that do this very often. Some people and mostly teens, and that can be caused it will always be a he say she say, this is why people should log off immediately. Most importantly people should become aware of themselves or people they might know or might know, knowing this putting into negative situations and putting them in harm.
528	530	1	3	"Dear School Newspaper, I have a very strong belief that children and adults are spending far away too much time the computer. Please consider the following that computers have a negative effect on people. Furthermore, a large percentage of parents agree with experts that teenagers spend way too much time on the computer but less time with friends. When I was little I rarely ever went on the computer. But now my parents have to consult me to leave the computer multiple times. Ever since teens have joined Facebook, myspace, and twitter, they are addicted to it and can't stop going on it to check what their friends are posting. Physcologist Dr. Smith states, ""Teenagers who are on the internet for multiple hours a day, can't concentrate in school because their minds are on what they've going to do on the internet when they get home."" Wake up, check messages, check Facebook, go to school, get home, check Facebook. This is the daily reutine of a teenager in the modern era. Secondly, going on the computer constantly can cause health problems. A significant percent of teens who non-stop use the computer have to wear glasses or contacts, because of overusing the computer. When I use the computer without a break for multiple hours I get a terrible headache because my eyes can't take any more of it. ""When teenagers stay up late on the computer they are, have fatigue the next morning."" A pediatrician notes that middle schoolers are very much the most popular users of the interner, because they are mostly very tired and unfocused at school. People who stay up very late have very black saggy lines under their eyr, so if you see a person like taht they are a overuser of the internet. Most children who are very pale also never get to play outside from using the internet all the time. Lastly children are missing out on the beauty of nature. Children who don't get enough excersize, cant think clearly becasue tehre is no oxygen in their brains. Obesity is begginning to tape a toll on children who only sit inside and eat junkfood. Children who rarely play outside and excersize become overweight or obese. A high percentage of children in stratford almost never play outside and excersize. As I was in elementary school, we had recess but now in middle school we never have it. The only chnace we have to play outside in the spring and in the summer when it's warm, yet many choose to stay indoors."
529	531	1	3	Dear The School Board, My opinion on computers may be the same as others or different. I believe that computers help our society. They give us more knowledge on whatever subject we want, it helps us connect to family far away places and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? My cousin lives in Australia and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer. What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? In you get exercise and can expose the scenery. With a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep. Say your just a young kid and you're always located to see Paris but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years. How would you learn more about them if they're gone? A computer has information about anyone you chance. You may not be exercising but you're expanding your knowledge aren't you. Yes you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person. However, what if the book doesn't have the information you are looking for? You could end up reading for hours when the certain information you want wasn't even there. A computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds. Why waste your time? Now is the time where our technology advances. Why waste your time on something when you've got what you need right at your fingertips? So what are you waiting for? Go learn what you want right now! Haven't seen your cousin in a long time? Start up your computer and get talking. The time is now to embrace these incredible tools.
530	532	1	3	Dear Local newpaper editor, I think computers benefits us in a good way. Weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. Computers are now a benificial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world. And learn about new things everyday. What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that. It's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. It could be online chatting and even sharing photos. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. If people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. And if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. And if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already I can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read I gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. And how I think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them and how different everything would be.
531	533	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers are a part of our advanced technology. They have a positive effect on people because computers make almost everything easier, they can teach people things with tutorial or educational websites and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and they keep people entertained in their spare time. Computers are becoming more and more advanced everyday and that's why I think people are so addicted to them, yet they do have positive affects. Computers make things a lot easier for a lot of people. If you really think about it, a lot of things that we use every day such as books, nice clothing, and music on the radio would not be here if it weren't for computers. We would have to hand write those books and hand sew our clothes, a process that would be incredibly slow and inefficient. As for the music, we would just stomp our feet and clap our hands to make music. If ancient egyptians had computers, they would have built millions of @CAPS4, completing their monumental projects in a fraction of the time. Our computers have programs like microsoft to help me do a major school assignment neatly, allowing for easy editing and a professional presentation. Computers have positive affects in this way. Everyday after I finish my homework and I go on the computer most adults think that all that us teenagers do on the computers are facebook and myspace. I do admit that I go on those websites, but if I notice that my grades are not in the best condition, I go on websites that can help me understand what I'm not getting. Ninety percent of the time that I do that my grades go up and I get a satisfying grade. I have also taught little cousins of mine how to add and subtract using the computer in pre-school with interactive and colorful games that hold their attention. Computers are helping schools teach students. Besides education, computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire or by streaming movies and music. When I go on the computer, I might need to research something that I have interest in. Maybe I might want to know when @LOCATION1 was invented or, if the universe ever stops. Maybe I don't want to watch @CAPS5 all day to keep me entertained. Computers will save me from bordom by providing endless information and entertainment options. When I use a computer, I am not addicted. In fact it has a very positive effect of me. Yes, I might stay up countless hours, talking to my friends on facebook, but to me that's a part of being a kid and maintaining social connections. The next day I might learn something in school that I want to search deeper into. That is what the computer is for, a tool for expanding knowledge. Without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have @CAPS1. Their effect is the most positive effect on people, ever in my opinion.
532	534	1	3	"Dear Readers' @ORGANIZATION1 the Local Newspaper, I am almost certain you interact daily with computer. You use computers to write, play games, look at pictures, and print work out. There are dozens @ORGANIZATION1 practical uses for computers but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage @ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity, expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time. Readers, hear my arguement and by the end @ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise nore or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also plenty @ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"". But do all these & exercise plans really work? According to a study done by the @ORGANIZATION1, the largest cause @ORGANIZATION1 obesity is actually computers! The students at @LOCATION1 had one group @ORGANIZATION1 people try a regular commercial diet plan & another group @ORGANIZATION1 people do exactly what they've been doing... Except without their computers. They found that the group who refrained from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 them computer. A familier day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use computer eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. Unfotunately, these happens @NUM1 days a week & the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time that could be spent playing outside or participating in sports. Readers please, try avoiding you computers for just one week, and you can forget those jet plane sized diet plans. Another negative @ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to his room to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack @ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage. Teens become absorbed in their virtual society lives and become attached to their computers. What they don't notize is that they're totally forgetting about their families! I know I've made the mistake @ORGANIZATION1 becoming too attached to socia networking to remember my family but luckily I have a stable family environment. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships, don't let that happen to you. Your children are without a doubt, through, the ones affected by this technical revolution the most. From the time they were toddlers your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though. Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to profanity, & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sides"". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's & emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without-even knowing. An enormous part @ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ORGANIZATION1 a young age. Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ORGANIZATION1 computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives. @CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @CAPS6? Faced with the concerns @ORGANIZATION1 lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise, separation @ORGANIZATION1 families & mappriate material for children do you really want your children, or even you for that matter, using a computer daily. Think a head @NUM4 years from @CAPS6. Will you say ""I wish I used my computer more"" or ""I wish I spent more time with my family""? In the end, the choice is really up to you."
533	535	1	3	In my opinion having computer is good to have. Therefore I think having computers are a good thing because nowadays computers are very useful. Also a lot of people are using the for there businesses. My there reasons are to look up information, home work, and to talk to friends and family online. My first reason is to look up information on the computer. If you have thred reports to do it will best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be easier and faster to do. For an example using the internent will be faster then looking for it in a book. For that it will take at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes for the interenant if you were to lookingit in a book it can take at least @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes because you have to search through an index and flip through many pages. My second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @LOCATION2 then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse, but with a computer you can video chat for free. Or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework? Like if you have a friend that moved to like @LOCATION1 you can to online and you can talk to them and stay connected easily. My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. If you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home, which lightens your backpack. Also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home and potentially forgetting it. For the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @NUM5 to @NUM2 minutes using the computer then using the book for @NUM5 to @NUM8 minutes of manual searching. In my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays. My three reasons are to look up information, homework and talking online to friends and family. Even though people don't like computers or don't like to use them, their benefits for communication and education are undeniable.
534	536	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects. Some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise, you can talk to strangers, and no interaction with family and friends. One of the effects of computers on people is no exersise. One of the most important effect of computers on people is no exersise. Right now many people in the @LOCATION1 are obese because of bad eating and no exersise. One of the problems is that these people don'@CAPS2 get off their computers and couchs to go outside and be active. These people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch @CAPS2.V. and go on the computer for hours on end. So computers have a big effect on how these people live their lives, promoting a dangerously sedentary lifestyle. Another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers. Most kids in the @LOCATION1 are a member of a social network like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen to gain a child's trust. This can get many kids in trouble if they are not careful on these websites and share personal information. Since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people, creating a potential safety risk. Another bad effect is no iteraction with family or friends. When people are on computers, they focus on whats on the computer screen and not about their surroundings. Being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends in the same room. Not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer and not practicing face-to-face conversation. This can become a serious problem if a person becomes too adicted to the computer. This can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken and drift apart emotionally. In conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems. Computers can cause tragaties in families and/or in that persons's life if their negative aspects are not managed carefully.
535	537	1	3	Dear, local Newspaper, I hear that you think computers have an effect on people. Will I disagree with what you say. I think computer will help us learn, and do things faster. Haveing computers helps the community learn more. My first, reason I think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs. With the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of @LOCATION1 where they type every day and work hard on important documents. They also learn more and more facts about the sociatis and the world through online research. Without knowing how to type you @MONTH1 not get any top class jobs in today's modern office environment. My second, reason telling us that computers are helpful is that it helps your children do better in school by learning how to type for high school, and learning math, sce, social studies and language arts through educational software. Computers also helps kids at young age do math and other subjects with their favorite character, like dora, @ORGANIZATION1, elmo, and others, making learning engaging. So learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time. Which i know your parents would like. Even new born babys can learn how to read, write and do math with special programs and grow up and can be president one day with a strong educational foundation. My third, reason is that it helps send things all over the world instantly. Without computers we would have to do it old fashion style with letters that take days or weeks. Also with computers you can talk to family member that live far away from you (In state or country) and you have not see them in a long time through video calls. Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day and reconnect. You can also buy thing off the computer from the comfort of your home. In my conclution I told you that computers can not effect people negatively by telling you that your child can do better
536	538	1	3	Do you think computers benefit us? I think they do. There are many ways computers do and don't benefit us, but the ways they are useful are a lot more significant than the ways they are not. For instance, kids in school use online textbooks, which is a great help. Also, a lot of companies have websites so we can see what they are about before we choose them for a job. We also use computers to look up directions to places we want to go so we don't get lost. School kids benefit from computers a lot because they would otherwise have to carry home tons of books, but instead they just go on the computer to access the online book, saving them from carrying home a number of really heavy books. I know I like to go on the computer better than carrying really heavy books home. Also, when you look for a home decorator you can just go on the computer and look up websites to see some of the work they have done. It helps out a lot because then you don't have to find out the hard way that the decorator is not good and end up spending a lot of money on a room you don't like. Furthermore, if you are looking for a job you can look up a company's website on the computer and contact them to see if you can get an interview, rather than wasting your time going there in person. I also use the computer to look up ways to get somewhere and it's a lot easier to do that than to start driving and get lost. I know they have GPS devices now, but they cost a lot more than simply using a computer to find out. I still think computers benefit us in many ways, such as using an online textbook instead of carrying your huge textbooks home, and using computers to look up websites or to search for addresses. That is why I think computers benefit us significantly in our daily lives.
537	539	1	3	Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways of doing things for other people, and people have to manage a lot of their money and bills on the computer. First, they let you communicate with other people. Did you know that a significant percentage of people in the United States have family in a different state and never get to see them? Well, that's when computers come in handy because computers have a thing called video chat, and that's where if you have a webcam you can talk to people from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera. Also, there is a thing called an instant messaging service that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online. My mom got an account on one and now she is chatting with friends she hasn't seen since high school, and she is very happy to see her old friends again. Secondly, computers have a way of helping people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and handle it. For example, if you have an email account you can email someone if you have an emergency. There is even a feature on the computer that can call someone or even call for a long-distance emergency. A large portion of people in the country say that a computer has helped them in many situations that people think of. Thirdly, computers help people with paying their bills and with their money. Did you know that a majority of people in the United States pay their bills on the computer and manage their money on the computer? I know my parents do, and I know a lot of other people that do too. If we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything, and that's pretty much why we need computers, because without them managing finances would be much more difficult. In conclusion, people really do need computers because they help us connect with people that we know, they have helped many people across the United States, and lastly, computers really help you manage money and bills effectively. Everybody should have a computer for all of these very good reasons.
538	540	1	3	A prominent organization notes that a large percentage of the world says that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about foreign people and places, and also learn about where your family came from. So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benefits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who use a similar service or a different account platform. Another way is to go on a website where you can become a pen-pal with someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download an application where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you need to learn about another country or another explorer? Well, you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will help us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by assisting you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when you come home from school, who is going to help you with your homework? You can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out where your family comes from is to use a website to research your family history. For example, there are helpful websites to learn who your ancestors really were in life, such as if they fought in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of a relative and type their name into a search engine. There are many reasons why we should keep computers, but here are some: to interact with people, to learn about other places, and to learn about family history. I hope you understand the value of computers better now.
539	541	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing nowadays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that they are hurting our society? This isn't right because you need them for education, people aren't on them all day, and they are essential for a job. So how could those things be harmful to society? You're right, they can't be. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have a modern education without a computer? If you are working and you need to get another degree for your job, you can't go during the day, so you can find a school that has online schooling for at night. That way you don't miss work and you still get your schooling. Another reason is for a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project or to cite your sources. What if you need to type an essay? What do you do then? No computers could mean a hampered education, and you might end up working at a place where you don't need an education. But people aren't on the computer all day, so what does that do to society? Nothing at all. Kids and adults go outside and have fun. They go on the computer to check emails, play games, or look at social media. But they have enough responsibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit inside, then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way, not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for themselves and don't need others to do it for them. So it really shouldn't affect you at all. What if at your job you need the internet? Most office people have a computer to talk to others by email or to fix problems. People who work at a bank need the computer to access your account to get your money. People that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding figures or keeping a record. The video game industry is a perfect example because the programmers use a computer to program what you want to happen in the game, and that takes hours to complete. So how are computers harmful to society? Because I still don't see it. Education, the fact that people aren't on them all day, and their necessity for jobs are really good reasons that computers should be accepted. So everyone, I strongly encourage you to reconsider what could happen without computers in our world.
540	542	1	3	Let's go back around several decades ago. Those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out-of-state family. Days when knowledge was only found in books, and often found slowly. Those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision. Computers change all that. With nothing but the tap of a finger, we can communicate with people worldwide, or search the web for some new information. A large percentage of people's relatives live out of their state. I can relate, with many cousins in one state and others in another. Without these instant messages and emails, we would more than likely talk to them once, maybe twice a year! Some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. For me personally, and I know many others, that interaction would be impossible without these modern marvels. With all the modern technology out there, nothing has me as amazed as the webcam. You, with this tool, can talk face to face with someone on the other side of the world! The world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures, and what better way than to talk to them directly. What people many years ago would never think possible, we can use at a moment's notice, and yet still, many people don't appreciate it. My relatives and my parents' friends have both used the internet to reunite with old college buddies or see how far away friends are doing. These are grown-ups, using the tools available to improve their lives. The internet goes beyond teenagers on social media platforms. What you can find online still amazes me. The information you could get out of many non-fiction books, you could find in just minutes on the internet. Any question, including personal ones, anything, can be answered. Years ago people would have killed for this power, for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to know. I see the point people make about needing exercise, and they're right. But in five minutes on the web you could have an exercise routine planned out, with modern techniques and styles. The computer has anything for anyone. Looking for some place to enjoy nature? Search for it. In seconds there will be thousands of results. Missing a dictionary? There are literally hundreds of sites to find a definition online. People take these machines for granted and assume we could live without them, but I doubt they ever realize how much we really need them. The technology is there. Why not use it? I could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin or another kid from a different country. I couldn't pass up a chance to check up on some old buddies that moved away. Thanks to computers, I have that opportunity. I have that chance. I've been shown an open door to find out everything I could want. Man can't know everything. But these days, he can find out anything. I'm not sure if the computer has changed the direction of advancing technology, but I can tell you, it has definitely charted the course for our modern world.
541	543	1	3	"@CITY1 @CAPS1: I believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. They allow you to see places you have never been. If you have a long distance relationship you can talk to them through video calls, and they have many good excessories. What if you were looking for a new home? You could use google to search for selling homes in a certain location. Then you could use it for finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price. Computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place to live or visit. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather for that time and find local attractions. If you are going somewhere far, you can use the computer to find a plane ticket. Computers are helpful when it comes to places! The excessories on the computer are endless. One big excessory that people like to do is games. Games are great to get your mind going and to pass the time. Practically all of the games require hand-eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. You need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out, which really tests your reflexes! If you are bored, games are very fun. I think that games are a great excessory. Some people have long distance relationships right? Well, if you have a computer you can have an online conversation. This relieves many people when they know your not there in person. If you have an email, you can talk"" to your friends that you dont see at school over summer break. This gives you a chance to connect with them and stay updated. Myspace and facebook are very similar social platforms. These are what you can use to talk to your friends at school and share photos. Computers are very useful. As you can see, I have stated many good reasons like excessories, ""talking"" to people. Also, places. Many people use computers in their every day life for work and for fun. Computers are awsome!"
542	544	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people, are that computers are used for the wrong reasons. Teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family in person. But instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it, spending hours alone in their rooms. Therefore, the computer and the concept of surfing the web is bad because it consumes childrens time too much and because educationally computers can give the wrong information. Until the late @DATE1's, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist in @CAPS1 opinion, this would have been better for social interaction. For example, children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays. At this age middle schoolers and high-schoolers should be focused on their grades and their homework. But instead, they get too addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 that they forget about their school work and their priorities, and their grades start to slip. Even adults have this problem. For instance, business people, accountants and assistants will consistently be checking their emails even after work hours. Also, people who work at a desk or in a cubical all day are almost always on the computer, which can be unhealthy. In other words, I believe that jobs should cut down on how many workers they have on a computer, and family homes should cut down on the amount of time each member spends online. Another reason I think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information. For example, people could insert their own perspective of an idea on websites such as wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. If a student was doing a project or just homework and decided to surf the web for some @ORGANIZATION2 or information they dont know if their information is correct or just an opinion. I believe this means that the internet and the web don't beat books or history for accuracy. In conclusion, computers have a bad effect on people for the reasons of it consumes children and teen's minds, people use the internet too much and because educationally computers can sometimes give false information which misleads learners.
543	545	1	3	I think that computers are amazing. Computers are an amazing way to meet new people online from all over the world. You can find friends who share your hobbies and interests, which can be very exciting. This connectivity makes the world feel smaller and more friendly. It is wonderful to have such technology at our fingertips for building new relationships and learning about different lives. Computers truly open up a whole new social world for everyone to explore and enjoy from the comfort of their own home.
544	546	1	3	Dear, newspaper @CAPS1 I think computers have both a positive and a negative effect on people. On one hand you can learn about places without having to go there and get facts about what is in that country such as food, goods, and jobs available. On the other hand the computer can also be a problem because kids could spend to much time chatting or playing on the computer and not enough time going outside to play or going to sports practice. But sometimes bad things happen from talking to people on the computer. Some people on the computer aren't always how they say they are, which can be dangerous for young users. So if I have to choose a side on whether the computer is helpful or not I would have to go with not. The computer is not very helpful because a lot of bad things could happen from @NUM1 little mistake on the computer like putting your name, address, or picture online where strangers can see it. This is why we must be very cautious with how we use computers in our daily lives.
545	547	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I @CAPS2 that computers has benefits to society. First, it gives and teaches you social skills. Next, computers can help you learn new things online. Finally, computers also teach you hand-eye coordination. In the following you will see why I @CAPS2 computers have its benefits to the society. First, computers has its benefits to society because it can teach or give you the social skills you need. On a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends in online communities. Therefore, you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country through these conversations. Also, you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you in the moment via messaging apps. So as you can see, Computers has its benefits because it can teach you social skills. Next the benefits it has to society is people can learn things online. For example, you can learn how to use a computer if you don't already know how through simple tutorials. Also, you could play online learning games for free or buy a @CAPS3 with more options for learning and skill development. Another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it on educational sites. So as you can see, Computers benefit society because you can learn all types of things online. Finally, computers how its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination. For example, you can find all types of games using hand-eye coordination using the mouse and keyboard to control the action. Also if you just want time to go by you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with others and playing fun games. Believe it or not, you can find boat loads of jobs that uses a computer for any of these tasks also, as you can see computers have its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination and gives you some free-time entertainment. In conclusion, computers have its benefits to the social community. First, it helps you learn your social skills. Next, you can learn about any subject online for free if your not the one paying the internet bill. Finally, it benefits you by teaching you hand-eye coordination. So as you can see, I @CAPS2 that computers benefits society in plenty of ways for communication, education, and personal development.
546	548	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Computers are not something to be afraid of. They help many people in different ways, like the doctors, teachers, students, scientists, and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life. Hasn't a computer already helped you today? Because of that, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. Who has said that by using computers you dont interact with your family as much? Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e-mail. With e-mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, dont bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just ""happen"" to get lost, try going on Google maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than creating a simple map, it can give you precious information! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids. The kids can look up a topic and in a few seconds they have all the information they need! In most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper. What is also nice is that you dont need to go through huge books for one small piece of information. It is much easier, looking it up on the computer. Speaking of not using big books for imformation computers don't use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow! Millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future. people have already created touch-screen computers and computers will grow even more! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing, but look at the facts! Doesnt the newspaper write the newspaper on computers? If they didnt, they would be having hand cramps all the time! And what about docters dont they have your medical history on the computer, if not all these papers would get lost! Like in the beginning, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future, and we should embrace their benefits."
547	549	1	3	"Typing and surfing the web can be exciting; however, is it worth the health risks that there are now? Before computers were discovered, human's healthyness is triple than what it is now. Computers can be useful and may have some benefits; on the other hand, they are harmful and they should not be used as often. They have unprofessional websites, they are not helpful when it comes to excercise, and they disturb an individual's privacy. Many kids are let onto computers every day and they wonder off to the websites that the internet has to offer. Consequently, kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on. In fact, a large percentage of kids enter unproffesional websites and many of them have no parental vision in the room alone. Therefore, these kids act up in homes and at school. However kids are not the only ones who are affeted by this. Computers have a disadvantage of being hacked or virused from uncensored websites. MOreover, computers crash or don't allow use of computer documents because of these viruses. Ever since the internet was invented obesity and lack of exercise in a person's schedule has skyrocketed. A scientist, named Dr. Smith from the university, said,""Many computers users have lost their use if muscles, but they have gained to over a pound of fat causing a lot of them to not be able to do activities they did before."" I believe that this is definitely true because I remember that the same happened to my sister. She ate more and her excercise time was spent more on the computer that on her body. I know that some say that computers help in hand-eye coordination, however, is it really worth more than someones healthy body? Many things are sold on the internet that are not in stores, but you don't trust the internet when buying these products. You don't trust the internet because you have heard so much about someone'es identify or money taken away from them, which shows the significant dangers they pose."
548	550	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect future generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""Young generations are becoming way to dependant."" says Mrs. Johnson, my fifth grade history teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""Raising a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and raising a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who may have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you might not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you might be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be."
549	551	1	3	Dear local news paper I think the computers benefits society. The three reason why so is because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the abilit to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk onlone with other people, and computers help to make better technology. I belive that computers have positive effect on people. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the abilit to learn about faraway places. Nine out of ten students use the computers to do homework. I was visiting a prompt last week. I ddn't know alot about the country so I whent on the computers and you know what i got to know more about the country and things to the computers I got a A+. So the computers have a positive effect on people. The next reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers allow people to talk online with other poeple. Say if a man whant to a and he left his phone at home how will he take to his family why he had computers he can talk to his family online. My family is back in my hometown I haven't see them in four years so I whant to the stor and get a wedcan and i get to see my family afdter four years. So computers do have a positive effect on people. My last reason why computers have a benefits in society is because computers help to make better technology. Computers help people to make better car, light, an so on. Without computers society is because computers help the soldiers to win wars and even help people to live. My father was dying without computer my father would die thang to computer I have father today. In the end computer have the benefits in society the three reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway place, and computers allow people to talk online with other people and computers help people to make better technology. Spending time enjoying nature is good computers have benfits society better. I hope my three reason can persuade the local news paper to agree with my position that computer have a positive effect on people and their future.
550	552	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think we should have computers because I would help us meet new people, seeing new places, and learn new things. It would help us meet new people because we can e-mail them, and chat with them on programs. It will also help us see new places because we can goon the internet. And look up place see. It will also help us learn about new things because we can talk to people and they could give us some ideas on what to learn about. This will help us all because we want to learn about new things, talk to new people and see new places. this is a good idea for all of us. We can all benifit from this because it's good thing for everyone to have. I think we should have computers because it would help us meet new people, seeing new places, and learn new things. This is a great thing for everyone. Not just some people. I hope you take this letter consideration. Because it will help everyone learned about new things and improve our community as a whole.
551	553	1	3	I think computers are bad because people use them all the time to go on Facebook and other websites that are sometimes a waste of time. People should not go on the computer as much and instead explore outside and go for walks, explore the woods, and exercise. Most people do not get a lot of exercise that they need because they are on the computers. People should stop making computers so less people go on them and so people can exercise more and lose weight. If people stop making computers, some people would stop going on bad websites. People should only go on the computer for research for projects or for homework like typing papers. Parents and kids need to exercise to stay healthy because people do not want diabetes when they are young, so it is really important to exercise so bad things do not happen to your body; people need to stay healthy and exercise. All the computer does is mess up your brain so you do not exercise. So get off the computer, exercise, explore outside, go on walks, and explore the woods; you never know what you will find in the woods. Go see what you can find. There will be some interesting things you will find like different kinds of bugs and insects. You might even find a ladybug. There are all different kinds of bees and you might find one that looks like something you have never seen before. So go outside and explore; you will never know what you will find. Go for walks and you will never know what you will find, like different kinds of houses and the colors of the houses, the different kinds of front doors, and different kinds of houses like small, medium, and large. Some houses will have different colors. You will see the different kinds of animals like dogs and cats that are in the window or outside. You should go hang out outside. You should go hang out outside with family, friends, or both and look at the different stuff in nature. Maybe you can take pictures and make a scrapbook out of the pictures. Maybe go in the woods and walk around. Just get out and exercise and you would think to yourself, I should get out and exercise more often instead of being on the computer because I am having more fun hanging out with friends and family and I am doing exercise at the same time instead of being on the computer. In addition, the computer was getting boring and repetitive, while the outdoors offers new discoveries every day.
552	554	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, My opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers have a good effect. It's good for education, mind exercise, and communication all over the world. It could potentially be bad because it would keep you from getting exercise, being with your family, and being healthy. But I still think that there are ways to use computers without the bad cause. Some ways computers are good for you are that you can get a better education when you have websites with so much information. Sometimes this information is false, but if you find the right websites you can get the correct information. With all of this information you can exercise your mind to do better in life. You can easily talk to people on the other side of the earth and get more information from them. If I were to say computers are bad for you I would say that it keeps you from getting enough or maybe any exercise. Computers might be the reason why there are so many obese people in the country; when computers are used too much people part from their family and go into different fantasy worlds that sometimes get you addicted to them. And staying for too long on the computer causes problems. You can get hurt by just sitting for a long amount of time at once. Being on the computer for too long can also cause eye problems where you will begin to lose your sight and will need glasses which will get thicker as you keep looking at the computer screen for hours and days. But even though computers cause so many problems we can prevent them by using the computer to help us. People don't get enough exercise but with the help of computers they can easily find times and ways to exercise so that they can stay healthy. They can also find information about how much time should be spent on the computer to not have sight decrease or get worse. Some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other through video calls. In conclusion I think that computers are more beneficial then harmful because they give you a lot of information for everything and you can communicate with people all over the world. And computers can help you prevent those things that are bad for you by showing you ways to use the computer that won't harm you, making them a valuable tool when used wisely.
553	555	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society. I believe that computer use has a negative affect on people. They get to interact with people who aren't safe, they spend less time exercising and they get into more trouble than before. Spending more time online in chat rooms causes people to meet predators. Take my friend Sarah; she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. She thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was nineteen and a model. She flirted with him on and on, day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really forty-two and a pervert. Sarah is not the only one that this has happened to; three out of five people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this. Website designer John Smith says, ""More and more people everyday are falling for lies over the internet and getting in sticky situations like getting asked to meet the person."" Remember the saying ""Don't talk to strangers?"" Spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising. At tryouts, this girl Jessica wasn't in shape enough to stay up with the players. Instead of being out practicing like the rest of us, she was in her house talking on Facebook. She wasn't prepared when tryouts came, time to show what you had, so she didn't make the softball team. The next year she made captain because she was out training everyday before the big day. She's not the only one with a laziness problem. Four out of every ten Americans are couch potatoes and choose to go online than to stay in shape. Nutritionalist, Dr. Adams says, ""This generation is worse than the last. They complain when they can't do something but that's because instead of going outside, they're on their butts watching television or online."" Going outside is a breath of fresh air, what do you have to loose? Kids seem to get in a lot more trouble online then they ever have on the streets. They're out posting threats, dissing each other, sending personal messages or pictures and worst of all sometimes hurting someone so bad they commit suicide one year. The neighbor was more popular than this lady's daughter so she created this person online that the neighbor fell for. The online ""guy"" began trashing the teenage girl so bad she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer Chris Brown have been caught in sexting. It's embarrassing, inappropriate and against the law yet it still happens. These people are not alone. Three out of five people have gotten in big trouble through the internet. Governer, Mark Davis says, ""The internet and phones are destroying this society. There's too much real life drama already."" Can't you see something wrong with all of this? My opinion on computer use all is that we should use the computers less before we all start interacting with people that will scare us, become couch potatoes, and get into huge trouble. It's really not worth the damage of getting scared, hurt, lazy, or taking your own life over online interactions."
554	556	1	3	"Dear newspaper, Computers are everywhere in our nation. We have them at home, at school or at our work. Many people believe that computers are bad for our health or we don’t spend enough time with our family. But I disagree. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, let us learn about faraway places, and also let us allow to chat online with other people. Have you ever had trouble with hand-eye coordination? Sometimes mine is ridiculous! But when I get on a computer it gets to be much better. Experts say that seventy percent more people with hand-eye coordination have improved by working with computers. A teacher at my school said, ""My students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand-eye coordination already."" I agree with these experts too. So many people nowadays that have a computer have passed their hand-eye coordination test! When I grow up and soon get out of high school I want to travel all over the world. But first I want to be educated on where I go. That is why computers are so helpful. I can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where I can learn all about the places I want to visit. One time my parents told me we were going to the city for the day. So the night before I did a bunch of research of different shops, museums, and places to eat. The computer helped me so much that if we didn't have it then I don't know where we would go. President Obama said, ""One time when I had a big meeting in Japan, I had no knowledge about it. So I logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture, language, and much more. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have a computer."" I love talking to my friends. But once I'm home none of my friends are around me, so I have nobody to talk to. If I also don't have the phone available then that makes it even worse.But, if I go on the computer then I can talk to bunch of my friends. I can go onto my webcam to see who I am talking to or I can go onto another website to get an instant message. I love talking online because one of my best friends in the whole word moved down to Florida so I don't get to talk to her too much. But if I go to the instant message website then I can talk to her as much as I want. Eight out of ten people sold in a survey that they have someone they talk to over the internet. So I say the computer is important in our society. It helps complete a number of tasks. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and it even allows people to talk to friends and family online. So I don't think computers are bad for us or our health. I think they are important and needed for modern life and connection."
555	557	1	3	Dear, editor of the local newspaper. I believe that computers are good for the future. The world has made many changes with its technology. I know not spending time exercising is bad but learning about new things can't be that bad. If humans didn't have technology some of us wouldn't have heat or fresh water. We use computers in life. Computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world. Some people who have friends far away can use a computer to talk to them. Or even people who can't talk use computers to talk for them. The hospital uses computers to save lives. Computers save lives in so many ways its scary to think if they were all gone we could all start dying. We use computers in hospitals; if there weren't any computers the chances of finding a cure for something would take too long and the person could die. Let's say someone has what looks like a normal fever and you just say that's what they have. Two days later they died because they had some disease and no one knew until it was too late. We use computers to purify water. We use computers to keep us warm during winter. We even use computers in libraries; why the library? Some people who have medical illnesses and can't talk have these little computers that can have something typed in them and it would say it. Most people use some kind of computer to talk, chat, and text. They might find it easier with a computer. The world's a big place and many people don't know much about it. But if you go online you could find out stuff that you may never knew existed or just plainly didn't know about it. Kids even use computers for school and school work. So many people rely on technology to get through their life. Computers even help people in school for people like me who broke their arm and have to take some test on the computer. Like me. Now so many things in the military, airforce, and navy are computerized. The military uses thermal sights on guns and tanks so they can identify people in even the most craziest weather. It could even locate a wounded soldier. They're even working with computers to make better bullet proof vests so they will be more lives saved in war. The airforce uses computers to talk to people on the ground so they could protect them. They now have planes that can be flown by a man far away and this would save their lives even if it gets shot down. This also allows them to see people hiding and they could tell the people on the ground to stay down or whatever. The navy uses radar to see if there is any boats or submarines coming near them and they have a heads up if there would be an attack. We use this to help with other advances in the future; we could soon have a computer that could help out people in far places like where there is a higher poverty rate. Computers save lives, allows communication, and is a good way for research. Computers is what we use to live; we need them to survive in our modern world.

You can develop better hand-eye coordination skills, interact with friends and family who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about cultures all around the world, along with the people who live in those countries, without ever leaving home. In my opinion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more and more every day. First off, there are many skills you can develop on the computer. For example, when playing interactive high-paced games, kids get a sense of awareness, timing, and hand-eye coordination. Not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great education. Many people even work from home, thanks to their computers, which allows for a flexible schedule. These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. Secondly, why buy a ticket to a far away country that's fairly expensive, trade in all your money for the money they have there, go through the hassles of baggage, etc., when you could simply go online and look it up on the computer? You can go online, look up some of that country's recipes, language, pictures, and people without the hassle of going there. Not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to travel, or have to do a report on it, instead of making their way through countless textbooks, newspapers, and libraries in general, they go online, search their country, and they have most, if not all the info they need right there. So not only is getting the information faster, but you learn it in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. Finally, the internet helps people connect. Leading experts from the U.S.A., or Family security agency, says that since people have started using programs like Skype and Facebook, many more families, who live in different countries, have been able to re-connect and get to know one-another. For example, if you have an uncle who lives in another state, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each other and talking face to face. I think this is better than simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. Same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. A quick Facebook account or Skype, and you'll still be good friends. So all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant cultures and far away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. I don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. So yes, computers have a positive effect on people."
557	559	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Imagine a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a monitor, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirrels running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend too much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative effect on people. First of all, people spend huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by a popular magazine, it stated that a large percentage of people between the ages of thirteen and eighteen prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since the early 2000s, child obesity has increased by a significant margin! A leading researcher at a prominent university states that the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watchers monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions in recent years because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by a noted scientist and his colleagues at a research institute, a majority of teenagers spend almost fifty percent more time indoors in front of electronic devices, most frequently computers, than they do outdoors. Another expert says, due to the new advancements in technology, people tend to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In the past, more than eighty percent of families ate dinner together; now, only a small fraction eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a monitor. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don't have the personal support and guidance from family because they don't spend time together due to the frequent use of computers, there is a higher chance that child will commit a crime compared to the lower chance a child would have decades ago. Do you want that for our youth? Now imagine a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the birthday of a family member. This happy thought won't become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time in front of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?
558	560	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Even though computers have many benefits, they also have many faults too. I believe that computers and the technology these days have many more negative features than positive. Some of those faults are it's bad for your eyes, you don't spend as much time with family and exercising and the usage of going outside is less often used. Yeah, I get it that computers are very useful but they also kill your eyesight. If you haven't noticed, more and more kids have been getting glasses and contacts, due to the use of staring at a screen all day. I know more than a dozen kids that have glasses now, I also know that over half the parents I know now have glasses for the same exact reason. Using these computers is great for looking up your homework, but if you stay on it for over an hour or two a day you'll probably become addicted to it and eventually you'd lose your eyesight. The usual time a kid spends on their laptop a night is about three or four hours and the time they spend with their family is maybe an hour if the parents are lucky. Personally, I feel technology is the reason parents and kids are less connected. Often the kids go on the computer to go on social media or chat sites and talk to friends that they see everyday, so I don't find their friend, mostly the girls but why not just talk to them in school since you see them for several hours everyday. The use of technology is being abused! The computers were invented for knowledge not scandalous ""webchats"" or ""social media pages."" The world would be so much happier and mentally fit if we stuck to original idea of technology. Now kids don't even take a fast step outside their bedroom after school, it's pointless! Most people even eat in their room so they can talk to people online. So that's taking the parents' time away from their kids. Now that you have read what I had to say about technology now a days, wouldn't you agree that it just takes time away from your actual life? I think it does and hope that you agree with me that we should use it more wisely."
559	561	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, I believe that the computer is good for the society because teachers and students do most of their studies online. We spend most of our time with our family and friends so we want a little bit of time to ourselves. We learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of facts. After reading this essay I hope you will agree with my position. Many students put most of their notes on a laptop and study what they did in class on the computer. Whenever they need to look something up for history class they have internet. High school students often don't like going to the library so they go on the internet as their source. So if a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat the computer will write the project neatly. The computer and internet has become a big source of learning to our society, don't you agree? Our time most of the time is spent with our families and when our friends come over, we go outside and play with them, or sit down and play games. With our families we have so little bit of time to ourselves that a computer won't hurt nobody. We don't go on forever; we use it to connect with friends or search for something useful after we have talked to our families. If we go online searching for information, they couldn't find it elsewhere. People interested in countries they cannot visit can use the computer as a resource that is up to date. A computer is constantly updated with new facts about everything. I hope after reading this you will agree with my position. Mostly every person has a computer and it does not affect their lives a lot in a negative way. A computer is a great resource for the public. People who want to meet new people can use a computer to do so; students who want a great grade on those projects can present it nicely. I believe agreeing that computers are beneficial would be a very good choice for our community.
560	562	1	3	Dear Local Community Board, Did you know a large percentage of people today use the computer for necessary reasons? It's true! It's a fact the computer can help you with keeping in touch with friends, getting the latest news, and even gives you map access. Let me tell you some important facts about the computer. Of course, we all have friends in different cities and/or states! Instead of over charging a phone bill, many people keep in touch via email. Email is high tech, and super easy! All you need is your friends email address and you can send them anything from a friendly hello, to recent pictures of the family. Teens love to chat with friends and they're able to get to know each other better through the computer. Sites such as Facebook are certainly popular with this generation of teens. The fun messages are what makes everything so great. Keep in mind all the available ways to get in touch with friends and see why the computer is so great. Every time I log onto the computer I'm able to see the latest news updates! I remember going on and seeing something pop up about my favorite band breaking up. Thanks to the computer I got to read all about it and I was extremely glad I'd seen that because if I hadn't I wouldn't have got to see their last concert. While I do understand, the computer may not be the healthiest activity, it definitely is a great news source and everyone reads the news whether it be political, or about celebrities. Knowledge about what's currently happening in our country, and exercise is equally as important therefore, I'd be the first to support the computer as a positive effect on people today. Have you ever been lost? Maybe you didn't write down the correct directions, or couldn't remember. Next time look up directions on the computer! It's so helpful and could really save you a hassle. There are so many websites that have maps you can print out, such as MapQuest. It's a much easier, clearer way to understand where exactly you need to go. In my opinion it can help so much and it would be the right idea to go check it out today. Imagine all the places you could go just by getting a map online! Keep this in mind as one of the many great things about the computer. Now that you know some positives about the computer, remember how they could benefit you! Being able to chat with friends is one of the best! Don't forget about hearing the latest news, and finally, never get lost again, just print out a map. There's no doubt in my mind the computer has a very positive effect on every one! The time is now to get out there and utilize a computer for yourself and see the advantages.
561	563	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I think computers are good for many things and are useful for anything. I believe this because every year new and exciting applications and websites are created and make life easier. For example, ""Skype"" is a way to communicate with friends and family. For me I have family out-of-state, and I am happy when I go on Skype and speak to them, seeing their faces on the screen. Or I can also talk to friends after a long day of school to share stories. Another example is ""youtube."" On youtube They have how to videos that show you step-by-step instructions on anything, even on news and music entertainment, which can be very informative. Other applications like Word, help you set up writing essays and crafting stories with proper formatting. On powerpoint it lets you make slide show videos for school projects to presentations, adding images and transitions. Even excel let's you make graphs and any chart imaginable for organizing data. And let's not forget Google. Google helps you when you need info on a person, place, or thing, providing answers in seconds. And by using Google it helps you when you need information for other applications like Word and more, making research simple. See, computers help everyday people with everyday life, proving their immense value in our modern world."
562	564	1	3	"The question is does computers have a positive effect on society? Yes computers definitely have a positive effect on society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allows people to talk to other people online. Computers put a positive effect of people. First, Computers teach people hand-eye coordination. I mean, computers help people learn how to use their eyes and hands at the same time, like when moving a mouse and clicking. A survey conducted by a leading university shows that eight out of ten people have better hand-eye coordination that use computers than that don't. Professor Johnson says ""people that use a computer are much more coordinated than any other person, it is a great discovery."" You might be thinking that a computer would make you less coordinated BUT, computers really help hand-eye coordination in people through practice. In conclusion the more you get to learn how to use a computer the better hand-eye coordinated you will be. Second, computers allow people to be able to learn about far away places and people. i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway country without paying a fortune in money to go the country. I remember the time when my mom and dad was going to go to France to see a lot of the landmarks and my uncle came to my house with a brand new computer and my parents ended up staying home and saved themselves a large amount of money by taking a virtual tour. Famous explorer John Smith says ""before I go anywhere I always google it on my computer to learn about life, climate, etc, on the country. I know you might be thinking that it would be a better experience to go to the country but, it is really expensive to go to very faraway countries. In conclusion, computer can help you save money and help you learn from your own home. Third, computers lets people talk to other people online. i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends and share updates. A survey done by a research institute. Shows that seventy-five percent of people talk to other people over those websites daily. A famous social worker Dr. Evans says ""when people use these websites it helps them with their vocabulary and social abilities by practicing conversation."" I know you might be thinking those websites are dangerous is at, but good virus software can prevent danger. In conclusion social abilities are up with computers through online interaction. Lastly, computers teach people about faraway places, help social abilities and learn hand-eye coordination. Computers can help society and learning so help the growth technology today by embracing its benefits."
563	565	1	3	Dear Newspaper, The world that we live in today is full of technology. Everything from check out aisles at the grocery store to coffee makers at home are being upgraded all the time. The technology has many great things about it, but theres also a huge down fall. The most common technology device is the computer, its a great thing to have but its also very bad. The computer can be used to bully, it can take time from exercising and it even takes from your social and grammar skills. We all know the websites such as facebook, myspace and Twitter. They seem harmless but its really just a place for harassment and anonymous meanness. Their said to keep friends in touch, but kids use them to say hurtful things about each other, which can be devastating. Half the kids in my eighth grade class have admitted to either getting bullied or bulling over the computer. If so many kids are getting hurt by them then why do we all keep using computers? Many kids might say they don't spend to much time on their computers but seven out of ten kids in my school admit that they do, often for hours. Checking the computer is the first thing they do when they get home from school and the last thing they do before going to sleep at night, replacing other activities. All the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child, like playing outside. I've seen many kids gain excessive amount of weight because they don't eat proper food they don't exercise and they shut down from reality all because they are obsessed with their computers and the digital world. kids are even getting portable computers, thats how addicted they are, carrying them everywhere. Do you want your kids like that? However, all these programs and websites that are on computers have a way to interact with friends, and socialize online. But all of this is taking away from your social skills, even grammar, because you don't practice face-to-face conversation. Most kids and teenagers would rather talk over the internet than face to face, and half the time they don't even spell word correct or use proper grammar, using abbreviations. In the long run all this talking over computers is going to hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job, where good communication is key. I know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and e-mail your job, which is true. But the time spent, kids getting bullied, and the now lack of social skills is not worth the risk. We need to cutback on our societys use of computers because it will help us all when it really counts in real life interactions. Just ask yourself do you want your kids getting bullied? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to loose your social and grammar skill? Just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind about computer usage.
564	566	1	3	Computers are not having a negative affect on society. In fact when you talk with someone online it helps build relationship within that person, strengthening your connection. A use for computer that is also use full is hand eye coordination, which is important for many tasks. Education is also a useful thing you can use with computers, opening up a world of knowledge. You can learn about faraway places and monuments from the comfort of your home. The myth is that computers ruin relationship between friends and family however, In some ways online communication improves them, when you go on skype you talk with some one online in real time. By doing this you actually improve the bond between you and that person, making you feel closer. This information proves that computers can actually support relationships over long distances. Hand eye coordination is also something useful that a computer can teach when you type on keyboard your fingers improve on reflexes and speed. If you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve significantly over time. Some people might say that a computer won't help you much but it really is positive to use for these skills. A computer is more educational than what most people would think, offering vast resources. On certain websites you can see something that can teach you, like historical facts. If you go on a historian websites that someone could learn about different types of people and cultures from the past. Lots of critics say that a computer is not educational and is just for games. However when you look at the facts a computer can teach a lot about countless subjects. It is easy to believe a computer is not a good thing because of some negative stories. But when someone looks at the facts A computer is a great thing to own for learning and connecting. If critics can take these facts into consideration a computer is a better object than what most people say, providing many benefits to its users.
565	567	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers can be a good thing and a bad thing for many reasons. First i think it's good because it can help school work like to do a research project and for other things that you might have to do for school, such as typing essays. A second reason on why computers are helpful is because it teaches hand-eye coordination through typing and using the mouse. It also can have people talk to their family member from a other country through a web-cam, making the distance feel smaller. All their computers can be really helpful they can also be bad for your health and family life if overused. I agree that it can give less time exercising, instead of being on the computer you can go to the park or walk your dog and many other things then just being on the computer all day, which is healthier. It can also destroy your interacting with family and and friend if you stay in the house all the time using the computers and your family and friends want to spend some time with you and your just on the computer, ignoring them. Local Newspaper newspaper where the reasons why i think computers can be a good thing and a bad thing are shared. I mostly think that computers are a good thing because if we didn't have computers we wouldn't have most of the things we now have in the world if it wasn't for computers, like modern medicine and communication. That's why i think computers can be more helpful just depending on the way you use it and how much you use it, with balance being key. Those were the opinions i had on computers and their role in our lives today.
566	568	1	3	Computers they give you information and research from a far distance from you. But is it good for you? Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe they may be correct. I believe that a computer can be used by finding things out from far distances, it can also give hand - eye coordination, I also believe that it is ok to use a computer if you are just using it for research or other needed actions. When using a computer it gives you the advantages of researching and studying far away places. This is good because some people have interest in places around the world and can learn about different cultures and geographies. Also, students need computers now adays, their teachers give them typed assignments, or power point presentations that require a computer to complete. Also, parents use computers for work or maybe to get away from work to take a vacation they need to book it some how online. Also, some say using a computer can give you Hand eye coordination. Well, it does in fact when you type. Some may not know this but typing is a skill, some people type fast some type slow and some are average typers. Also, to teach little kids maybe even some adults, people have created a typing game on the computer it will teach kids how to type by making it fun and engaging. Also, some people who type super fast go to get test to see how fast they type the test gives numbers like seventy words a minute. People naturally type about thirty words a minute. I believe that people should be able to go on computers for needed actions such as research. Many kids have learned about these other websites such as facebook, I tunes, youtube, and twitter. Some become addicted so they never got off. Also, being on all of these websites and more try to give you things that may give you a virus. Viruses can come in many strengths some can crash your computer some just send boat loads of pop-ups to your monitor. I feel that it is ok to go on the computer to do research or book vacations. If you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse. Over all I believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be addicted so called toy. Computer have a positive effect on people. Just dont be addicted and got outside... and have exercise with friends and family too to maintain a healthy balance.
567	569	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Local newspaper do you think that the computer is a good technology in our generation today? Well I do not believe it is a good technology in our generation. Do not get me wrong. I do not like to go on the computer but their are so many reasons why computers affect a lot of children and some adults in this generation. Like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long they do not get enough exercise. That is why kids these days are so over weight there are more than several million children over weight because of the computer and the sedentary lifestyle it promotes. Like for me I use to love going on the computer and I still do but I see that the computer is destroying my health. A second reason why I believe is bad for the generation because there are a lot of inappropriate sites on the internet, where kids that are young and younger could be logging on to and being exposed to harmful content. I think that people all over the world should start enjoying nature, go travel the world and experience things firsthand. Start doing things that people cant do on the computer like playing sports or hiking. I think that more kids should start interacting with family and friend more often instead of talking to your friend all the time online. My last and finally reason that is a big thing is going on in the computer is people bullying other people the internet, local newspaper have would you if you have any daughters, sons, grandchildren. If they was getting bullied over that internet or concern them to kill them or hurt them, it would be a terrible situation. I think you would feel horribly and you would want that person to go to jail. For now on I am going to think when I spend all my time on the computer how it affect my life and my family, friends. I believe other people in the world should do the same thing and reflect on their computer usage.
568	570	1	3	"Your spending too much time on the computer your mom and dad well out. You realize it's time to get off and go outside. You spend about a significant portion more or less on the computer each day, but there are good reasons. You can multi task on it, you can talk to friends and family you haven't seen or talked to forever, and lastly, you can spend time outside as well as in side. If you were smart you would not listen to those experts who say it's all bad. Have you ever heard of the word multi tasking? It's were you can do more than one thing at a time, for example you can read and talk, or text and talk, or walk and be reading something. You have all these things you can do. Another example is when your on the computer you can listen to music and talk to friends or read. What you can even do is you can talk to your friends, listen to music, and do homework. What i mean when i say homework is when you have to type up an essay or something. The fourth and final examples is that about a majority of us can multi task effectively. One of my friends told me that they just bought a laptop with a built in camera, and now they can talk to people they haven't seen in a long time. ""I haven't seen my sister since she moved to california several years ago, so i thought I would use the camera on my laptop to see her."" said a mother of the family. A computer or laptop can be good for talking to friends or family you haven't seen in a long time. Another from a student say's. ""If you were smart, and understanding you would now why everyones on the computer so much"". When your on the computer and your friends start to talk to you about things you understand why, you usually don't see your friends unless its lunch or before class. Computers help talking to friends move easier than writing letters or waiting for class to get out. You get off the bus and you realize that it's pure sunshine out. You decide to do some or all of your homework now so you can go out and play. Your outside for about a few hours. When you come in its around evening. You eat dinner and ya just want to unwind from the days gigantic adventure so you go on the computer. You can go on the computer and still enjoy time like wild animals outside too. Only responsible kids plan their time accordingly. In conclusion it is important that you now that computers are good for multi tasking, talking to friends and family you havent seen in along time, and that you can go outside as well a stay inside now is the time to call, if you were smart you wouldn't listen to these experts and find a good balance for yourself."
569	571	1	3	Computers today are much different from computers back then. They help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I think that computers help people in many ways, like teaching a hand-eye coordination. They're useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they haven't seen in a long time and computer skills are required in the real world. Hand-eye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination. This helps because if one has to type a multi-page report, then one who has good hand-eye coordination, or typing skills, can finish a report in a short time like a number of minutes or so. If one has poor hand-eye coordination, well that short minute report will take about a few hours. No one likes to be sitting in front of a computer for a few hours. Everyone has friends and best friends that they talk to every day, But what happens if that friend moves out-of-town, out-of-state or possibility out-of-country? They might be forgotten or never seen from again. Well, thanks to technology and the advancement of computers, people can chat online on various platforms like instant messaging, myspace or facebook. They can catch upon things, check out what's new, even see posted pictures of them. The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away. Who wouldn't want to talk to friends or family that haven't been heard from? Lastly, having computer skills is very, very, very important in the real world. Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programer for the state, or they can create websites for their own jobs. Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or television shows. That's big money there. No wonder schools have computer classes. It's to get students to have a good background of the computer. Computers are not that bad. They teach hand-eye coordination, lets people talk to other people online and can get people great jobs. Many educated people would agree that computers does have a positive effect on people when used appropriately.
570	572	1	3	Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society. I for one, think that this is a terribly made thought. To begin, the internet (provided with most home desktop computers) can teach us a lot about the world around us. Additionally, the whole fact of contacting others around the globe, as well as having a whole fun world to explore, makes computers more enjoyable. Finally, thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers. Due to this, computers are , without a doubt, beneficial to society. The first reason I need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that can't be found anywhere else. While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world, anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly, beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like science and history, subsequently, people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges. Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in, online colleges are much rather cheap, affordable to anyone. Also, due to the high amounts of information online, schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year, though they complement traditional learning. Because of this, computers are definitely beneficial to society. To build up, the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely. Because of the growing population of those who use computers, companies tend to make computer shows, which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day. This makes television seem obsolete as well for some. Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday, allowing many things to be done by users. Software typically includes games, movies, and music for entertainment. Finally, since staying in touch with others is a good thing, chatting with others across the globe is very easy and durable, allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs. Due to this, computers can bring loads of fun to users, and are thus beneficial to society. Lastly, due to the rising demand of computers, companies typically rely on computers for jobs. Since the internet population is growing, companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company. Also, some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer. Many jobs these days, typically banks, rely on using the internet most of the time, and some actually are based in the internet. Because of this, workers can finish the job easily in one place, instead of having to around and going to a boring looking building to do a boring job. With this reason, why doesn't anyone else see why computers are beneficial to society? With all of these reasons, I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society. Education just become a whole lot easier thanks to the internet. If education is not what you seek, you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored. Finally, jobs can be completed even easier, and makes workers more responsible. So, leader of the paper, do you really, along with everyone else, think that computers are a waste of time in life? I believe the evidence shows they are a valuable tool.
571	573	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. All of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truly it is not. People who use their computers too much can have some harmful side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. The number one problem of the @LOCATION1 is obesity. It seems that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definitely taking part in the problem. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. This process continues until the certain person can barely get out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @CAPS2 eyes everyday. Computers are making this happen. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. When I go onto the computer for only @NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water. It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are damaging peoples health & @CAPS2 should be something done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the @LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullied all day in school and always had a horrible time. But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before kids are bullied a lot in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not any more. This new @ORGANIZATION2, video chat, @CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truly hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article and help raise awareness about these significant issues.
572	574	1	3	You must be insane! Computers are very important to society. My first reason is, computers can be used for research. Secondly, purchases can be made. Lastly, you can talk and video chat. These are my three reasons why computers are important to society. If you want to know more read on. Firstly, computers can be used for research. For example, what if your boss wants to find the price of products? All you have to do is go to www.google.com, and look it up! It is that easy. Also what if you need to do research on @ORGANIZATION1 for school? Instead of reading books about him, you can type in his name, and there's your information. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids/adults use the computer for research. This is my first reason. Secondly, purchases can be made. What if you would like to buy a plane ticket to @LOCATION1 to help? You can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience. You can order all types of supplies that are needed to @LOCATION1. Or purchase a gift that a relative/friend can have. How much simpler than going out and doing it yourself. This is my second reason. Lastly you can talk and video chat. You own a business with other people, and you all are in different countries and need to have a video meeting. What if you have relatives that live far away that you miss a lot? You can have a video call with your family. This is my last reason. I hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society and recognize their essential role in our daily lives.
573	575	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches them hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about people and places and allows for people to entertain themselves. As I said before computers are very useful for the advances of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very important in our current world because in order to play sports and type effectively you must have hand-eye coordination. When I was a boy of @NUM1 years I had very low hand-eye coordination skills and my playing suffered because of it. Now after a couple years of playing online my baseball, lacrosse and basketball skills have improved from playing online and practicing. Also my typing has gone up from @NUM2 words-per-minute to @NUM3 words-per-minute. Allowing me to write reports faster and allow more time for revision. But the internet also allows me to search the web to make the research aspect of my report go much faster. Throughout history people needed to support their opinions and arguments. Now the internet allows a person to search to find facts relating to their topic. This kind of help can make school projects easier, make students be even smarter and give opportunity to help those in need. As I got ready for my @NUM4 page position paper this year, I realized I needed @NUM1 sources. Usually this would be difficult but with the help of computers, research can be made a whole lot easier. Secondly, I learned so much during my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 class, like for example citizens don't really pick the president. The votes they give actually elect a representative to go to the @CAPS2 to cast a vote. Finally, after the earthquake in @LOCATION1 I was able to donate through the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 website. These examples show how important the internet is to learn about people and places, and maybe give a helping hand. Finally, the last great thing about the internet and computers is that you can entertain yourself through online games and movies. My mom is always telling me I should find ways to amuse myself without dragging her into playing catch with me; the internet and computers allow me to play online games by myself. Secondly, movies on computers can be a real time saver if you want to relax. These are the reasons why I believe computers are important for improving eye-hand coordination, learning about different people and places, and the ability to entertain yourself. Though my opinion will only count to myself I hope you will choose to stress the importance of computers in your future articles.
574	576	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I believe computers have made a great effect on people in society. I believe this because they make you smarter, they help with entertainment needs, they also give you the option to socialize with websites, and online chatting. These are things people need in every day life and here is how. One reason why I believe computers benefit people in society, is with the simple fact that computers teach you things. I mean sure you can pick up a book, but why? With a computer you can quickly, and easily type in what you need to know and within seconds you have @NUM1 million sites that can tell you what you need to know. Computers can also show you places that you've always wanted to see and learn about, the computer can tell you an exact location and information about the area. I know your thinking to yourself, ""wow how cool!!"" but that's nothing wait until you hear what else I have to say! Computers can give you instructions on how to build stuff, step by step instruction to create a work of art. My second reason is computers can give you entertainment like playing games, watching movies, and tv shows you missed because you were at work or doing something important. My last reason why computers benefit society is with socializing, you can make friends or chat with the ones you have, with websites like facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc. Making friends or keeping up with the ones you have in a positive way help fight depression. If your always happy on the computer then you'll have nothing to be depressed about. Also if you have any questions at all that you have wondering in your mind ask the computer and it will answer your questions thoroughly, and leave you satisfied with an answer. As you can see computers can do many great things, and what I said is only a few things computers are capable of; just watch, computers will be apart of our lives more and more and if you can't use one you @MONTH1 have a hard time. Please if you have a different opinion consider my decisions. Thank you for your time and for considering my point of view."
575	577	1	3	You say that computers are bad and does not help any one in these physical life but some people go on the computer to find yoga poses and diet tips and how does that not help them physically and mentally. Computers they @MONTH1 get kids in a lot of trouble they chat on (@CAPS1, facebook twitter, etc...) but they also don't know who's behind the computers they spend so much time on that @CAPS1 thing. That they don't pay attention to life itself. Now there are good parts about the computer you can find things you need and you can check travel sites etc... so you can not say that the computer is all that bad it helps a lot of people. So you should really be considerate about judging the skills of the computer they really do help in life. And they do help people that have physical needs by providing valuable information and resources for health and wellness.
576	578	1	3	Computers are something everyone uses, but there is a time when you should get off and start experiencing life. Computers do teach valuable hand-eye coordination, let you talk to friends and family, and give you the chance to learn about faraway places and people. But it also causes people to spend more time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting in person with friends and family. Exercise is a big thing in people's life; it keeps people in shape and healthy. A significant percentage of obesity is caused by excessive computer use, just staying on all day sitting down and eating. I think there should be a limit on computer use so people spend less time on the computer and more time exercising. Most people don't know what it does to them, but over time they get unhealthier and weaker. They don't realize that sitting down for hours and hours while eating a bag of chips takes a toll. Once they start doing it, it becomes a habit of eating and just going on the computer for hours on end. Not only does it decrease the time people spend exercising, it also decreases the time people spend enjoying nature and interacting with others. Computers are addicting; you go on for five minutes and you forget all about what you were doing, and before you know it you have spent many hours. When people go on the computers they forget all about other things they should be doing, like shopping or going out with friends and family. Enjoying nature and other simple pleasures are forgotten. It takes away your time that you could be using for going to the park, going to stores, visiting restaurants, and doing the things you love. Therefore, setting limits is essential for a balanced and healthy life.
577	579	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I believe that the use of the computer is a horrible thing for the people of the world. I think this because they don't exercise, enjoy the great outdoors, and have a good time with family and friends. When you are on the computer you are not exercising your body. This is a problem because this ""no exercising"" habit can stop a healthy lifestyle and a life span could be greatly shortened. Furthermore, this doesn't stop; more and more children will grow larger and not healthy. So the children care more about the internet than being healthy. One expert stated that a large percentage of children in school today are over a certain number of pounds in the middle grades, when it should be only an average of a much lower number of pounds or less. If the computer craze does not stop, kids will continue not to go outside and get to have some fun. Smart parents are wanting their children to have fun in the back yard. If children are inside and not outside, they will not get essential vitamins from the sun. The experts at a major health organization said that if the children do not stop going on computers then they will never see the true beauty of the outdoors. Clearly, you can see nature is something children need. Interacting with friends and family is also important for everyone. Because if one family member is having a health problem and has to go to the hospital, no one is there to be with them because they never talk to each other. One year I found out that my great grandmother died of cancer. I had no idea that she had cancer, and I wish I was at the hospital with her. But I wasn't because me and her never talked. Don't let that kind of thing happen to you; talk and have fun with your friends and family. So you can see that the use of computers is horrible because your life can end sooner, your children get fat, and you drift apart from your friends and family. So don't let this happen to anyone else. Tell everyone to value real-world connections over digital ones."
578	580	1	3	"What if your family is all online and you talk to them there? A large percent of people communicate online, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Here's the thing: are you for or against kids and parents being online for too long? I am all for this. Reasons being are that lots of kids have friends that they talk to online; secondly, kids have homework and projects that they might have to look up online; and my last reason for this is that some family might have members living far away, so they can communicate online. My first reason for this is that a lot of kids have friends online that they can't easily text or even talk on the phone with, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now? A representative from a parent organization said, ""I think the internet is a great thing; I mean I would rather have my kids online than outside roaming the streets and getting into trouble."" A significant number of kids are online communicating with others. Without a doubt, kids bring home projects and homework everyday, right? Wouldn't you rather your kid looking up information online than have them guessing and getting it wrong? I know that a lot of children don't have computers, internet access, or maybe they aren't allowed online. I remember the times when I had a project due at school, and I guessed on the information; that didn't do my grade any good. So then I decided the next time I have a project to do the research on the internet, and it worked. I got a much better grade then I did on the one I guessed on. Lastly, mostly everybody has family on the internet and would love to connect and talk with them while they are apart. So even if you stay online too often, you're not on it for a bad reason; you're on to talk to your family. One person shared, ""I got internet in my house, and I barely ever got to talk to my family before. But just then, my son convinced me to get online, and now I have the chance to talk to my family everyday."" Some people do say they are on the computer for too long at times and don't get out to exercise the amount a human should, or they don't get out of the house as much as they used to before they got the internet. Yes, but it's often for a good cause, and it's not like it will last forever. Also, it's being used for good, not for anything bad. I think the internet is a great thing, and it puts a positive effect on many people. Reasons are, kids have friends online to talk to, lots of schoolwork needs internet, and many people have family online to talk to. So it's now a matter of getting out there and making your best choice. The issue we grapple with is if you are for or against internet access! So get out there, and make a change now for balanced use."
579	581	1	3	Are computers benefiting society? I believe that computers are actually not benefiting society. In this article I will explain how you will receive less time exercising, less time with your family and friends, and less time enjoying nature just by being on your computers too much. If you are one of those people that love to be on the computer as much as you can, well, think of it this way. You spend so much time on the computer that you receive little or no exercise! Everyone needs to receive a little bit of exercise in order to stay fit and healthy. Our country's obesity level has gone up since our high-tech computers have come out. I believe that this is one of the main reasons for the rise in obesity. This is a major concern in our high-tech, computer society today. Besides you receiving less exercise, you will also receive less time with your family and friends. I understand you could talk to your family on Facebook, but you need interaction by talking face to face. This is one of our basic needs as an individual. Your family is going to be by your side no matter what, but you need to build a strong relationship with your family in order for them to be there for you. This is only going to happen if you interact face to face with them. The same thing goes for friends; this is another necessity for basic needs! Everyone should have some real-life relationship. Lastly, everyone needs to enjoy nature! It is a beautiful sight that everyone needs to experience. Being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do. The beauties of nature are amazing, but a large number of people don't take the opportunity to enjoy it. Being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive. You need to soak up the powerful rays of the sun and have a life-changing look around nature. But little of this will happen if you stay on your computer for many hours a day. In conclusion, computers are not benefiting society because people receive little or no exercise, less interaction with friends and family, and a lost chance to enjoy nature. Everyone needs to have these needs met instead of focusing all their time on the computer.
580	582	1	3	With the click of a mouse, you can access the internet. Computers and the internet are a recent innovation. You could probably find one in a common household today. They've improved and gotten popular within the last twenty years, and I believe they greatly benefit society. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate. Think about how life would be in the past without computers; it would be very different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources, such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic, and the computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books to find a single fact. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a standard document and print it; it's as easy as that. Another significant benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to a distant state due to jobs. Thanks to the internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them regularly. I'm sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, an instant messenger service, or a social media site, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convenient than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you in different time zones. If we didn't have this connection with foreign countries, everyone’s lives would be much more isolated. Computers haven't just changed personal lives; they have also revolutionized the medical field. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors can quickly find out about new discoveries and what advances have been taking place globally. Doctors now use computers to plan and perform complex surgery procedures with greater precision. Computers have helped advance and improve medical research and diagnosis, which in turn saves the lives of many people. A high percentage of tests that have taken place to research a disease use a computer of some sort to break down the data. The technology of computers has benefitted today’s society and has helped people achieve great things in many fields. It keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn in ways previously unimaginable. I hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today for the better.
581	583	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts about people staying on the computer too much. The reason why is family and friends can become distant, mood swings can occur, and also being overweight can become an issue. Finally, computers can do a lot of things @CAPS1 far. To be on the computer too much, your family will start to worry about you. If you were to stay on a computer for a whole day, that causes people to think otherwise of how you are. Also if you were to stay inside on a @DATE1 and your friends come over but you say, ""I don't wanna go out"", they are just drifting away slowly. Since I am a teen I stay up texting and talking and going outside and I hate to see one of my friend's on the computer when I wanna hang out. When I was @NUM1 or @NUM2, I used to always be on the computer for like days to weeks, until my friend's and family said don't let this get to you. I had a friend who was a good athlete and very funny and nice, but when his mom got him a computer, I didn't want to be his friend. When I was @NUM2 I used to get mad at everything if I couldn't use the computer, it was like I was a brat. Also I used to be big, (as in overweight) because I never went outside to exercise or in my own room. The reason being on why I stopped being his friend was he used to get mad if I came over there to ask if he could come outside. Also when he did come outside he used to never do nothing or run because he was always @CAPS1 tired. @CAPS1 what I am trying to say is the computer can really change people in a lot of bad way's. The last thing which makes everyone change is what computer's can do now. For example, a game called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 can get you addicted @CAPS1 fast, you barely do anything else. Another bad thing is @CAPS4, sure you keep in touch with friends but if you stay on too long, it's basically hooked you into it. Lastly online chatting room's or games when you can create a person to look like you makes you think that's gonna be your life from now on. Also people think that computer's can do anything it really can't, everything a computer can do is like a drug it's addicting. Well I just gave you a little thing of a lot of thing's a computer can do but to refresh your memory I'll say it again. A reason why I agree is family and friends seem distant to you at times you get mood swing's and less exercising, lastly what a computer could do now. Since you know now of the danger's that can happen I suggest you rethink about computers and consider a more balanced lifestyle."
582	584	1	3	Dear newspaper, I disagree with you about computers. I think that computers are helpful with projects, homework, or letters. For example you can use a computer to help you with projects, if you have a project to do and you don't feel like going to the library, you can use a computer to look up information on just about anything. And you don't have to draw pictures, that's what printers are for. Also when you have homework most kids or teenagers, even adults don't like doing homework, that's what a computer do for you can just look up the answer online and then your done in no time. Let's say you have to write a essay I know nobody likes to write essay's by hand you can type @CAPS1 and design @CAPS1 with your own designs and make @CAPS1 look nicer than you writing @CAPS1. Further more I know nobody likes to keep up with and if you lose @CAPS1 then you have to start over and that takes forever to do especially if @CAPS1's due the next day, you get bored and you don't feel like writing @CAPS1 over and you get mad because you already did @CAPS1. And when you had @CAPS1 in you mysteriously find you other paper that you finished and lost and @CAPS1 makes you so angry. And then you have to worry about if someone store @CAPS1 and copied @CAPS1 and put their name on the copied one but changed some of your ideas around so that they wouldn't lose major points and grade drops from a @CAPS2 to a @CAPS3 in no time flat. Lastly you can use a computer write finds of letters. You can write a that and people's report card's if your a teacher, and you can also write a letter to friend that mights have moved away. Therefore the types of letters you should be writing are love letters to yor wife or girlfriend at work or in school and @CAPS1 fast too instead of writing @CAPS1 and then you hards start to the worst kind of way. So instead you can write @CAPS1 fast and they get @CAPS1 fast if they have computer but if they work at a school then they can get because every school should have a computer so they'll be able to get @CAPS1. Another kind of letter you can write is a letter to your friend that you haven't seen in years or that has moved to another country or to another state so I hope now I have convinced you about why @CAPS1 is @CAPS4 to have a computer but as you sad @CAPS1 itsn't always @CAPS4 to be on the computer @NUM1 but once in a while @CAPS1 okay especially in an emergency if someone has just died in your family and you don't know how to get there use a gas, and if you don't have a gas go online and print out the directions so that you can get their and see which family member died and if you knew that so now that you know the importance of a computer. I hope you use @CAPS1 wisely and see the benefits it can provide.
583	585	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Computers! Computers! Computers! Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to disagree. In my opinion we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and exercising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not whats truely important! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are horrible. Pollution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people, because now these computers are brain washing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun. Their the more, computers have us sitting inside all day and not getting any exercise, which is a health issue we need to learn about the little things and be thankful for what we already have! Consiquently, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are loosing their ability to write card forgetting about the simple things life has to offer would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This @MONTH1 be old fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the @ORGANIZATION2 states would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time, writing on paper is like writing it in you brain. Therefore, students, children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and resonsibly. @PERSON1 is an english teacher that has been with the @ORGANIZATION1 school since before computers, she has seen the horrible effects taking place on her students right befor her eyes. @PERSON1 told me, ""@CAPS1, students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life, energy, or reativeness in them anymore! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time. Last, but most definetley not least is my third reason as to computers are effecting humans negetively. Humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most of people pay chedes are being used for their computers. These fancey computers are very expensive, but also very useless. In my opinion many people are just following a trend. Instead, the money can be spent on schools, and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending! To wrap it up, computers effect people. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all there money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very usefull,but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are and the harm they cause."
584	586	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, In my opion computers have a positive effect on people. The @CAPS1 allows people to communicat. People can learn bout things, places, even their own family. I also think that with a appropiate dosage it could help your body. If the @CAPS1 was never invented how would you talk to people from around the world. Mr. editor what if you were fourteen and had no friends. Well you could always go on myspace.com, facebook.com, or any other online community and make friends. Another thing that could happen is a family member or friend goes to another country for a vacaition and can't have long distance calls, you can talk to them on @CAPS2 or something like that. If your not really into using the @CAPS1 for communication you could learn. With the @CAPS1 you could learn a lot. You can even go to school online, but as I was saying you can learn about anything. One time when I had a project at school on fredrick douglas I used the @CAPS1 for help. I learned bout his family, his childhood, were he's from, and lots of other important facts. The @CAPS1 can be a good search enging but don't stay for to long your body needs you too. I think think the @CAPS1 better can your health. People always say if stay on the computer you get fat and unhealthy, but I don't think that. First being on a computer using the mouse is helping your hand-eye coordination. you can also look at diet plans, find medicine for your health, or find new ways to exercise your body. So thats why I think the @CAPS1 can help your body. All of these reason is why I think the @CAPS1 has good effects on people and is a valuable tool when used responsibly.
585	587	1	3	More and more people use computers in fact about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T has computers, everyone uses them. I think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing, jobs, and schoolwork. This is why I think having a computer is a good things what do you think? As I was say computers are good for emailing, even I.ming. lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is. You can just push that power button and tree to your coach asking what time you need to be at the feild. Also theres I.Ming, its wen you can talk to your friends online its a great way to comunicate and meet new people. Emailing is great, its so hi-tect you can email one of your family members who live thousand miles away from you. I once did that my aunt's lisa was in florida and i asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches and she did, they were eye catching. Next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs. In todays world everything is ran by computers for example each registers. A.T.M. and car are ran off of computers. So having it for a job is great. Lets your tells you to fax over a copy can do it the computer within a minute i know my dads job requires of he keeps it all to his witch on his desktop on his laptop. This is why most jobs have computers. Do you are one? Lastly, school was computers . For example my teacher on his computer atendence, homework and . If he didn't have that, he would be lost. Its also good for the kids too. Every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that. Did you know is a program were you can look at your grades and missing assignments? It's call power school. Computers are great for school. I think every one should have one. So what do you think about them? Are they amazing or what? I think are very helpful because you can use them for emailing, working, and school work. If it wasn't for computers we would really know as much as we do now. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T have them. Computers are gonna help you through life alot, welcome to the real world and all the opportunities they provide.
586	588	1	3	"Dear the newspaper, Computers are great resources and are helpful in many ways. Since we have the technology, why not use it? Computers give us simple yet very useful programs like Microsoft Word or Photoshop, outstanding abilities to look up any information you want, and keep in touch with far away relatives using Facebook or video chats like Skype. Wouldn't it be terrible if you were just about to finish an essay for school when you misspelled a word and had to start all over?! Well this is what happened frequently when computers weren't around and you had to use a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter, computers have programs such as Microsoft Word, where if you make a simple mistake, all you have to do is press backspace. With programs like this, essays and flyers are extremely easy to make. There are also a lot of other programs like PowerPoint, Photoshop, or video-editing software. These are real time-savers. You can just put your camera chip into your computer and ""voilà,"" instant editing. Programs that you can download make life a whole lot simpler and save you a lot of time. Along with the programs to write a paper, you can use the internet and Google to get the information! All you have to do is type in a short phrase and instantly get thousands of sites, all packed with information. And instead of spending ten minutes in a dictionary, you can find a definition in a split second on dictionary.com. I took a tally and nine out of every ten kids use the internet at least once a day! Let's say you had a party coming up, but had nothing creative to cook for food. Just type in ""creative foods for a party"" and you will easily have hundreds of new recipes to choose from. The internet is an extraordinary invention that is very simple and helpful to use. Another fantastic thing to use on a computer is social connections such as MySpace, Facebook, or Skype. This is a great way to catch up with old friends from high school or college, or plan a big event while being relaxed at home. If you had soccer practice at night so you couldn't hang out with friends, but still had time to do a quick chat, this is perfect. Skype and other video chats are amazing. They are very convenient when you need to speak with someone all the way in Australia for business and don't want to travel. All you have to do is open a link and ""bam,"" they're right there! These are great for businesses and long distance relationships. I have an uncle and aunt who live in England and we use Skype to keep in touch. It's a fantastic way to communicate across the globe. Computers sometimes make us ""look"" lazy, but they give us a lot. The time saved from their convenience can be used to run around and get exercise. Computers have amazing programs that help us in all ways, internet for quick information, and social connections to keep in touch with family, friends and businesses. Computers are one of the most convenient things we have and I strongly suggest you would agree with me."
587	589	1	3	Dear Editor, I believe that going on the computer has a positive effect on people. It is also true that some people are not getting enough exercise. To prevent not getting enough exercise we should play sports or have family activities to at least get out of our house. Everybody needs to stop being lazy and get active. I think that an exercise day should be made and turned into a tradition. It could be twice a year or more a month or whatever is picked as long as there is one day where everyone or even more than everyone can exercise on. This day could involve community walks, local sports tournaments, or simply a dedicated time for families to be active together outdoors. By establishing such a routine, we can enjoy the benefits of computers while also maintaining our physical health and well-being, creating a more balanced lifestyle for all.
588	590	1	3	I use the computer all the time and I'm healthy. Just because you use a computer more than getting exercise doesn’t mean you're not healthy. I think computers help a lot in life. Now I will talk about some of the things that computers help out with in life. Computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to know. It will even help you, if you have a job and don't know what time to go in or waste. Computers are also fun. You can go to different websites and play any games. You can also talk to people on them. Or get email which is like getting real mail but from a computer. But there can be some issues. People are using them too much. They need to get more exercise. So that's what I think of computers; hopefully people will get more exercise now and find a good balance between their screen time and physical activity for a healthier life.
589	591	1	3	Dear Editor, Many people in the world use computers, we all know what computers are used for like searching the internet, playing games, and for work and school. Some people think that computers are good to use to help teach hand-eye coordination, learn about other places in the world and talk with other people online. I am in seventh grade at Mystic Middle School. I think that computers are not as good as some people think. Have you ever heard of computer camps? This is where some kids go because they are addicted to the computer. At this camp the kids are pulled away from the computer and pretty much forced to join groups that do activities like fishing or working together to solve a mystery. This camp is pretty much known as reliable for kids that are addicted to the computer. Another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet. The internet is a very dangerous place because you can chat with people that you don't even know. You never know, the people could be messed up in the head and try to find out where you live and come get you, so you always have to be careful who you talk to otherwise you could get hurt. Nothing ever really goes right with computers; they're always getting slower and slower every time you use it. About every two years a kid or parent could go through a computer. Also, if your computer doesn't have the right protection it could get a virus and cost a person a few hundred dollars to get it fixed. Anything could happen at any time with your computer; out of nowhere it could just die and not work and all of your data will be gone forever. Now that I have explained my part about computers, people will think differently. Would you want to end up like one of those people that are in a camp because they are on the computer too much? Or you never know, you could disappear forever and never be found. I already know how much it is for computers to get fixed, but you might have to find out the hard way. That is why I think that computers just cause more trouble for people than they are worth.
590	592	1	3	Do you honestly believe that Computers don't benefit society? Well, they do. Computers help you re-connect with people. They offer a fabulous search engine and let you watch videos. Computers are growing into the human lifestyle. Computers help you re-connect with people. My mom uses Facebook and she found friends she hasn't seen since the early 90's! It's a great tool to talk to your friends in your daily life. Also, you can video chat using your webcam to actually see them. Therefore computers benefit society. Computers also have the best search engines. Doing research for a paper on Brazil? Google and Wikipedia are all you need, basically giving you all the material for an A. If your newspaper hasn't come yet, the internet has the times and more! The only place to get millions of songs free for your iPod or phone is on the computer. It's one of the greatest electronics invented. The amazing computer also allows you to watch videos on the internet. You want to have a real good laugh? Well YouTube is where you should go. To learn about history, today's lifestyle and more, it's a great resource. If you want, you yourself can upload videos too! A great site, great computers, benefits society. After my essay I can honestly say computers benefit society. Computers help re-connect with people, have a fabulous search engine, and let you watch videos. Computers are growing daily, helping the user get the most satisfaction. They do help us in countless ways.
591	593	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers take away from our lives in a negative way. New advancements in technology in general take away from our lives negatively. It can contribute to obesity, turn you into a couch potato, and can take away from your social life. It's not that computers arent useful, it's that people are using them too frequently. As a country, @LOCATION1 has more obese people each decade, a trend that is concerning for public health. A good way to lessen the obese population, is to get them out of that computer chair and encourage physical activity. @CAPS5 all you do is sit on a chair and play flash games and watch youtube videos all day, your sure to put on a few pounds, Those few pounds do accumulate over time, leading to significant weight gain. @CAPS6 fast food companies like @ORGANIZATION1 contribute to obesity, so do computers. When someone eats a big mac burger, should they go upstairs to play a flash game, or go work out at the gym? Trust me, you arent going to burn any calories by clicking a mouse. People who often use the computer, rarely see the true beauty of nature. They are too busy shooting animated rabbits to go see real rabbits. Would you rather take a walk in the park, or stare at a computer screen for @DATE1 and a half hours? The world is a beautiful place, and the more you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the less you realize it. Being on the computer can even effect your social life. The more you socialize to people you don'@CAPS4 know on the computer, the less you know how to communicate to real people I know that I would want a real girlfriend, not a virtual one. You @MONTH1 be too into a @CAPS4.V. show that your watching on the computer, to even spend time with loved ones. Your family is much more important than a silly computer game. In conclusion, I'd like to say that (in my opinion) computers should be used a little less. Who wouldn'@CAPS4 want to be a fit, nature loving, popular kid @CAPS5 people would just spend a little less time on the computer, and a little more time in reality, You could be a kid like that. (@CAPS6 I'm sure the @CAPS1 is an adult.).
592	594	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think spending to much time on a computer is bad. One of my reasons are Exercising. People should be outside jogging or working out and enjoying nature, breathing fresh air and feeling the sunshine. Also should be socializing with friend, sharing laughs and creating memories together. Now my second reason is spending time with your fromily. Being with your family is important because their fun go out with, whether it's for a meal or a day trip. Also they're good to socialize with at home or any other place, providing support and companionship. Sometimes socializing with people on a computer is not good as if with people because socialicing with friends and family is easier than sitting on a chair typing a bunch of works explaining about the convosation your having, which can feel impersonal and distant. And last my finall reason is being active. People should be active because it's fun and your socialicing with people and playing sports with or friends. It keeps you fit and healthy, improving your overall well-being. Also being active can healthen your lungs and heart, making you stronger. For example football keeps your legs strong and built. And basketball keeps you quick and always running. It's good for you because being active gives you a healthier, stronger and in shape body. So their for I think spending a lot of time on a computer is bad for your physical and social health.
593	595	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 be true that computers @MONTH1 make people exercise less, enjoy nature less, and spend time with family and friends less but computers do benefit the society in many ways. Computers help students with homework and projects and they help communicate with other people. Besides the telephone, computers do have some bad things about them, too. Students need computers to help them complete homework and class projects efficiently. They help students create good presentations and students can use the internet for research, accessing a vast amount of information quickly. Having computers will help raise a students grades and help them have a more successful life in the future by providing essential skills. Parents and kids can communicate long-distance friends and/or relatives and they can talk to co-workers, bosses, teachers of their kids, and with their own children/parents, too, which strengthens relationships. Having computers would create more communication with some people and help keep in touch with family members who live far away. Besides all of the good things, computers do have bad qualities, too. They can lead to children seeing inapropriate sites, and maybe even a virus that crashes your computer! Most of the programs to get rid of viruses block children and adults from seeing inapropriate sites (like gambling, pornography, etc). We need a computer that is pre-installed with the best up-to-date virus protection system, that helps protect children, teens, and adults from viruses, inapropriate sites, and cyber-bullies. Having these will make a computer almost perfect! The computers everyone needs should help students learn, keep raising communication between people and be pre-uploaded with programs to protect people from viruses, bad websites, and cyber-bullies. Computers are needed, and without them, our lives would be extremely miserable and disconnected in today's world.
594	596	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think people need to see the realatey from computer's and the real world, they're a lot of people spending to much time on the computer and not spending enough time with there familys or doing things that are really important. While your on the computer your not getting any exsercise your not getting stronger your just sitting down, which is not good for your body. Thats one of the ways people get fat because there not moveing around just sitting down, leading to weight gain and health issues. When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on, like conversations and shared experiences. I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter in your life! But you really can't tell people how long there allowed to spend on the computer you can only give an opinon and hope they listen and make a positive change for themselves.
595	597	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Technology is really a fascinating thing in life is it? Take a computer for example, they can check information online, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow people to communicate. This absolutely benefits society. Well, it makes life a lot easier and faster for people. Don't you agree? Do you ever forget what your homework was or what time does something start and end? Well you can always checks information online, @CAPS3 you ever forget! So there, you can be on task and get ready early. For example, you need to know what time a movie starts at the movie theatre so you check online! Also, you can forget the steps of how to do something on your project or homework, so you check online! So whenever a student forgets, he can check online instead of coming tomorrow to school and saying, ""@CAPS1 I didn't know what to do,"" or, ""@CAPS1, I forgot how to do it."" @CAPS2 you ever wanna travel to places but you knew nothing about the place? Or how much would it cost? Or have you ever wanted to learn about a famous person, for example, @PERSON1? Instead of going to the library and reading through all these books to learn something, you can just go online! There are millions and millions of websites about places and people. Therefore, it makes it much easier to learn about a certain place, person or thing. The computer can be really helpful and useful. Plus, you can plan vacation, to a place and be sure you will have enough money by checking the price online! So you won't have to worry that you wont have enough money when you got there. @CAPS2 you ever want to communicate with your friends all day long without wasting minutes? In fact, you can communicate with multiple friends on the computer. For example, chat rooms can reach up to hundreds of people. Therefore, you won't have as much trouble trying to communicate to all your friends at a time on the computer than on the phone. Also, you communicate with people around the world. This includes your family members or relatives etc. @CAPS3 they live on the other side of the @LOCATION1. Plus, @CAPS3 you have not seen them for awhile or haven't talked to them, you can webcam or video chat with each other, making the distance feel smaller. Keeping in contact with important people or your friends is a good thing for maintaining strong bonds. The effects that computers have on people are really something you should thank god for. You can check information about something @CAPS3 you ever forget. You have the ability to learn about people and places easily and you can communicate with your family and friends, making the world a more connected place."
596	598	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, do you ever just wanna go outside and play a game of football with the ones you love? Well I know I do. I believe that almost @PERCENT1 of kids are on the computer for @NUM1 hours because they have nothing else to do or it is addicting. The reason that I believe in this strongly true statement is that people are concerned about how much time people spend on the computer and not with their families. One important fact about kids being on the computer is how dangerous it can be. Nowadays kids don't realize how dangerous being online can be; for example, I remember a time when my cousin said that he went to the movies to meet up with some girl he met on Myspace but all he saw was a balded headed sex offender. That man told him he was the one talking to him online and that he wanted my cousin to go over his house and play X-box. My cousin screamed ""hell no"" and left to my house because the movie theater was closer to my house. Knowing how to be safe is important. Would you rather have your children safe with you or with some stranger? Computers can also be helpful at times when needed for school or your job. Only some people would think its fun to go home and go on the computer for no reason. Secondly, don't you want to spend time with your children before they go to college or something? Just the littlest thing like playing a game of football will affect them to create a better bond with you and your child. Something you can do to get them to go outside with you is take the computer away for a week and have fun with your child. Play some of his or her favorite sports. So with the computer, you risk life without a bond with your child. So the time has come to make a choice: let your kid be lazy on the computer and get into trouble, or go have fun with them?"
597	599	1	3	"There has been a debate whether computers benefit society or hurt society. I personally agree with the statement that computers benefit society. I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accurately you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remember as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her years of practice, she became very computer coordinated. My own hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have typed for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 of people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated; typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greatest hand-eye coordination practice ever."" Another plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places without really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer. People can look up information on countries for pleasure too. My mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schools too. My older sister went online to look at colleges without actually traveling to the actual college states. Finally, one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write to people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to immediately talk to somebody and for them to immediately talk to you back. I remember I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said ""video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right in front of them talking with them."" These reasons are why I think computers are a big help in our society."
598	600	1	3	Dear People of the Newspaper, I think that computers are good in some ways, like to look something up about the other side of the world. Like if you have to do a paper on the other side of the world, a computer is up to date unlike a book, so computers have a good effect on school kids and work. So computers are good, but other than that most people spend all day talking to people on them and don't go outside and get fresh air. So computers have bad effects on some people and have good effects they all need for work and stuff. I think that most people use computers too much to talk to people and for gaming. But some people don't go on it for a long time and go outside and use a computer if they have to for work. So the effects of computers is that too many people use them forever, talking to people and sitting and getting fat from not going outside and playing and getting fresh air. So most people overuse their computer on Facebook and stuff like that, where they could go outside and sit on a swing and text and get fresh air instead.
599	601	1	3	Technology is advancing every day. One main technological device that is popular is the computer. More and more people are using them, however, not everyone agrees that it benefits society. I believe that it does benefit us. One reason is that you can explore things at home. Before computers you would have to go to the library, find the book you need, and then search through it until you found the information you needed. Those things alone could take hours, especially if you don't live near a library. However, with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what you're looking for. That could save you gas money because you don't have to drive anywhere. Another reason is that you can communicate online for free. Without a computer you would either have to go see that person by driving, talking on the phone, or texting, which are all expensive. On the computer you have e-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many more. All of them allow you to communicate in different ways. If you want to look at pictures, take quizzes, play games, or talk, that's @CAPS2. And finally for e-mail, you can send people letters and videos, or you can just talk to other people by typing like all the others. This convenience and cost-saving aspect makes computers a clear benefit to modern society.
600	602	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, you should know that computers are very helpful machines. Computers supply people with online education, improve hand-eye coordination and creativity, and are one of the main ways to communicate. To begin, computers supply a large amount of people with educational opportunities. On the computer you can learn anything. In fact my cousin @PERSON2 earned his degree in accounting through an online college. @PERSON2 now has a well-paying job in accounting. Without the computer people would not be where they are in life right now. Not to mention, just last @DATE1 I was assigned to complete a history paper on @LOCATION2. All I had to do was do around an hour's amount of research on @LOCATION2's culture and history. I received an A on my paper. Computers are very helpful in helping people learn. Which brings me to my next point, computers teach you skills. The computer has many different applications and tools. The computer integration is sophisticated, not only letting you be creative in your own way but giving you better hand-eye coordination. Many people are known for their creativity and they benefit from using a computer. Recently, @CAPS4 have shown that @PERCENT1 of people say the computer is a primary way to communicate without physical contact. Ultimately, the computer is not such a bad thing, supplying education, boosting creativity and hand-eye coordination, and is also a main way of communication. So @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 editors, writers, and readers should recognize that computers are helpful machines, and more people are missing out on using a computer to its full potential.
601	603	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are high tech devises that allow us to connect with friends and family in other places like france or @LOCATION2, allow us to research new information, perhaps for a school project in school and even play addicting games, Computers have moderized our life, and it's affect on human being is dispicable. We have taken these simple devices to far and haven't used them in moderation. Did you know that at least an hour @MONEY1 exercise is needed everyday? Well @CAPS3 from all over the world are not getting enough exercise because @MONEY1 computers. Parents hard earned money is being wasted away on these extremely expensive computers, they can pay anywhere from @NUM1! What a waist @MONEY1 money! @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 kidnappings are caused because @MONEY1 to much information on the internet, do you want that for your child. Computers were once helpful devices that have now turned in to @CAPS4 worping machines. @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the world's @CAPS3 are obese today. Why are they abese you ask? @CAPS3 are growing fast they are meant in be active and playful and without any active sport like dancing nor basketball they are going to grow big. Kid's spend as much a @NUM2 hours a day on a @CAPS2, and not keeping active, @CAPS2 pull kid's in like a magnet. This obsessive @CAPS2 time leaves no time to keep healthy active and fit. I remember one time when one @MONEY1 my friends, @PERSON1 got a new computerShe wouldn't come out and play basketball with us anymore she just stayed inside. Eventually saly became obese and got diabetes. Parents is this what you want for your @CAPS3? Do you want to pay for a machine that makes your @CAPS3 extremley whealthy? Times are tough, money is tight and electronics are expensive. A @CAPS2 can cost anywhere from @MONEY4 TO EVEN @MONEY3 that is a ton @MONEY1 money. Parents work hard hours, for exampe @NUM3 that is a long day and probably dont make enough money to be waisting it on a @CAPS2. An average houshold spends @MONEY2 on computers in a lifetime. Do you really want to be buying your @CAPS3 a machine that costs an outragous amount @MONEY1 money that will only make your @CAPS3 unhealthy and pull them away from their sports? I remember when my mom bught me a new @CAPS2 for @NUM4 dolllars and the next day it broke. What a waist @MONEY1 money. Help your @CAPS3, don't buy a @NUM2,000 dollar @CAPS2, keep your @CAPS3 active and healthy. Make sure your green stays in your wallet. Hey, a small window pops up you screen. Who are you, you respond in an voice, @CAPS7, your freind @CAPS8's friend says the little window. You respond with an @CAPS7 hi, hey you want to come over, it's the cook thing, @CAPS9 ok you respond. What's wrong with this situation? Well a lot @MONEY1 things are but this happens to @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 online chatters. Just remember online you can be whoever you wont to be you could be only ten, but say your @NUM6. So many @CAPS3 are kidnapped because @MONEY1 online chatting. You can talk to your @CAPS3 all. you want but it doesn't mean thy won't be in that situation. The less time your child spends on the @CAPS2 the less chance will have @MONEY1 being kidnapped, The @CAPS2 is so dangerous, would you ever put your child in danger. Computers used to be helpful devices full @MONEY1 information, enjoyment and talks with aunt's uncles, and even your friend @PERSON2. Now these computers have transformed into pursuading boxes full @MONEY1 hamful side affects. Do you want your child feeling the wind in their ears the sound @MONEY1 their heart pumping vigurously and the smell @MONEY1 grass on do you want them to experience the bright screen in their eyes and the thrill @MONEY1 just beating level @NUM7? Do you want to spend @MONEY1 on unhealthy contraptions? and lastly do you want your @CAPS3 put in danger by simply just using a @CAPS2 at home. Computers are @CAPS4 morphing devices that take away @CAPS3's points in life. Do you want thet for them.
602	604	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 are many reasons why the computer technoligy benefits the society. For starters, the newspaper companies use computers to write the @ORGANIZATION2 paper. Personally, I believe that computers benefit the society for many reasons. Computers help with education, career building, and helps people connect with family. By readin this letter, I hope that this make computers appealing to you. One reason why people benefit from computers is how they help with education. In a poll taken at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the students say that computers hel htem with their academic career. Also, many adults use computers for an education too. In the student body in class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year. @PERCENT2 of those students finished their high school and college years through online classes. Another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers. At @CAPS3 industries, @PERSON1, the @CAPS4, says,  I dont know where our business would be if we didn't use computers. "" @CAPS5 to a poll taken by @CAPS4's of many high ranning industries, @PERCENT3 said that their business revolves around the internet. this could very well be the poll your @CAPS4 took. Finally, computers help families that are seperated, connect with each other. A marine said that he tries to contact his family as much as he can while he is at sea. If anyone deserves to contact their family that they haven't seen in two years, it should deffinately be the people in the army. In conclusion, the computer technoligy has benefited many people. A system that could regulate peoples computer use could be implamented but it would not make anybody happy. The changes could be made but, if anyone tried to take something important away, would you not do anything to stop it?"
603	605	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that if you allow you self to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes a day at the most that will allow you plenty of time to go outside & excersize. Useing the @CAPS5 is fine in moderation, but if you are constantly on the @CAPS5 it can't be healthy @CAPS2 You (unless its your job) you should only be on the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes to an hour a day! So me people are on the @CAPS5 so much that they re eyes get worse & worse, Not only does it affect your physical health but it take hurts your physical @CAPS3 are some stories of blood shut eye, pink eye, or even @CAPS4 this is a very serious issue the people who are like this are called @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 to @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 over @PERCENT1 of people say they know or are someone who is a @CAPS5 addict, and scientists say in the next year that number will double or even triple. I know that people need to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 things such as email, projects, Ideas, or even models but really does anybody read a book anymore! We must remember to balance our screen time with other healthy activities for our own well-being.
604	606	1	3	Dear newspaper, In my opinion, I believe that kids and adults spend more than enough the on their computers I can see how it benefits you in some ways but it keeps you away from halwe, being outdoors and excersizing. It also can have an effect on your eyes in your later life. People go on @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 search engines and a little more than half those site's results are fuke. And the more people go on computers, the easier it is to yet caught pladurizing and that is a big thing in the community. Those are some ideas, but I have some more don't worry and details to go along with those ideas. People need fresh air, excersize for their body and to enjoy the outdoors. You can do all of that stuff if you just get off the computer. And instead of searching the places online and what their all about, just go visit them. You will get fresh air, excersize and experience. And after having that experience you will pass it on, teh real to ohter people will not get any of hot fake stuff. For example, you can search @CAPS2 online and they just have pictures food. But if you take visit there you will get to really last the food. Would you rather being sitting in a chair, staring at the computer, or having fun outdoors visiting places you have never seen before? You will never get or learn anything by pudurizing plus you will get than and get clicked. But if you think a little or maybe had experience with your writing tool, then you will learn and. That is also because kids are too lazy to it out because they are not outside doing things and they're inside and used to they becausethey are so their computer all the time. I guest I also agree with using computers because they give you skills they going to places don't give you. Like, you also need skills, mainley, hand-eye coordination for typing the long papers for collage and those skills will get you for in life. It's like a chain reaction, you type on the computer a lot, you will have good hand-eye coordination if you have good hand-eye coordination, you will do good in school, and it goes on. And you end up being successful. Another benefit with computers is the sales, more and more people are buying computers which helps the economy so I guess I agree but my opinion will stay strong with not using computers. So wether you have a computer or not, if you dont I prefer not to get one, but get off your bum and do some excersizing and visit those topical islands you always visit in person for a real adventure.
605	607	1	3	Dear newspaper, I read an article in the newspaper that said how people on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit. I actually think itís a good idea about people being on their computers. I have a few reasons why this is a good thing. Whenever a student needs information on a certain topic, then they use the internet for help. Research is helpful because there could be a lot of sites on-line that could give you what you need. The topics typed into search engines will help find any information help to you. Whenever a teacher @MONTH1 need an assignment typed, you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day. You can also find interesting pictures on what you're learning about. Sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into. It would sometimes be a good idea not to search for something all night, or someones going to be mad at the electricity bill. Also, it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake. Using the internet doesn't need to be for work only. People use computers to shop on-line, check times for movies, and talk with friends. People talking to friends on-line is good because they @MONTH1 not be able to talk however they want in school, and you @MONTH1 not get to see them on the weekends. Teens who talk on-line usually talk with their best friends. If one friend on a group of friends probablly in the same town as you, then they could talk by using their laptops they bring anywhere. Then you could probably hear about something that you (and your friends) have in common which @MONTH1 be coming somewhere that's by where you live. So being on the computer to talk with friends isn't so bad. Students who are young, usually get to learn to type. This could help them in the future if you need to type up an assignment for school, a job application, or college application. Learning to type is good because you also get to see which keys are where and wont need to look at them alot. Soon, you would be able to type a certain amount of words in a short amount of time. This @MONTH1 also be help with reading and understanding big words. In conclusion, I think, computers don't hace too much of an effect on people. As long as they'er not on there for more than two hours, then they're fine. Using the computer seems to have more advantages than disadvantages for learning and connecting with others.
606	608	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 my name is @CAPS2, @PERSON1 and I think that this idea based on why people need computer is a good statement/ @CAPS3. My @CAPS4 opinion is that some say people use their computers so much they don’t exercise, but when that is not true do to the fact that computers have programs on how to watch your weight, stocks, and etc. Also Technology helps people around the world on websites, programs such names as to video chat, @CAPS5.com for instant messaging. On the way teen stuff like computers help people for on video chatting, emailing people their resumes to jobs on why and how their based, on showing people their recent jobs, and giving details. On showing people reading this article is that technology of computers also help @CAPS6 save. Most reasons we need tech equipment is that people use it on fields such as the navy, @CAPS6, dealerships, all over the world industry. Why is that good well my point of view is that business need that to order their stocks for store carriers and more. For @CAPS6 on field to use for @CAPS7 scan, pregnancy, pulse radar's and more. And on the negative point of those side of the readers are based on the mostly that people get addict to technology when the truth is that people really need technology look around you and everything in this world has mostly been made by technology and the @CAPS8 is that people should agree that computers help people, speak, @CAPS9, email, lives, help find family, friends, give directions, so on my point of view @CAPS9 tell your dean @CAPS1 and readers that interacting with technology is a good way to control ways on how or what you do in the computers do to that in my way I make sites audio and interesting Technology can allows people on ways to help people find and create ways to making money or interesting positive out comes out of using person in this world goes in and thru out tech equip these days, and to the people who have read this article should pass this story on to people who take technology on negative terms and to help them think about it positive. We should all recognize the essential role computers play in our daily lives and work.
607	609	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are a good effect in our lives. Some of the reasons why I say this is they are good to use when researching, have fun games and activities, and they keep you in touch with long distant relatives. First if you just been given a assignment for school or work you @MONTH1 have to type and research on what ever topic a computer is a great source of knowledge if researching something or even checking your bills, @CAPS1, it makes these tasks much simpler. Computers are fun they have lots of games and activities for you to play and do. Just think you sitting in the house on a rainy day bored out you mind and have no thing to do. Just go on your computer and play some game or just find some activities you whole family could do together. Lastly, Computers are good to stay in contact with long distant family members these days all you have to do is get a web cam and hook it up to your computer and now its they our grandma, grandpa, cousin, and uncle, or who ever is right there you can talk to them like you were on the phone with no cost, seeing their faces and sharing moments. In conclusion, as you can see after all I wrote computers, are good for researching, playing games or doing activities, and staying in touch with family I @CAPS2 in my house the computer is mostly used for the web cam to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. Well I hope this letter changed you opinion on this great invention, the computer, and how it positively connects and assists us.
608	610	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 people think that computers are good for society but I do not. Computer's risks out weighs the benefits. My first example is my father. My father never turned on a computer in his life and his business is doing fine. My father and his father has all of their records in a safe. One of my fathers friends had everything on his computer. When a virus hit it all of his files were gone and along with his records, causing him great trouble. My father handwrites all of his papers. He says if i need to type something out i'll buy a type writer. Also on things like facebook someone can see everything that another is doing. This is were a lot of people pose as someone else and thus @CAPS2 people get kidnapped or killed. A very good reason is that when people have a lot of personal information when a virus hits that person knows everything about you that you put on. For example i was watching a show on discovery channel when a man hacked into a myspace account and used that persons name to people and try to create a cyber to the pentagon, that person almost got caught but never was. So you can see why my family does not like computers. My family is always at the farm or in the barn working on we have no time to be on the internet the only thing you need it for is school work. What ever happened to the old fashion way no computer, no problems, where life was simpler and safer for everyone involved.
609	611	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have @NUM1 reasons why computers effects have on people. First, computers are not good for your eyes. Second, the reason why people get on computers a lot. Third, there are so much games and places to go like myspace, facebook and even twitter and much more. Keep on reading so I could tell you all about my three reasons. First of all, computers are not good for your eyes because computers are like @CAPS3's is the something but not really because computer as more information and @CAPS3 dont really got so much information you could browse for, leading to more screen time. My second reason is that the more people be on computers the more blind they could get just for being on the computers for a hour or more, straining their vision. Third, some people dont even dare if they be on computer they wont they might think that just because they wear gasses they wont get blinder but they are wrong they will get more blinder. As you reading you will find out my second reason for being to much in the computer. My second reason, is that why people get in computers a lot well people get on computers just to their or do their taxes but that is not good because just because your doing your bills or your taxes you to a lot of information that people in other countries or state could get without you knowing, which is a risk. Second is that people or get on computers to pay their bills or do their taxes they also get on the computer to maybe order something or buy a ticket to fly to a place they want to go like a vacation place or a business trip. my third reason is that they not only buy or order things but thet get in websites that will make their lives better like meeting somebody special or something else, which can be dangerous. As you keep reading you will find out my third reason for being to much and so long in the computers. My third reason, is that their are a lot of activities to do in the computer for a example myspace, facebook and twitter are the most popular website that people get in just to meet new people and talk to old friends, which can lead to sharing too much. In conclusion, people should not be on computer too much because of their health and their privacy and also to be sure not to meet strange people, ensuring their own safety and well-being in the long run.
610	612	1	3	In our society computers have a big role. Some people think that this enhances our society and benefits the people in the @LOCATION1. Other people think computers are hurting the @CAPS1 citizens. I believe that computers can have our society into the next and can enhance use to people. Computers can benefit people by tracking hand-eye coordination give people the ability to learn about the world, and allow people to communicate to others. Computers can teach hand-eye coordination which helps people work with their hands. An argument on the of this is that computers take the place of exercise. For a lot of @CAPS2 a sport is their exercise and in every sport you need hand-eye coordination. Computers don't take the place of they enhance the persons ability to play for example to be a goaly in any sport you need fast mentions and good hand-eye coordination. A computer can help the save more goals by increasing their hand-eye coordination. Having good hand-eye coordination can also save you life. If a knife was you human nature world tell you to cover your head with your hands. This would you, if you had hand-eye coordination you away with your body to avoid the knife, making you safer. Computers help you physically but they can help you mentally as well. Computers can take you around the world without leaving your room. Computers can teach go about culture and life that you didn't even know existed. The cahan @CAPS1 can not afford the luxury of seeing the world first hand, computers let those people see the world from different points of view. If a student needed to know all about one country they could go on the internet and get a tour. A student could not go to the country so they went to the second base thing the computer. They can the wanted with one click, accessing vast information. Family, friend and colleagues are all people you need to talk to. Computers made communication easy for anyone. Now you can talk and see a person in video chat. This benefits society because if you are talking to a business partner you can point to graphs and charts you made. You can also to see a love one that you miss, making distances feel smaller. Their is a different type of communication for every person. You can e-mail, @CAPS4, instant message, etc. Communication connects people around the world it a small world after all. Computers have taken our society in the next level. People can travel the world in a second, talk to anyone and have hand-eye coordination. Computers are growing @LOCATION2 keeping is on top. What would you choose for a better, more connected future?
611	613	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are using technology extensively in their daily lives. A lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability, while others disagree. I personally feel that computers are an advantage but also a disadvantage. I say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning in their classrooms. I say it is a disadvantage because a lot of people are on the computer for many hours and they don't get a lot of exercise or physical activity. There are pros and cons to computers but manly cons. How long do you stay on the computer each day? @CAPS2 people find computers more entertaing than going outside and getting some exercise or fresh air. Since technology is advancing rapidly, more and more people are going out to buy computers and other devices. A lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer, playing games and going on their favorite websites like social media. That is one reason why children from the ages @NUM1 and up are obese and overweight. They don't get enough exercise or participate in sports. That also leads into people not spending quality time with your friends and family members. I know alot of people like to spend time with their friends and family. But what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family? Your friends might ask you to go to the park with them, and you say no because you are busy online. Your friends are going to start pulling away from you over time. You might end up being lonely and isolated from your social circle. Being on the computer constantly can ruins your life and relationships. If you are choosing the computer over other important thing like schoolwork or family dinners, then I think we have a problem. Going on the computer all the time can became an addiction, similar to other dependencies. I don't think people realize it, but it can happen gradually. I can take over your life and your schedule. I say this because when you have an addiction to anything, it is hard to stop and requires great effort. It is possible to stop all by yourself but thats rare and difficult. Majority of the times it is best to seek help from a professional or a support group, I personally think you should take all of these reasonings into consideration before you spend another long session on your computer.
612	614	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to inform you that I agree with the followings said on the writing prompt about computer overuse. First, I will be talking about how people use computer too much in their homes. Secondly, I would talk about people who talk online way too much on various platforms. Lstly, I would say spending to much time on their computers is a serious issue. To start, people that use computers too much often neglect other activities. First, people like to go on things such as myspace to connect with others, secondly people like playing online games for entertainment. ALstly, some people like to gosep to others online and share rumors. For example, if you go to soemones house you are always going to see a young kid or a parent online somewhere or playing online gmaes instead of talking. Also, peopel talk online way too much and forget face-to-face communication. First, they go to face book all the time to check updates. Secondly, they got ,myspace which you can get your identity stolen by strangers. Lastly, kids love to go on myspace it's the smae as myspace and other social sites. for example, peopel might come to you and say do you have a so and so and sya can I get your eamail address for messaging. Certainly, spoending too much time on their computers is bad for health and social skills. first, kids might have problems online and to keep the problem to get worst over time. Secondly, might be argueing with a friend over messages. Lastly, might nit be active but live playing or going other online websites for hours. So @CAPS1 did you start to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun in the real world? In conclusion, this was why I agreed with beign active because being on the computer all day would get your eyes tired and hard use too being on the computer @NUM1 hours a day, and it is better to go outside and play.
613	615	1	3	Computers should be for everyone! Dont you think?, I do. And here's how @CAPS1 gonna convince you with several key points. Computers can basically be called a gateway to learning and new information. Positive effects that computers have on peole is that, it teaches hand-eye coordination through practice, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and cultures, and even allow people to talk online with other people from different countries. These great qualities computers have for people are fantastic for education and connection. Also the fact that computers just keep upgrading as time goes by with new features. So, by you reading this introduction, I hope you are satisfied with what I am going to discuss in order to show you that computers are positive devices and can be helpful to everyone in many ways. Firstly, as I started in my introduction paragraph, computers help teach people hand-eye coordinates through various applications and games. This i believe is a good thing to know because without it, there arent many things you could do in modern life. For example fly a plane in a simulator. You wouldn't be able to do that without both hand and eye coordinates because you would have to manually move the plane, and check to see if everythings in order by multi-tasking your attention. Furthermore, this is just one given reason on why computers are positive towards everyone's benefit and skill development. Secondly, computers give people the ability tolearn about faraway places and people through the internet. This is also good for people's benefits because, theres knowledge in every bit of it for personal growth. Your learning about others cultures, heritage, family history, and so forth and so on from reliable sources. This could also help you in the long run with any job you want to do because knowledge can get you anywere in your career. It can get you very far in life so learn as much as you can, and I beleive computers can do so by providing access. This is another reason why computers can be positive for your future. As for the last reason, I say that peolple can also talk to other people online on the computer using messaging apps. This is also beneficial because again, like I stated in my @NUM1 paragraph, you can learn many things that way and meet new people from around the world. Now dont you think computers can benefit anyone in these ways! I do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers and their uses. For my conclusion, I would like to say that I hoped you enjoyed every bit of what I had to say, and you can also agree with the positive affects computers have on people for learning and communication. I truly beleive that computers are beneficial to all people and should continue to be around for future generations. it benefits society as a whole, and I enjoy every bit of using it for my projects. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important topic.
614	616	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, People always believe that technology today such as computers are making more and more people lazy and not going out into the real world such as people who don't spend time with family, become very unfit, and also @CAPS1 websites and people you talk to can put you in harms way and you can get hurt physically. First, who wouldn't want to spend time with family and find out things that happend to them during the day, @CAPS1 people because they are to busy being on the computer instead of going camping with the family, going to an amusement park and also some family gatherings for holidays. People who thinks that the computers is a helping thing to use but @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1 people learn much easier from family of friends then from a computer screen alone. Second, @CAPS1 people are becoming @CAPS2 and overweight because of computers intead of going for a walk or nice day they sit in their room and sit on the computer and seeing virtual things instead of seeing things in real life. @CAPS1 prove who are sitting on the computer people you might should be joining a sports learns with everyday practice to stay healthy. Last, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 that go on the computer and adults are getting into dangerous situations because of the of talking to people you have never seen or really know about their background. When you are on a chat room and someone asks where you live they can be lieing and you could take them seriously and meet up with them and that is how you can get killed or go missing from your home. Also, the computer allows you to put pictures and videos online and a lot of teens and adults are posting up on the internet very inapropriate pictures of these bodies and people should't be seeing that for safety reasons. I hope that if you or a family member is always on the computer you should say you need to spend time with your family, you can become very unfit from lack of movement, and you can be at risk of getting hurt by people you don't know online, so please be careful and limit your screen time for a better life."
615	617	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, i do not believe that computers benefit society in a positive way, I feel this way because I have heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time doing unproductive things like socializing. The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends for online activities. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming and take away from other important tasks. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising and staying active. Now, lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends because of computer use. Computers are very addicting, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them, though I can understand why certain individuals do it I dont think its right for relationships. I have many friends who would rather be on facebook or myspace than hang out with me in person. The web site listed above can really make you forget about reality and your real-life connections. My friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day chatting online. The reasons listed above tell you why I believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose and harming social bonds. Now, lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users each day. i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it on endless browsing. So when I read about people wasting time on the computer all day I, myself, was very upset about the loss of productivity! Statistics show that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours a day on average on the internet, statistics also show that the average aldut spends about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours on the computer a day on average for work and leisure. When I read the above statistics I came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing truly meaningful. Now, lets talk about exercising a bit more and its importance. I, myself, know that too much time is being spent on computers in today's world. By me knowing that I am aware of the fact that children are not exercising enough to stay healthy. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need it can cause health problems in the future, like heart disease. Statistics show that around @PERCENT1 of children under @NUM4 years of age are obese due to sedentary lifestyles. The above reasons tell you why I believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer for physical well-being. Now, lets bring this letter to an end by urging everyone to reconsider their computer habits and prioritize real-world interactions and health for a better society.
616	618	1	3	Dear @CAPS1: People are spending far too much time on computers. This goes for children and adults alike. Just think about it; anything you can do on a computer you can do without one. That and people need to spend more time outside experiencing nature. Lastly, some bad things can be shown and can happen while online. I challenge you to name one thing you can do on the computer that you can't do without. You can't even name one. Think about it: you can research and find pictures from books and magazines. Instead of social networking sites, you can actually go and see the person, or if they are far away you can call them or write them a letter. To find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news. If you like using computer design programs, try drawing a real picture instead. Lastly, if you download a lot of music you can just buy a cd or, better yet, go to see the band live. Face it, you can't do anything on a computer that actually requires the computer. Artificial simulations are no match for the real outdoors. On a computer all you can do is watch, and even that is nothing compared to the real thing; it's just a snapshot of it. Outside you can feel the gentle breezes, the warm sun, the cool grass; you can smell fresh pine and clean air. You can hear all the other creatures surrounding you. Going outside is better for you, too. Outside you get exercise and vitamin @CAPS2, while inside you get fat, lazy, and sick. Can't you see how great the outdoors are? Computers can do more harm than good. They can show children inappropriate pictures and talk about inappropriate topics. They are even now using computers to sell illegal drugs. Children also often use the internet irresponsibly and do things that can disrupt friendships and get them into trouble. The computer has also made it a lot easier for kidnappers to find children and kidnap them. They do this by pretending to be the child's peer, then using the information the child gives them, they will make an almost guaranteed kidnapping. This is happening more and more frequently. The computer isn't as helpful as you thought. Computers are not really beneficial to our society. They have no real use that isn't already taken care of. They cannot replace the real outdoors. Lastly, they can be easily used for bad, even illegal, purposes. As you can see, computers should not be used as much as they are being used by the general public.
617	619	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a society we have come very far regarding advancements and inventions. One invention has made a large impact in the world and still ceases to amaze; it's the computer. This piece of technology has so many benefits and positive effects on people that without it, everyone would be stupefied. For example, this device allows people to keep in touch using a common social network. In addition, specially designed computers can tend to peoples' specific needs. Furthermore, they allow you to expand your knowledge. Therefore computers have positive effects. Just think of all the people you've emailed or instant messaged in the past week... Your dad, while he was on his business trip, your aunt and uncle who e-mailed you pictures of their new born baby, your friends from camp... The list can go on and on. Computers like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 provide social networking like @CAPS4, i-chat, video chat and more so you can keep in touch with your family and friends. For example, in my life I use my @CAPS5 to video chat with my sister, @PERSON3, who is a freshman at college in @LOCATION1. It's our way of keeping in touch instead of not seeing her for months on end or having to pay for plane tickets every weekend to go down and see her. With the computer, keeping in touch with people in different towns, states, or even hemispheres is a piece of cake. However, computers also provide services for those with medical needs. If someone has just been rushed to the hospital for an emergency, computers will be used to monitor that person. @PERCENT1 of hospitals nationwide say that computers are essential in their facilities. For example, when my grandfather, @PERSON2, was being cared for at the @CAPS6 hospital, computers were used to make sure his heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood pressure were all in check. And, if something was wrong, the computer would alert the doctors. Therefore, computers are also a huge help in the medical department @CAPS1 well. Lastly, computers can expand one's knowledge. There are thousands upon thousands of websites; all of which can teach people different things. For example, if you are going on a trip to @LOCATION2 and wish to learn about their culture before you leave, you can just type it into your internet browser on your computer and bam! You're fully prepared for your vacation now because of your computer. Also, in my life, my teachers assign @CAPS1 research papers requiring us to find information on a topic. Perhaps going to the library isn't an option; how are you going to acquire the information? The answer is simple, go on the internet! Internet research is the top way amongst all colleges and universities to research. I was recently assigned a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 project by my social studies teacher, @PERSON1, where we got to choose my topic of community service and research it. Every student in my class used the computer in some way, shape, or form for their project. Thus, computers can allow you to get information efficiently. In conclusion, computers provide an abundance of uses. Primary ones include the ability to exchange messages with friends and family, help in the medical field, and expansion of knowledge. Henceforth, I believe that computers serve @CAPS1 a positive advancement in technology and its effect on people are rather great.
618	620	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? I think it has a positive effect. There are a few reasons for this. First, computers are used for education around the world. Second, they help us connect with and meet new friends. Lastly, you can use a computer for world news. As you can see, those are just a few reasons. First, computers are used for education around the world. For example, some people use them to go to college online. Others use them to find information on things like Egypt, where we can't go. Second, they help us connect with, and meet new friends. We can chat with our friends, which is very useful. If we need to know what a homework assignment was, we can just chat with a friend. Lastly, you can use a computer to find out about world news. We can go and find out if something serious happened, like the earthquake in Haiti. As you can see, those are just a few reasons I think that computers have a positive effect on us. I hope you agree with me on this matter.
619	621	1	3	Dear, @PERSON1 I think that computers are good for people. It helps them find where they are for, like a good to people and also with '@CAPS1' to show a computer @CAPS2 you go to look for a job. You have experience with computers to get a good paying job, to be flipping burgers @CAPS2 you got older. I know I had; I got older I know how to be a starter in life. I want to get a normal life, even though no life is normal. Also the computer is good to look for, like, even tell you how it has a five star, a @NUM1 star you don't want to go to. You rather go to a fire that is why a computer is so much better. A computer tells you I have hand good @NUM2 for if your is making fingers. Lots of people use computers; my teachers use computers every day on a regular basis. They look, send them into the computers, and give them names. What I am doing, the cmr's I of my teachers is this computer. That is what I think which computers are good for people and their future.
620	622	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that nature is better than spending way too much time on the computer? Well, generally speaking, I think it is and I'll give you only three reasons why. First of all, it's about the obesity percentage in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend a lot more time with your family. Finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time on the computer. Also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 are obese or overweight. Last year in @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. Wow, the rate went up like @PERCENT3 in each year. This info was online at www.tomatotalks.org. Another thing I would like to consider, spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing. All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere, especially at the dinner table, is a great way to talk about your child's problems in school, and also to learn their parent's mistakes too. Also share great laughs. Finally, the most important thing is what they will do for their future. Last, but not least, you can enjoy the greater outdoors, and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about. Also trees that give us oxygen too. Mother nature has its great benefits when your career is all about science. Computers are educational but nature is better for our health and well-being.
621	623	1	3	The people who are concerned about the bad on computers are right about a couple things, but good does come out of it. For instance, what is the military needs recruits for the army? They can post up their ad on the computers that everyone will see. And what about the people who drop out of school and they want a second chance? They can apply for school online. My last reason is what those people who have a hard time finding work can do; they always look up the best job for them over the internet. Read More to find out how the internet is good for society. First, as the army keeps losing more and more soldiers in combat and they try to recruit people, they can post their ad up over the internet. Sure they can mail it out but that would take forever for people to find out about it and learn about it. For example, they can post the ad up on Myspace and have thousands of people looking at it in minutes, which is a much faster and more efficient method of reaching a large audience. Finally, the internet is a great way for the military to recruit soldiers. Next, for those seeking education or employment, the internet provides vital opportunities. Online schools offer flexible schedules for those who need a second chance at education, allowing them to learn from home. Similarly, job seekers can use online portals to search for positions that match their skills and submit applications instantly, making the entire process more accessible and far-reaching than traditional methods. In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about computer use, the benefits in recruitment, education, and employment demonstrate its significant positive role in society.
622	624	1	3	There are many great things about computers. If we were to lose them then our lives would change dramatically. You can use computers for exercise, but then it is also up to the parents on limits. Last, it can save lives. Computers are great, but if we were to lose them, there would be no more internet. You wouldn't be able to talk to friends on Facebook or e-mail. Cell phone prices would go through the roof without the computer networks that manage their services. We would technically be going back twenty to thirty years. Last, without computers there would be more difficulty in large companies managing their operations and logistics. Computers can help exercise. One way is we can find closest gyms on the internet. We can find what is healthy to eat right away, accessing nutritional databases and fitness blogs. You can also get one of those Wii Fit games for a computer. Also you can find free work out videos on platforms like YouTube. Next, it should be up to the parents. It is their discretion if they see that the child is spending too much time on the computer and gaining weight; they can easily limit it. They can say for every hour you're on the computer you have to do an hour of exercise, ensuring a healthy balance. Lastly the computer can save lives. Before computers, medicine like Tylenol was used for everything: stuffy nose, headache, cold etc. Now we can go on the computer to find whether the medication is at all dangerous by checking official medical websites. You can also find the nearest hospital using online maps and services. Finally, computers can do a lot of good, even though it can make you less healthy if you spend too much time on it; it can save your life. It can also destroy companies and our lives if misused, but parents can give limits and computers can be used to exercise. So reading this essay please don't take away our computer.
623	625	1	3	"Wouldn't you agree that spending time on the computer takes away half of your life? Going on the computer can have a negative effect on you! Personally I think not going on the computer benefits you, it's more time for your family, going outside, and staying healthy! Certainly going on the computer will mean less time for exercising. For example, lets say you went on the computer for an hour, that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit! Think about the choices here; you could either sit on a chair and play on the computer or take a nice run and burn a ton of calories! Statistics show that a significant percentage of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise, are in risk for health problems including obesity. As you can clearly see going on the computer really isn't the healthiest choice to make. Most definitely going on a walk or enjoying nature is better than going on a computer. A girl named Sarah, from Colorado said, ""I love to enjoy the beauty of the outdoors that god gave to me I wish I knew that years ago while I was a lazy woman on the computer. If you just even look out your window to see this beautiful world god created for us you would want to go out there and enjoy it! Everyone wants to live like they're dying or in other words live life to the fullest! In order to do that you have to see life and go out there and experience it, not sit on a computer! Without a doubt this world is gorgeous and it is worth while to see the nature! Everyone knows that family comes before everything! For example, you might love the computer but that love should not over power your time you spent with your family! One day on a Tuesday night Jane was on the computer and her mother called saying, ""Jane it's time for dinner"", Jane ignored her mom and chose to go on the computer! Now you really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important! I know with my heart and saw that my family means the world to me and everyone should have more time for each family member, not the computer! It's now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not! With no computers you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine! Most importantly it will not only benefit you but it will mean a lot to your family so what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and spend some quality time with your family and embrace the world around you!"
624	626	1	3	Does computers have an effect on people? Do they have a good effect or bad effect. Dear Local Newspaper, I agree they have a good effect on people because you can learn from them, you can look at maps if you're leaving out the state, they're good to talk to people online, and you can shop online. I don't think adults spend too much time on computers than exercising; I think kids are mostly on the computer playing games and other activities. However, some people use computers for homework, writing papers, or searching for people. Computers are good ways to learn about people and words; they're not just for playing games and listening to music, they are for good use. You can look up restaurants and look at their prices, and certain websites show sites where you can look at episodes of T.V. shows online. I think computers are better than books and dictionary because you can do all that stuff on a computer, and it is often faster. Some people think computers are good things to have cause it's fast and easy. Some people think computers are a waste of time on them. Computers are good because if you need to write a paper you can type it and print it instead of having messy hand writing. Computers are good for if you're in a rush to search something; it's fast. Computers are useful for anything like books, writing paper, websites, chatting with friends, web maps, music, games and etc. They do have a good effect on people and kids by providing a powerful tool for communication, education, and entertainment all in one place.
625	627	1	3	Dear local newspaper editor, I do agree that people should be exercising more, spending time with family and friends. The issue is with whether more people should spend less time on their computers and more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, or should it be the other way around. The first reason why I think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because I think that parents need to watch and model the way they eat and keep themselves fit because they are responsible. They need to see their kid eat and then go out exercising and then do it themselves, setting a good example. My second reason is I think that people should spend time enjoying nature then on the computer. The reason I think this is because they would never know what is happening outside if they are always on the computer. How can you never experience the beautiful things nature has to offer? My third reason is interacting with friends and family. I think that people should prioritize friends and family then on the computer because by interacting with friends and family you learn things that you never knew about them and you can go places you never would, discovering new things you never would in your life otherwise. For example, over vacation I did things and learned things about my family and friends that I never knew before, and that was because I was interacting with people. I learned how fun they really are and interesting and happy. Have fun where is the computer in that? Please don't let your life pass you by; live your life. It's now or never; should people spend more time on computers or more time exercising and interacting with family and friends? The choice for a more active and connected life is clear.
626	628	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine where the world would be without computers? Our daily lives would be dull and boring without new technology. Computers help society do various activities that would be impossible if we didn't have computers. They give us the ability to learn at home, connect with other people, and give a source of entertainment. From these reasons our lives become easy and convenient, which is what @CAPS2 people strive to accomplish. The ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased. It has gone from just being able to go to school to the @CAPS2 various ways to increase your intelligence on the computer. Programs such as @ORGANIZATION1, which teaches people how to speak a language, are available on the computer. These programs are like going to school, but more accessible to the public. To further help the public, there are ways to gain college degrees online. Even if you go to school a computer @CAPS1 still help you excel in your work; @CAPS2 sources of research are available on the computer and if you like to browse the web a computer is a great place for fun. However, some people still think computers are not good. They claim that people are gaining weight, but on the other hand, the computer gives people websites to help lose weight. They also say people aren't enjoying nature, even though there are @CAPS2 ways to appreciate it on the computer. Lastly, it is stated that you don't get real social interaction. To conclude, computers greatly benefit us and are good. New technology is a good thing and should keep expanding because of gaining the ability to learn, connect with people and having fun, a computer helps the general public. Please, think of what I have said and buy a computer!
627	629	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 the ages, technology has constantly been evolving and improving the way we think and live. From the first simple telephone in the @DATE1's to today's touch-screen iPhone. From riding horses to riding extraordinarily fast sports cars and high-speed trains. The advances in technology have proven the sky is not the limit with the invention of planes. We have even reached the moon and left our mark! Computers have only become faster and more powerful. Although more and more people are using one of our greatest technological advances, computers, some believe it doesn't benefit us socially. I wholeheartedly believe that computers are a benefit. They have the ability to store and teach us what seems like infinite information; second, they have made the world a smaller place through communication. Last, they even have the ability to locate missing people. Computers are constantly helping society. They follow what technology should do to make life @CAPS3. First of all, computers are a benefit to society because they have the ability to store and teach us what seems like infinite information. Today, when someone knows or wants to learn something, the first place they usually go is to a computer. This is because search engines such as @ORGANIZATION1 have virtually no limits, with so much information on any topic being available. This has not only made learning @CAPS3, but has also helped in studying for tests from elementary school to university. Computers also offer many tools for the average person. From banking to creating presentations, computers help with all! For this reason, even older individuals such as @PERSON1 are starting to find computers less weird. Second, computers benefit society because they make the world smaller through communication. Sixty years ago, it could take weeks to contact a relative on the other side of the world. Today, you can easily video call a relative in @LOCATION2 from @LOCATION1 in less than ten seconds. Not only can you talk to grandma or grandpa but you can even see them smile, which children can especially enjoy through applications such as @CAPS4. When there is a crisis, they can still talk to ease the worries of family. Finally, computers benefit society because they have the ability to locate missing people. Think of the record earthquake in @LOCATION3. There were cries of mothers searching for children whom they were separated from. It is thanks to computers that these families were reunited. On many sites on the internet, @LOCATION3 set up person locators. These locators allowed you to write down your name so family could find you should a disaster ever happen. Not only this, you could find your family. All they had to do was look for your name! Computers have even made our society safer. What more could you ask for? In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers benefit society because computers contain so much information and programs, they have proven the earth is a ""small world after all"" and they have made the world safer. It is clear that many people are buying computers, so why don't you get one?"
628	630	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I am writing you this letter, about computers, in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1 the people in @LOCATION1 has a computer, but are they really healthy? I don't believe computers are a good thing. People spend too much time on them & less time exercising, enjoying nature & most of all, it's highly dangerous. I don't believe computers are a good thing because people don't exercise like they used to. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a day on computers; for others it's their whole life. People spend so much time on computers they lose touch with the outside world. Ever since computers came out, obesity rates have gone up. All people do is chat to other people & think ""they don't have to know what I look like."" They sit at the computer eating & eating. That's not healthy. I don't think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature. It used to be when I had some free time, I could call up a friend & ask them to take a walk with me somewhere & they'd say ""sure!"" Now they say ""@CAPS1 get on the computers & we can take a virtual walk."" That's not the same as an actual walk with the wind in your face, the fresh smell, & all the animals, at least not to me. Nature is a thing of beauty & if you don't enjoy and appreciate it, it'll turn into something hideous. Nature used to be the most peaceful thing; now it is the internet. I don't think computers are good because most importantly they're dangerous. Little kids, like myself, think they're grown up & go on computers & meet rapists, murderers, thieves, all kinds of criminals. Also people send hurtful & violent things to each other & if you're on the computer a lot of bad people can track you down. Also, the military & @ORGANIZATION1 keeps secrets on computers but if you're smart enough you can hack into it. Computers aren't safe for anyone or anything. Well, I've told you my main @NUM4 reasons why I think computers aren't such great things; they're not healthy, emotionally or physically. People don't exercise, they don't enjoy nature & computers are highly dangerous. All I can do is hope you publish my letter so everyone can see my point of view & make their own decisions about computer use."
629	631	1	3	Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are good. You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math and science. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online from your own home. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier with people far away. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people face-to-face. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people you know. Last of all, computers are for our entertainment and fun. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free and enjoyable. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music of your choice. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone online. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons of people would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that we should appreciate computers for all the good things they do for us.
630	632	1	3	People using computers is a good way for them to talk with distant relatives or friends, learn keyboarding skills, and research about far-away places. First, the wonderful technology that computers have is amazing. They can surf the web in milli-seconds. This benefits people because if you were doing a research paper on China, many search engines let you surf the web at blazing fast speed, and in a little time, you could have all the information you needed. Scientists say that @PERCENT1 of computer-users have fast internet, and they recommend it to other, first-time buyers. The computer that I use is a unique computer that was customizable to my liking. I like playing games and editing videos, so I got an outstanding graphics card that has outstanding speeds for rendering videos. This let me play games and edit videos, and my @NUM1 gb hard drive is capable of storing all my programs and projects, for future use. Doing many things on the computer can really help your hand-eye coordination. In fact, about @PERCENT2 of computer users say that over a period of using a computer, they were able to type @PERCENT3 quicker that they could before. That's a very good number, but the average person who types could write a @NUM2 page paper in the time I have. I can type a paper that big in about @NUM3 minutes because I have been typing for many other @NUM3 years. Computers are a big part of my life and I still have time to do other things with my family, and friends. The last thing that computers help us people with is chatting with friends on websites, like facebook, myspace, and @ORGANIZATION1. They all let you share updates with all of your friends, and if you needed to, you could chat with far away friends or relatives. This helps because if you haven't talked to your cousin in a while, you can check up with him and talk about things. I have a cousin who graduated college and is now teaching in @LOCATION1, and when our family gets together, we webchat with him on @ORGANIZATION1 and it is helpful because we haven't seen him in @NUM5 years, and we all wanted to see what he was up to. He was also able to send us pictures, which helped because we all missed his face. So, from blazing fast speed to chatting with distant relatives, these are key factors that show us that you can have fun on computers and still have time for family and friends.
631	633	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a good effect on people in our community. From computers you can learn, talk to people from out of state or even out of the country, and you can also learn hand-eye coordination. Computers can help you learn in many ways; one way students can use them is by going online to find information for their school projects. By finding this information, it can help the students get better grades. Also, the students can use the computer as a way to study for their tests and assignments. There are educational games on the computer that kids play, and without knowing it, they are learning and studying for school while having fun. Another way you could learn is from online classes. This could help people who do not have enough money to pay to go to physical classes. As you can see, there are many ways to learn from having a computer. The computer can also help you talk to people from out of the state or country. This could help families stay connected when they live so far away from you. My cousin @PERSON4 and my aunt @CAPS1 live in @LOCATION1 and I hadn't met them until @DATE1, when they came down. Now that I have met them, I am able to stay in touch with them through the computer. Dr. @PERSON2 says, ""Staying close with family and friends is not only important for your health."" By having computers we could talk to our relatives and help our health by reducing feelings of loneliness. When you get out of college, people let go of some good friends because they could live in a different state; the computers can help you stay connected with them. Lastly, computers can help you with your hand-eye coordination. When you are trying to type a word, your hand-eye coordination improves because you are learning to hit the correct keys. I have seen kids with special needs; using the computer is helping them learn hand-eye coordination. There is a girl in my school named @PERSON3 and they help her by letting her play games on the computer. When in my class, I've had to help her with picking things up, learning to eat, and walking with her hands alone. Her helper teacher, Ms. @PERSON1, says the computer game has helped her a great deal. The effect that computers have on society is good and beneficial for everyone."
632	634	1	3	Hi, do you think that if you use the computers too much then you will not exercise and you will not enjoy the outside nature? Talking and playing with your friends and family might not happen because computers are needed for our needs. One click can help a lot of people and can save lives as the more our technology advances, we will also advance. It can help a person look for a needed job and you can still talk or chat with best friends or just your grand mom. The computer can help with your homework or help someone learn to talk in English and to jump start that new job or store. They can buy things that they will like, and if they like it they will come back for more, leading the store to hire more people and to expand into a lot of stores. Another good reason is the computer is good to cook food and to make new recipes, all in one click of the mouse, making life easier and more convenient for everyone at home.
633	635	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 of late there has been controversy over how computers affect people's lives. I believe that the effects on people are negative. My main reasons for this argument are the person's health and the user's well-being. Did you know that over @PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese? Computers can contribute to this statistic. If a person is eating unhealthy food but is active, they can still be fit, but if they go on the computer instead of working it all off, they become fat. This can be a serious problem. Becoming overweight has many health risks like heart disease and others. It also could prevent a person from exercising. If they are overweight, their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge. Do you want an increase in obesity rates? I would think not. If you watch TV you could see picture-perfect families. We all know that no family is like that. Introducing computers could mess up that fact even more. For example, my cousin used to be an outgoing, friendly person. Now because of computers he is a @LOCATION1 who does nothing else but play on the computer. He gets up, eats breakfast, then plays on the computer until lunch. He eats a small lunch and goes right back to playing. After a long session of @NUM2 to @NUM3 more hours of playing, he gets off the computer, hops into bed, and goes on his laptop all night. This greatly affects his family. They try to get him off but all he does is stay online. He can't interact with his family and this has a huge impact on them. Even though he could get off and talk, one of the only ways of talking to him is through Facebook. Now because of this, the family is struggling. We can easily avoid this by telling everybody these known facts. My final argument for you is the user's well-being. Many of us teens have a Facebook or @CAPS3 account. I have homework I need to use the internet for, for facts and stories. But instead, I often go on Facebook. If anyone does this, it affects our grades. If we chat on Facebook we are not doing our homework. If we aren't doing our homework we won't get a good grade, which could lead to other serious problems. Another thing is that you could actually need your computer to stay happy. It could be addicting and you might rely on it; ""once a person wanted to kill himself because he didn't have his computer"". So @CAPS2, you can see there are many negative effects on a user of a computer. It could cause many problems in the future like health issues and family unhappiness. So spread the word for the sake of thousands of people and their futures."
634	636	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people, companies, and small businesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their business. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful for completing tasks efficiently. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice and integrate them into their curriculum. I highly recommend that you get acquainted with such a useful and very recognized piece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small businesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is a former district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work, which helped her manage the district smoothly. This proves my point that companies and small businesses require the features of a computer to effectively run the business of which they run or are employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new heights. Some teachers, including my own @PERSON1, have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their daily teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity and importance of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real-world. In my opinion, I think it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places today. Computers are used by millions of people every day for work and for learning. Such businesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 and are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company operations. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful, teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms to enhance learning. I hope it is not just me that sees the good that a computer brings, but anyone else that @MONTH1 have taken a glance at this letter will understand their immense value.
635	637	1	3	Dear, To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I am writing this to inform you about how the computers benefit society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites inappropriately. People use @CAPS1 messaging and it's also a way of getting connected to others. I also think that some people are addicted because you can search for someone or browse @CAPS5. You can find top websites that may be inappropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad for the education of some kids who are trying to learn; the majority of kids use computers for internet access, and most kids will be on the computer playing games that may not be suitable for their age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people use websites to check their emails. For example: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 mail, etc. My other reason for you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People use @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they may not know. People say it's a faster connection to people they could not otherwise reach. For example: a person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by, & the person lives in another town. I also think it is good for research or to browse for people. For example, you know someone but you can't find them, so you can browse online. Another point is that people may become addicted. For example: they go on a website & they go on it over & over & over again. They don't stop using it until it is gone. In addition, people think it keeps them busy. For example, if you don't have anything to do, you go on the computer. Lastly, you find top websites that may be inappropriate for users. For example, you find a website but it's not suitable for minors. Only @CAPS5 adults should watch it. One more thing, computers aren't all bad for education. For example, you can learn from appropriate websites that build brain muscles and help you think. My opinion is that I do think computers benefit the society because they mainly help you brainstorm & you get to know websites & learn about them, expanding your knowledge and connecting you to the world.
636	638	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Times, I am writing in regards to the article recently written in your newspaper on computers. I believe that they are a vital part of the world today because; you can find information for a project or article in far less time then searching through books, you can get important news updates and entertainment is only a click away. My first reason is about the information on the internet. Say you were writing a paper on ancient Egyptians, and you need to know how to spell hieroglyphics; looking in a dictionary that would take a few minutes, while online it would take about @NUM1 seconds. Or if you wanted to know when @ORGANIZATION1 died. It would take hours scouring textbooks until you finally found it, whereas online it might take you just over a minute. The second reason I like computers is for news updates. You can figure out what happened in recent natural disasters, or how your stock is doing. Also computers helped us in the recent election, and will continue to do so for a long time. The weather can always be found on the web for any location in the world. This is a great thing if you're planning a trip somewhere, which you can also do with a computer. My third and final reason is that its hard to get bored on a computer. Everywhere on the web are cool games or funny videos. On the web there are about @NUM2 gaming sites and @NUM3 sites with funny, weird, or cool videos and pictures. Many other places like Facebook let you share pictures with your friends, family, and relatives. Or you can chat with complete strangers from around the world. So next time you need information, news, or you are just bored, go on your computer and have fun exploring the vast possibilities it offers.
637	639	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that people are spending too much time on computers, and I agree because people spend so much time on computers that @CAPS2 gets addicting, people don’t get enough exercise, and eyesight gets worse. So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of the computer. Most of all @CAPS2 gets really addicting for a lot of people that they don’t spend time with their families or siblings and some kids get so addicted that they come from school and start using the computer all day and don’t study for a test or do homework. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they don’t exercise or play sports with their friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer to check @CAPS3 and Facebook like I do, but I just check my Facebook and then go play basketball. One of the biggest problems that I think is when you sit on the computer too long and get a headache and it ruins your eyesight. So thank you for reading my letter and I hope you agree with me about these significant concerns.
638	640	1	3	Dear Editor, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a lot of great things you can do on computers. A lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because, say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over the world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our family wants to go on vacation to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about it. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying; one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Surveys show that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass their test and get a higher grade percentage by +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and doesn’t know what a word is they can look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great tool for your well being and personality development.
639	641	1	3	My opinion is that people spend too much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if they’re too concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people won’t enjoy hanging out with their friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way too much and not have fun with their family and friends. People ignore their parents when on the computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when they're talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them; about @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, people concentrate too much on the computer that they don’t do homework or any school work. If they don’t do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back a grade. Now for my third reason. Third, people won’t enjoy hanging out with their friends. On the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer; you should go out with your friends and enjoy yourself, creating real memories together.
640	642	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing a letter to you today because I have heard a complaint that more and more people are using computers and getting less exercise. These experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends more. These experts @MONTH1 be smart but they are wrong. I am going to tell you how they are wrong. My first example is that people that go on the computer a lot still exercise. Take Twitter as an example. The football player Ocho-Cinco ""tweets"" all the time but that doesn't mean he doesn't get exercise. There are plenty of sports players that are on Twitter and they are fit. Most of the kids in my grade including me have a Facebook, and most of the kids are fit. Just because they are on the computer a lot doesn't mean they can't exercise. My second example is the effect of the computer in schools. Students use the computer for a lot of things. We use Wikipedia for our projects and to research a person. Some schools nowadays almost depend on computers. I remember when I lived in the country we never had to really type anything unless it was a project. When I moved to @CAPS3 I am always typing something. Even a rough draft they want me to type. In the country I would write out my final draft, but now I have to use the computer. Schools also are teaching us about the computer @CAPS4, and as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on it more and more. When someone finds out a new website they're going to tell their friends and they're going to pass it on and @CAPS4 on. My third example is how the experts say that people are spending too much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends. My grandpa, aunt, and other family members have a Facebook account. That means I can still interact with family and friends online. The people that are on the computer a lot that are adults probably don't have family over every night and probably go out with friends every once in a while. Computers also benefit society; for business people they might have to do a PowerPoint and they need a computer. When experts say we need to enjoy nature, interact with family and friends, and do more exercising they might be right, but we can do all these things and also still go on the computers. If you take a survey in @CAPS3 to see how many people are on the computer almost everyday and then you ask them how many of them exercise, you would see that you can do both activities successfully."
641	643	1	3	"Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is beneficial at times, but to me the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of spending too much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target kids, and the interference that spending too much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that the largest number of people affected by spending too much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right after school drop their backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesn't get done. That absence of homework could make an enormous decline on a student's average. However, homework is not the only school work affected by the computer. Even in school kids use the internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task assigned to them. Not getting work done is not the only problem computers present to kids. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. A lot of kids are bullied and picked on at school but then that bullying carries itself to the child's home through the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone's feelings, it can hurt their self esteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework weren't bad enough, there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about you because of how much time you spend on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use it to gain your trust and the problem only escalates from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, they're not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lures adults into spending all their time on the computer is all the ""great deals"" they can find. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then they show you all the benefits from buying from them and once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From there you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that really sound like a ""great deal?"" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definitely outweigh the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals, keep their bank accounts full and their identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family, or enjoying life!"
642	644	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society. First of all, if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them. Also, with computers, people can communicate with people from across the world. If people use computers more often they'll probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market. Because of this computers can greatly help any community. Computers can give many chances for exploring education. People can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books. People can find almost anything they want to know about on the internet relatively easily. If not for solely learning but for reference, if someone is making a project at a school, computers can expand on many people's opportunities for education. Secondly, the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from say, @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C in a matter of seconds. Similarly if two people are separated by a large distance, they can easily communicate; since the invention of social networking, people that @MONTH1 have lost touch can easily meet again and discuss things. With computers communication is becoming faster and faster. Finally, because of an over-expanding job market, use of computers is becoming a common requirement of many professions. Most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting. Also now most governments are networked with files on computers. Also, most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly. Because many jobs require experience with computers they should be a part of any community. In conclusion, experience with computers can benefit any one person and an entire society all together.
643	645	1	3	The computer affects people's lives by taking them away from their family and there are @NUM1 reasons why the computer affects people's lives. They do not know what is happening outside. Their family. Their job. Please listen to my reason why the computer affects people's lives! My first reason is they don't know what is happening outside because they are too much busy on the computer. Their friends could have won something important and they wanted you to be there but no they are just so busy on the computer. They are going to miss out on nature or hanging out with friends. Like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they would come it just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is their family. I said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation and many more. It's like if one of their family members is hurt and they are trying to call you but you don't pick up the phone because you are too busy on the computer to pick it up. You can lose your wife because of the computer because you forgot her birthday, her anniversary because you are on the stupid computer. About their kids, what happens if they want to play or have you read them a card? You say no because of your computer. Their family will get ruined. My third and last reason is their job. They can lose their job because you missed work cause you're on the computer for doing nothing related to work. If they lose their jobs they can't pay for their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer cause they have been on it too much and did not pay attention to what was happening. They are going to feel like they are going to lose it because they don't have their computer. Or the computer shuts down and he can't get enough money to get an electrician. Those were all my reasons. They don't know what is happening outside. Their family. Their job. Thank you for listening to my reasons.
644	646	1	3	Today in our society almost everyone uses computers whether @CAPS4 to do research, play games, or interact with others. These are all positive things. The schools across America are using computers from @NUM1 grade to online colleges. People benefit from computers by getting everything and anything done from them. @CAPS2 anyone who has a brain can realize that computers are a positive in today's society. First off computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you. You can play on them, and interact with others. The reason that the computer being able to get almost anything done for you @CAPS4 a good thing is because if you need to get work done you can do that; if you need research @CAPS1 can do that and @CAPS1 can help you in any subject. The reasons that playing games can be positive @CAPS4 @CAPS1 does not only give you great hand eye coordination but @CAPS1 also exercises your brain and can be a learning tool for young children. The reasons that interacting through the computer @CAPS4 that you learn how to be and talk through email for businesses and make many @CAPS2. Please use your brain and see that computers help our society today. @CAPS2 to keep on going Americans are smart people and are doing very well. I @CAPS3 have to tell you that @CAPS4 why we send every one of them to school @NUM2 of every year. With that said they use computers. Anyone who says that computers are bad should think about the things that you love to do while using this technology. That is using computers and benefiting your life. @CAPS2 as you can see that computers are a thing for the good and can benefit today's society @CAPS2 I beg you for your sake please use computers and benefit your life. It is for your own good.
645	647	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benefit society. Computers help us in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents, get better at or learn a foreign language, and get information. So without further ado here is more extensive reasoning. First of all, computers help us store many documents. Without computers, companies that involve auctioning and many other things would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around everywhere @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make, store, and send your newspaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help us learn or get better at foreign languages. Computers help us learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have a grandmother, she learned Spanish using a computer. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help us get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records, directions, etc. In the year @DATE1 people didn't have computers but when the first router was made the people's intelligence went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became very rich and a kid even grad college at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furthermore computers benefit us a lot. There's storing devices, helping us get better at learning a foreign language and getting information. So please make the right choice and think about what computers do for us.
646	648	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers make a big role in modern city life. For this reason I think that @CAPS4 should take the advantage that @CAPS4 have. @CAPS4 could do lots of things with computers. @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS7 related @CAPS6, like homework and projects. @CAPS4 could use it for info on a project or homework assignment. @CAPS4 could use it for the @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and @CAPS10, and many other reasons why @CAPS4 should have @CAPS12 for @CAPS7. @CAPS4 could use the computers for @CAPS5 @CAPS6, like making holiday and birthday cards. They could pay bills for mortgages online. @CAPS4 could book a hotel online for a vacation. @CAPS4 could play on or against others with online games. @CAPS4 could use it for bidding on eBay or Amazon. They could pay bills for long distance calling. @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS13 if you missed an episode. Or just watch @ORGANIZATION1 shows in general for entertainment. @CAPS4 could use it for chatting online, like sending emails or talking on ooVoo. So that's why @CAPS4 should take the advantage of what computers offer.
647	649	1	3	Dear Newspaper, In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. One reason is because people can learn about new things, it makes life a little easier then it is, and lastly, people can meet new people while they're on the computer. First off, we can benefit from computers because we can learn new things. People can find places that they've never heard of, or they can see whats going on in the world through news sites. Computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things for their classes. Computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future for work or personal life. Secondly, having computers in our society can make life a little easier for some people. On computers, you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them at a store. For people with no transportation, this'll help make their lives a little easier than it is. Or, for example, if a person wants to buy something that isn't in stores yet, they can go online, and they might have it up there for sale. Lastly, having computers can help you meet new people through social media. If someone just moved from another town or state, this will help them meet new people in their area. Or if a student doesn't know anybody from their new school, they might find them online and then they'll be able to get to know each other before classes start. In conclusion, computers help our society in a lot of ways. They can help us learn new things, we all can meet new people, and computers can make our lives a little easier. That's why I think we should keep computers in our society.
648	650	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Imagine a world where no information could be saved for the whole world to observe; a place with no communication with loved ones or friends; or a life with no possible way of learning of catastrophes on the other end of the earth. Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education, and a way to stay in contact with friends and family; I'm sure our world greatly benefits from this miracle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what their astronauts saw. But computers made the experience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered receiving some of the first footage of the moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video were released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1 states ""@PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We make our students become involved in technology. These are the people who progress to make the best medicine, cars and computers. Our students all are beneficial to our world today."" Why should we settle for anything less for our childrens' education? In the middle of tragedy; faced with a difficult decision; or even just lonely, longing for someone to count on; who do you turn to first? Your loved ones are always there for you when you need them. Now because of our access to computers, whether across the world or just the other end of the block, we will always be in contact with the ones we love. @PERSON2, my friend, found out her aunt was diagnosed last year with cancer. However, she was in a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing and @CAPS7. She could even contact her doctors to see her condition after appointments. Her aunt conquered cancer with her niece and is living happily. With only a @NUM1 chance of living, @PERSON2 gave her the support she needed through the most difficult @CAPS2. Not only did she see the positive effects of staying in contact. Marcos, a family therapist, says ""@NUM2 of happy families stay in contact after separating through the internet."" How could anyone, ever leave those who you care most about behind? Imagine a world with a full education for our children to take advantage of and a place where we can stay with each other all the time. That's the world we live in today."
649	651	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, Since @DATE1, people have been doing less exercise and not enjoying the great outdoors. There are some people that are having less family and friends time. I say its computers! This machine is a great resource, but people are starting to get addicted to it. We need to reach a message to those people. Yesterday, I went to my local library and found @NUM1 computers in the library. All of the computers were filled with people and, a line with @NUM2 people ready to go on next. I ask those @NUM2 people ""why were they there?"" ""for homework"" said a teenager. Another, ""just to come and play games"". I also ask, ""how do they stay fit?"" ""I don't like staying fit"" said a beautiful lady. ""Staying fit isn't easy if your always on the computer"" said the teenager. The response I got from those people, were unbelievable. If we don't stay fit how are we going to survive from all these diseases and cancer. This reason has plenty to do with not staying fit. I don't know about you but I care about my family, I would never spend the rest of my life in front of a computer instead of my love ones. In the end, I was surprise to find out that projects, homework and research can take up half of your time, away from your family. On the computer, you can find some resort for you and your friends and family, but you can't be doing that for more than a few minutes. The great outdoors should be one of the best places to be because it is quiet, it is amazing and it is a large area. If you are looking up the outdoors on a computer, now that's a waste of time, that you could have been with a family member in the park or where ever. My father says its great to read about it but it is better to live it. The days are getting shorter so lets live it like he says."
650	652	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I agree that computers have an effect on people. It helps people learn hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and you can talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. As @CAPS1 grow up, they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling. There are many online programs that teach @CAPS1 how to type properly. Once the @CAPS1 get interested in learning how to type, they end up typing very fast. Computers help @CAPS1 of the future learn with all these learning websites; @CAPS1 will be able to teach themselves new things. Isn't it a blessing to be able to meet people from afar? You'll get to learn their cultures and traditions. Would you want to know something about another country? They make the daily world go around, there you'll find them. Well its so interesting that learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends. Have you connected with someone online? One day I will meet people who don't just want to be friends, maybe more than that. Be positive about online chatting, or online dating services, as they can connect people. As you can see for my reasons above, the computer has an effect on people. The computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, it also gives you the ability to learn about faraway places & people, and it allows you to chat with other online people. Make sure you stay positive & be safe on the computers.
651	653	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if wasn't @CAPS4 the computers we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other contries like we do now. Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information, providing news articles and official reports. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her, which saves a lot of time and effort. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society and that they provide many clear advantages for learning and connecting with others.
652	654	1	3	Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers, as we would be healthier and less dependent on problematic technology.
653	655	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think computers are used way to much in this society! People spend more hours sitting the computer than exercising because people find it more thrilling spending more time with computers than trreadmills! People in this society think we are spending to much time on the computers, while others don't realize how long they've been staring at a screen for! I am one of those people who like using the computer a lot but I have relized changes. I can tell many others and spend to much time with the computer screen that we have drifted away from our familys! I never really thought about how much I don't talk to them anymore because I'm to busy cyberly chatting with friends. Although, I don't think we should get the computer either. Online we can research almost everything in the world. I can even type my name in a research bar and find me and anybody else with the excel same name as me! The internet got for more technical in the past years. Without it, these days, just about everybody would be lost, unable to find information quickly. The internet should be used less on blogging and chatting, and should be used more on things more useful like @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you consider this and see that while computers are useful, we must be careful not to overuse them and harm our personal relationships and health.
654	656	1	3	I believe that computers are a great help to society I believe this @CAPS3 when you don'@CAPS1 know something you could go on-line to look it up. Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer. My first reason was that if you don'@CAPS1 know something you could look it up. A lot of times you could be watching @CAPS1.V. or talking with someone and you @CAPS4 wonder what something is or means. @CAPS6 instead of just letting whatever you didn'@CAPS1 know just pass on you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others to. My next reason was that if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have the time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to you door. This is a great help to the people who are to sick @CAPS3 sometimes they are @CAPS6 said they can'@CAPS1 leace there home @CAPS6 instead of starving to death they can have food or anything @CAPS7 to them if they just click a couple of buttons on the computer. Now, also this could help the people who are to busy to go to stores @CAPS3 right before they leave they could press some buttons and when they get home there stuff on sitting there for you. Back when my dad was a @CAPS2 and my mom was a vice-president of a drug producing company which sold oxy-cofin they had to have a grocery @CAPS5 ship foods to our house. They had to have this happen @CAPS3 they @CAPS4 worked long hours and they didn'@CAPS1 have the time to go to a grocery @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they had the food @CAPS7 to our house which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green right, @CAPS6 instead of cutting down more trees we can just have all that on our computer which doesn'@CAPS1 we any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society. I could come up with many more ideas but can'@CAPS1 fit them just in this story, @CAPS6 finally rember people whole lives are on their computers, which shows how essential they have become for daily tasks and information.
655	657	1	3	The use of computers is great for everyone. Using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world. Also you can have the ability to talk to people. With a computer you can also learn about places all over the @LOCATION1 and the world. With a computer everyone can learn about people all over. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere in @LOCATION2 you could learn about what those people do. Also you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1 the computer would help a lot. You can search what thet wear and what holdays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends to. if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it. While using a computer you can also talk to people. With the use of @CAPS1 or A.I.M you can talk to your friends easily. You can ask them what homework you had if you weren't in dschool. You can also become better well friends with people you didn't know that wll, by saying hello, or how was your day. You can also email. If you meet someone you made friends with on vacation you can email them. You can also go to websites where you can talk to people in other countris. If you have a webcamyou can even video chat, and ask them questions about their country, or what they like. Also you can videochat with all yor friends to. Using a computer you can learn about places arounf the world. If you were going to a place ypu didn't know, you could look up the amazing resraurants, you could also look up fun things to do with the family. If you needed to do a projecct you can look up what the weather is like, and what the people do. if you wanted to help out a country that just had an earthquake or hurricane you could look up what you could do to help that country. Those three reasons are why compujters are essential to people. You can learn about different people, talk to your friends, and you can search and learn about different places arounf the world, making life more connected and informed for everyone.
656	658	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, The dilemma over computers needs to be noticed. People need to realize computers are one of the greatest inventions we have in our time, but in my opinion people take that as an advantage and misuse them for purposes that they should not be used. Computers are not meant to be for playing games, or constantly instant messaging. They are meant for learning purposes and for work or school. Why do people use computers for things that they don't need? People use computers for fun! They instant message, listen to music, go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. People also use @CAPS4 and play games on unknown websites. Computers are not meant to be for that, they are for school and work. @ORGANIZATION2, Word, @ORGANIZATION2, and PowerPoint, if computers were used for those purposes people wouldn't be the way they are today. In the @LOCATION1 the computer is very popular people absolutely love it! But these people are the people who are unfriendly, mean and sad. They also are incredibly out of shape. I know so many people who use computers instead of doing homework and getting fresh air. They are so independent they do when they go home from school is eat and play on the computer. I have a hard time understanding why they do that but I guess they feel they have nothing else better to do. I also know people who use the computer the right way and they are very happy people. They also have so much knowledge and there is never a dull conversation with them. Those people use the computer everyday but they use it correctly only for work and study and they are just well are very smart and get good grades in school! Basically, what I am trying to say is that people who use the computer succeed in anything they do because they know how to use and understand the computer, but people who use it in the wrong ways will just be miserable because they don't know too much, they had average grades and they are unhealthy.
657	659	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are foreign to them. Computers keep people in touch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books can't, such as hand eye coordination and also about the current populations of countries and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are assigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to write essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definitely a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for communication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends alerting them of something or chat with their friends to see what's new to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to Block Island and two days before we were going to leave we received on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it weren't for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see if the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they can quickly look it up on the computer. Finally if something is unavailable in a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shipped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go against them when they benefit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world.
658	660	1	3	"The topic that is on many minds in our country is, ""Are computers beneficial, or harmful to our students?"" @CAPS1 have evolved from desktop computers, and before that, type writers, but have they gone too far? While the blank screen of a computer @MONTH1 distract some, the benefits definitely out weigh the bads in a situation like this. Being able to have faster research, easier communicating and computers in wartime are great capabilities of the modern computer. Also, due to advancement in technology, computers are very helpful because they help @LOCATION4 with our daily lives. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster, and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close by you can really make everyday life great. Out in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, soldiers rely on computers for valuable information; such as radar, or robots. Having computers do the ""dirty work"" can help in times of war, and can save valuable lives. Not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the @LOCATION4 armed forces. Computers some times take the place of humans in things such as @ORGANIZATION1's, or unmanned aerial vehicles and save many lives too. Whether it be Facebook or bombings, computers help in a vital way. It was @DATE1 and @PERSON1's communist regime was ruling new @LOCATION2. One man stood in front of a tank, resisting to move, showing courage and wanting a democracy. Fortunately, this was all caught on film. How was it broadcasted to the world? Using the computer, and internet. Today many people are able to learn about that due to computers. In many ways computers help @LOCATION4 with our daily lives and for most of @LOCATION4, without them, we would be lost."
659	661	1	3	In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether if for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends @NUM1 years of his or her life on the computer. That's a total of @NUM1 years of life waste. Most kids spend all day on the computer on @CAPS1, Facebook, @CAPS2, and YouTube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids don't realize how short life is, they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with there family, or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the hilarious video on YouTube that got over one million hits. Also, as you @MONTH1 know child obesity is on the rise, they are more overweight kids then there are then and healthy. If a you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pandemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for @NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be a lot healthier and have lost the weight I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisonous object.
660	662	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know a lot of people now a days are constantly on the computer, and many people think it’s a problem. Well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such @CAPS1 learning, entertainment, and even health. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do. The computer can help you get in contact with relatives you haven't seen in a long time. Or maybe if you have been having some health problems you can go online to see what is wrong, I remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick, and her doctor told her everything was fine, but it wasn't. So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease, and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and put her on a medicine. In my opinion the computer was one of the best inventions made. It can be used for so many things, you can also purchase items over the computer. So now I hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computer's for the many benefits they provide.
661	663	1	3	Dear Newspaper, you see, owning a computer can affect you. Having a computer can make you have lazy behavior, can keep you from being indoors, and can trap you inside so you don't hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. When you're lazy or becoming lazy you don't want to do anything, and without doing anything you can become overweight. So, you need exercise because it's good for you and exercising can protect you from health problems such as diabetes. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature possesses. Being so drawn to your computer can keep you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When you're outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for at least an hour a day you'll see for sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can distract you from what really matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are really important and if you don't spend time with them they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so don't spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun, I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, prevent you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least an hour a day they'll live a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer get off your couch, and enjoy your life.
662	664	1	3	"Technology has been growing and changing rapidly. Just look at Apple's new iPhone, a decent sized touch screen computer. Computers have been rapidly changing too. But I think that people need to cut down on the use of electronics. Being on the computer for a long time and large amount of time can damage your eyesight, give you arthritis and takes time out of exercising; one of the things many people need to do. Many people have been spending far too long on the computer, although it can be very useful it can also be very damaging to your eyesight. Many people spend large amounts of time staring at the computer screen. If you stare at something for too long it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because you're straining your eye lens. Also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes. The light coming on to your eyes is like staring at the sun but not quite as damaging. The sun will instantly damage your eyes while overtime a computer slowly damages your eyesight. If your eyesight is already damaged a computer will worsen it. The more time spent on a computer the more you damage your vision. Since your eyes are already bad you might think ""well they can't get any worse."" But the truth is they can; not only is the light and the amount of time spent being on the computer damaging to people with poor vision but even more damaging to people without. Arthritis can be genetic or common to people who constantly crack their knuckles. It can also be common to people who spend excessive amounts of time on the computer. AIM is very popular to people of all ages. It's a way to instantly gossip or chat with friends. But it takes a lot of typing. Typing too long or too much can cause your fingers to lock up and make it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain. If this constantly happens to you, you could be a candidate for arthritis. Not letting your fingers take a break can also be one of the reasons your fingers hurt; if you never let them rest they can also lock up and it can be very painful. You should spend less time on the computer if you don't want arthritis. Because of all this new technology, less people go outside and play or hit the gym and exercise. That may be why many people are over weight. Being on the computer for too long takes away time you could use to exercise or get some fresh air."
663	665	1	3	"I think that a computer is a good idea because when people are online they like to talk to their family and see them by the video cam. When you don't want to go out you can just go online and pay your bills. Like, would you like to be told to go clean your room when you are watching a movie that you like? You would say ""oh wait this movie is good."" The computer is the best system for going online; everybody uses a computer. Without a computer how are you going to check your Yahoo mail? My mom loves to be on Facebook. How are you going to check your messages if you don't have a computer? If they take computers out of stores, everybody is going to try to make one. And the people from Walmart are going to be like ""they are making more money than me"" like the people from Best Buy; they got good computers. No one is going to make people get offline. The Apple store has people who go over and buy some computers. When they are spending all their time on the computer it is because they like to be online. If I like being online you are not going to take the computers and say you are searching more on the computer. But it is all about computers; when your mom is always at your house and it is boring, you should go buy a computer when you get money."
664	666	1	3	Dear School Board, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people who use them. Because they teach hand eye coordination, give us the ability to learn about far away people and places and allow us to chat online with people. The first reason of why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that they teach hand eye coordination. For example, we need to use our hand-eye coordination skills when we type to locate the letters. This helps us increase our hand eye coordination because it helps us think about what letters we are typing, find the letters on the keyboard, and push them. Also when we type long passages it increases our hand eye coordination because we get used to writing the long paragraphs and we become more familiar with where the letters are on the keyboard and our speed increases, which means we can get more work done in a shorter time. Believe it or not, a doctor from the local hospital took a survey that showed many people who type essays instead of writing them by hand, have a greater hand eye coordination skill. Computers also allow us to learn about far away people and places. For example computers make it easier to research far away people and places. Using a computer can help us understand and learn about people and places without a trip to the library. Also computers allow us to find more info about recent events that have happened just around the world. Also computers make it faster to research topics because looking for a book in those big libraries can be stressful, not to mention difficult. Also, information on a computer can never be checked out or not available like library books. Lastly you have information right at your fingertips so you will never have to leave your house. The last reason is that computers allow us to chat online with other people. This can help us because it allows us to talk to friends and family from around the world. Also it helps us talk to our parents if they're away or if you're on a camping trip. Chatting on a computer is a great way to make friends with people you don't know and block people you don't want talking to you. So in a sense you can be in control of your friendships and who you're friends with. Computers are the greatest advance in technology since the wheel and they have helped so many people.
665	667	1	3	Dear, Local paper editors. The computers we have do benefit our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you are still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter. You could go on different websites to help you learn what you're stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called Khan Academy. It goes over what you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's two and a half years old. Isn't that amazing what computers can do. Next I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you may know. When you have computers you could talk to people that live across the country; wouldn't you want to talk to somebody long distance without paying extra money on your cell-phone? I remember one time I was talking to my dad because I had no minutes on my phone and it went great talking to him on the computer. Having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone. You could talk to a family member or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about Pythagoras for math, so I typed his name and his biography came up so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts; you could type up papers and look up different things you had to do in class. Would you want to write a five page essay and make your fingers cramp up from writing? No, so you just go on the computer and type it up without cramping your fingers. Please reconsider your opinion, cause computers can get you smarter, talk to far away people and help you with homework.
666	668	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the controversies between having computers. Computers are the center of technology, a fundamental pillar of our modern world. I can't imagine a world without them. Though having a computer @MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games, computers teach more and help children as well. I know for your company, having no computer would be a nightmare. It gives education to not only children, but adults as well. First of all, computers are proven to be the second best source of education, behind school, along with the best source of information. Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds, from history to advanced mathematics. Not only are there websites. these are @CAPS1's with online tutors or just work. Computers provide practically anything you need. For work, adult use. computers to sell something, communicate with someone, or just look up a new topic. The technology of a computer is farther than any other item. Without a computer life would be much more difficult. Instead of just sending an email, mail would have to be sent out, a much slower process. Most information would have to from brooks. In fact even the internet has books to buy and read. I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends, but children need to be social, @CAPS2 it weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities. Lastly. computers have documents and it is the best way to type. Your company can definitely agree that without typing documents life would be a mess. Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other access to typing is a type writer. Types writers can't save anything, delete and do half the work computers do. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel @CAPS2 you couldn't use a computer. In conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. Without computers life would be difficult and stressful. Computers give education stand information to everyone. The technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life, easier. I couldn't even imagire no documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my decision. I hope you chose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time.
667	669	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the Use of computers. Computers can be fun and interesting, But, people are spending to much time on the computer. @CAPS3 opinion is you should spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I also think that @CAPS2 is easy to get addicted to the computer, I should @CAPS1 I was a person that spent @CAPS3 time @NUM1 on the computer and @CAPS2 wasn't good. You should be safe on the computer because now and days @CAPS2's dangerous @CAPS2 is appalling that people spend More time on the computer than with ther own Family. Don't you agree? Well you shoud, your society, family, and friend should be the most important thing to you. You shouldn't be spending your whole day on the computer, you should be interacting with the people around you. Now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family. That shouldn't be going on. Although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you. You should think about this because this is happening to much in the world. @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS3 school say their addicted to the computer, and @PERCENT2 of the people in @CAPS3 community say their addicted to the computer too. Those are very high numbers don't you think? This is terrible and should stop going on. The computer is like a drug, you can get on the computer one time, then your just going to want to stay on ti everyday all day. The first time you get on the computer you will be addicted to @CAPS2 right away. I'm not saying you should never get on the computer, but be sure you won't get too addicted to @CAPS2 because @CAPS2 can happen very easily. @CAPS3 mother always sayed be safe on the computer"". At first I didn't really @CAPS1 what she meant, but now I @CAPS1. What ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete @CAPS2. So, you should be safe and don't put any thing on the computer if you would want anyone else to see @CAPS2. Anyone can see what you put so you should be safe. Kids are meeting people they don't @CAPS1 and try to meet them, which can be very unsafe. So you should watch out because the computer is the only place @CAPS7 you can lie. Now you should understand @CAPS7 im coming from. You should now agree with me and under stand that people should spend more time you don't get addicted and be safe, ensuring a healthier balance in life."
668	670	1	3	"Some people believe that computers are a positive effect to people, but its positive because it rots you brain. I think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature. This is why computer time should be reduced and family time increased. Absolutley, computers is the type of things that can kill brain cells if you spend to much time on it. Teenagers are the main cause of this and when they get on the computer and get on myspace and facebook they wont be learning anything and just kill major brain cells. When they go to school to take the cmts they are going to fail because they wont know anything because of the computer. Also, This is a big problem for familys because they dont hang out with each other because their always on the computer. The excuse for parents is ""@CAPS1 im on the computer"" then they never go and the children get very upset. This leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you. All it is, is cause and effect. My friends on @NUM1 has anger problems and doesn't listen to anyone all because her family never hung. Consequently, peope spend most of their time inside on the computer, you guessed right! my sister is on the computer @NUM2 and she never goes outside to enjoy the nature. People can get that @LOCATION1 were they haute to go outside and we dont want that do eve. Doctor @CAPS2 brown says everyone should go outside to just relax mostly everyday because staying in the house is not good. The computer is defeating that purpose. On the other hand, the computer is a nifty device and can be very handy at times like if your need perfect directions or need a question answered. Sometimes you just want to talk to old time friends you haven't seen in a while. Computers are good for alot of things but to much of it is not good for us lastly, i'd like to say the computer has great purpose but i think it just makes excuses for us so we dont spend time with our family, dont go outside enough to enjoy the nature, and ultimately miss out on real life."
669	671	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I felt shoeked to see that there are people that beileve that computers don't benefit society and after hearing that I felt compelled to share my opinions. They help socitey. They help us communicate, do important thing have fun. Computers help us communicate in many ways. We all want to talk to our freinds, but we can not be with our freidns all the time, so there is she internet to help us. We also all have freinds we don't see very often, but we still want to talk to them so with is intenet we can talk to them as long as we went. Computers also help us make new freinds from all over the world. They can also ehlpo us have fun. Computers are fun for many different reasons. Social networking sites, like facebook or myspace, are fun to be on. There are many fun things to do or the internet including video games, many video games consoles are attatched to the intenet so you can play with your freinds. But computers arent just all fun and games. Computers can transfer very important information including homework after schol activities, allowing for efficient collaboration. Computers also hold all of our governments information, from thingsas insignificant as plans for renovation on a town owned building to the department homeland security to the united states of without computers none of that would be possible. This should have conclude you that computers nessesary in our every day from communication, to very things computers have helped us and will to help us in the future, solidifying their role as an indispensable tool.
670	672	1	3	"Dear whomever it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I think that the effects that computers have on people is not good. I think this for a few different reasons. Those reasons are that because of them noboby goes out, people; especially students loose penmanship skills, and people loose their desire to do normal everyday things. They make us lazy!! Because of computers people don't go out. They don't go for walks because their doing something on the computer. There is now no reason for anybody to ever visit a store of any kind because you can order everything online and have it delivered right to your front door. Also, for a lot of people, they don't even have to go to work. They can work for whatever company right from their home computer. People can even finish highschool and college on their computers, by taking online courses! That brings me to @CAPS1 next reason for computers haveing a bad effect on people. Students, can now type out all assignments, some schools even give laptops to students to use throughout the year. Being able to type out everything would mean that students would barely ever have to pick up a pen or pencil, makeing their handwriting worse from lack of practice. Another way computers have a bad effect on students is because of the internet. You can find any and everything on the internet, from math books to dictionarys and other resource books. Because of this some students don't even know how to look up a word in the dictionary, let alone find needed information in a book. I think this gives students a wrong idea and sence of reality. When they go to work, not everything will be done on a computer, but this is all they are being taught to use. Lastly, people are losing their desire to do everyday things. Why go out with friends when you can talk to them online? Why go out to dinner when you can order it online? People are starting to see no point in going out and doing things because there are ""more important things"" to do on the computer. I personally think they are brain-washing us and pretty soon the world is going to be one giant computer. Based on everything I just said I don't think computers have a very good effect on effect on people. They are makeing the world a very uptight and controlled place to be and based on that selected information, I'm sure you can see why I hold this view."
671	673	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, my opinion on this is that people do use computers a lot! Some people don't care about exercising, or enjoying nature, maybe people don't even have friends so they spend a lot of their time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. For example, people or kids might have a profile on a popular social media site; they chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends. Anyways, that's my opinion. Another opinion is that I think people should not spend most of their time on the computer. I think that because people should be having fun, socializing with people, and living their life! They could be outside playing sports or just talking with others face-to-face instead of always being online. So this is what I think, my opinion about ""Computers"" is that while they are useful, we must remember to live our real lives too."
672	674	1	3	Dear Editor of the Daily Chronicle, do you think our exercising and being in nature is becoming less and less? I don't think so in my opinion. I think computers have a positive effect because they can help you connect with other people from different parts of the world. You can learn different stuff or how-to's to make life easier and be in-touch with far-away relatives. First of all, I believe computers are a positive effect because you can connect with people from different parts of the world. You can talk about their culture, about what their traditions are for marriage or other celebrations, and ask them questions about their schools and daily life. Secondly, I believe computers are a positive effect because you can learn stuff from it and how-to's to make life easier. You can find tutorials that help you understand your schoolwork better, allowing you to study more effectively. Thirdly, I believe the computer has a positive effect on communicating with far away relatives. If you haven't talked to them in a long time, you can wonder how they're doing and what their life is like, and then easily catch up with them. In conclusion, technology will basically help you in the future well. The marvelous computer will help you be in-touch with really good family and friends. Now it's time to embrace it because the fancy technology will be here for years to come!
673	675	1	3	Would you ever think that a computer can take too much time or keep you from doing lots of things? Does using a computer mess up your life in some ways? I would say no. The computer is common in life; everybody needs it or uses it in some way or form. People need it because they look up news when they could not catch it on television, so they go to the amazing technology we have, which is the world of laptops or phones with internet. This is just a natural thing in our lifestyle now; the computer does not stop you from going outside and playing. Other things, it's you who says no, I love this technology so much that I want to stay on it. So does the computer mess up someone's life in any way, or is it just you? The beautiful things a computer can do for you are numerous. A computer can do lots of things for you, so you won't want to leave it and go do other things. For instance, you have lots of homework and a project that you need information for, so you go do your work and you can also listen to music and type your project. Doing things even though you're not outside playing and being active doesn't mean that you're not doing something better for your life, like typing faster for a job when you get older and knowing how to use a computer well and not being out of touch with family; there is email. Computers have been around for a long time, and ever since this world has had them we have been smarter and more talented in most ways. Kids and adults are in touch with what's going on around us and how the world is acting. Technology has helped many people when they needed something done in a rush or for mostly everything. They have been around so that older people can still research things that they have never known and find out billions of applications for it. Although most people stay on for long periods of time, they can't stay on all day without saying hi to family and talking to them. So computers have been around for a long time and still are being used every day and always will be. So would you think that a computer is taking too much time in a person's day and they are not spending enough time with family, or is it just that computers are an all-natural thing that everybody needs?
674	676	1	3	Dear Editor, I feel like computers are good for you in a lot of ways. Like computers sometimes keep kids out of the street so they won't get in trouble. The computer has a lot of games you can play on it, so it would keep you doing something. Computers also have something called Microsoft, and Microsoft is something that helps you do writing projects and things like that. Computers help a lot of people because, like I said earlier, it has games and some of those games have to do with school subjects such as science, math, reading, and social studies, so it is very helpful. Computers are also bad for people like you because when you go on it, most teens like to go on something called Myspace. Myspace is a thing that you can have friends all around the world and can talk to them and put pics of yourself on it. If you go on Myspace and have friends from different states or the same state, you never know if they would want to find you and harm you. They would start a conversation with you, asking you for your name and where you live. Another reason it's bad is because when younger graders go to the middle school, older graders will tell them about inappropriate websites, and the little kids would go on it and will get in trouble. Well, you heard my opinion; I hope you understand my points. Thank you.
675	677	1	3	"Dear City Press, I believe that computers have a terrible impact on society. The reason I believe this is true is that kids can go ""braindead"" as some people call it. Also, kids can get obese, which is already a greatly growing problem. The last reason is that kids get bad eyesight from it. The first reason I believe that computers have a bad impact on our society is that all kids do is sit there and eat while they are on the computer, and they get an addiction to it so they just keep getting fatter because they aren't getting any exercise. This problem with children getting fat is already a very brought-up topic, and with something like this out, it's not going to get any better any time soon. Studies show that a significant percentage of kids who are on the computer more than an hour and a half a day are actually going braindead. This means that if this becomes the new trend for all kids, our next generation will not be smart and won't be able to keep up with other countries and fall behind, so we have to do something about this trend-setting issue if you want our country to stay in one piece. The last but not least reason is kids are forming bad eyesight. This can also be bad for future generations; if you let this catch on, the generation will all need glasses. It's almost like a domino effect. These are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on society: kids get obese, they go braindead, and they develop bad eyesight from it, which is a serious concern for everyone."
676	678	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think people are spending too much time on the computer and these are my reasons: less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. My first reason is less time exercising; people are too busy on the computer playing games and talking to others. Don't you think you should be outside doing some exercise like running around or playing sports instead of being in your house on the computer doing nothing? People should at least get thirty minutes of exercising. You could be on the computer for a little while but not on it all day. Take a break from the computer and go outside for a little bit; enjoy the weather and being outside. People just can't take thirty minutes away from their computer time; I find that really hard to believe. It's like the computer took over their brains and all they want to do is be on it and never get off. My second reason is enjoying nature; go outside for a little bit and see what's going on out there. Go take a walk outside in the woods and look for the animals or look for animal tracks. There are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or go fruit picking. You don't have to be inside all day and stare at the computer playing games and talking to friends. You could be outside enjoying the nice weather. People need to learn that there are better things to do with their time. My third reason is interacting with friends and family. It is important you spend time with them and see how they have been and what they have been up to. But instead, people are always too busy to talk to their family members because they are always on the computer doing stuff they don't need to be doing. There are a lot more important things in life and people need to understand that. Family is way more important than being on the computer, but people these days they put family second because they never want to talk to them or see them because they are always so busy wasting their time on the computer. Like checking your email is fine, but wasting your time on these chat things like Facebook or Twitter or Instagram is just a waste of your time; people can hang out and do things, they don't have to be on the computer asking their friends things that they should just call them and ask. Don't get me wrong, I have a Twitter account too and it takes away from your time hanging with family and other things, but I make time for it; I can hang out with friends and family and enjoy the nature and I do exercise. So I don't see why it's so hard for people to do that. So in conclusion, I think that people do waste their time on the computer too much; like I said, there are more important things in life and things you can be doing like exercising, enjoying nature, and hanging with friends and family. So I hope you take my ideas and consider them and thank you for listening to what I think. I hope people can get it through their head that they don't have to be on the computer all the time.
677	679	1	3	Could you live a day without a computer? I talk to my friends every day on the internet. I learn about current events that I wouldn't know without a computer. A computer also helps me through my daily life. I acknowledge that I should get outside and meet up with my friends, but sometimes when it's raining or snowing I just want to talk to them online. Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends at once, not just the one I am playing with. I noticed that even when my friends go away on vacation, they can still stay in touch because of their computers. Not only can you stay in touch with your friends, but you can learn about current events. Whenever I go into my web browser, my homepage comes up and shows me the current events. Without a computer I wouldn't be able to see who won last night's ball game or what's happening with the health care bill. These are important things that help me keep up with things away from my town. A computer also lets me learn more about what the healthcare bill actually is and how it affects me personally. Not only does a computer teach me about current events, it also helps me in my daily life. When I'm eating breakfast, I check my email and look at the weather forecast. During school I type up my essay assignments. When I get home I check the homework website and talk to my friends online. All of that is done on a computer. That just goes to show how much I use computers each day. I rely on my computer so much that I would be lost without it and I would get half as much done. I strongly believe that computers are a necessity. They allow me to talk to my friends when we can't meet up in person. It keeps me up to date with current news and events. I think computers have become an integral part of our daily life.
678	680	1	3	Dear Councilman, why would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting exercise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beaches? Everyone will be sitting at home on their nice new fancy computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, why would a computer solve that problem? It really doesn't. This is what I would say to having computers: people spend too much time on computers, exercise is needed every day, and it makes your body wear down and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say exercise it seems like people's minds click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, then head home to spend more time on the computer, what is that doing to your body? Not helping it. I like computers too and I like spending time on them, but when I need to get something done sometimes that doesn't happen because I get distracted and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometimes this happens to people; they are engaged in their computer when someone is talking to them and you're telling them something you need them to do, and they're nodding their head like they know what you said, but the next time you ask if it got done and it didn't, you know they weren't listening. Exercise is really important for your body and doesn't even have to be hard to get anything from it, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to many individuals or families when they come home from work or school and jump right on the computers; families are not getting enough exercise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Exercise would help to keep you healthy instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body; it sucks the life out of you. It strains your eyes and it makes you weak and you really don't want to do a lot; maybe if people spent less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they wouldn't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who don't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodies more focused; from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. I hope you understand why I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities then you would say that computers are not a lot of help also.
679	681	1	3	Dear Editor, today I am going to inform you that more and more people are using computers than spending time with their family. I agree with the effects computers have on people because one, it allows us to access information; two, it allows us to interact with people; and three, because it helps us stay updated on what is happening in sports or everything else. My first reason why we should use computers is because it gives us information, like the weather reports, school openings, delays, and closings. It also tells us how Japan has been after the earthquake. It tells us a lot of stuff. It allows us to go to other websites to find information too. And it allows us to have fun and play games on the internet. It can help us on our homework. And it can help us find things like jobs and other stuff. My second reason why we should use computers is because we can interact with people. We can talk to people we've never ever met before. We can find information about them and they can tell us how their life is a little. It can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can catch them. It is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them. And it can make people have fun which will make them stay on the computer for a long period of time. My third reason why we should use computers is because it would keep us updated on sports and for those who love to watch it would tell us the most recent news on teams and players. And if you are a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer. And we can be able to post about games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans. In conclusion, this is why we should use computers: because it can give us information all over the world; two, it can allow us to interact with people we've never met before; and three, it will keep us updated on sports we like to catch, especially if you're a sports fanatic.
680	682	1	3	With more and more people using computers, I think that this does not benefit society. I think this because more cases of suicide are from online bullying, people get so addicted that they don't exercise and become obese, and because it is bad for the environment. Now more than ever before people are bullying, but not just shoving kids around like they used to. Now the bullies found a new way, by starting web pages, emailing the person, or making threats online. With the internet people say things that they wouldn't be able to say in person because you don't have to see face to face all the time. Did you know that a significant percentage of all teenage suicides are from being bullied online? The bullies get into that person's head and cause them to hurt themselves because they let people get to them. If we didn't have as many people going online then the youth would be more protected from online predators. As you sit on the computer and play games or talk to friends, you are most likely sitting still. Well, when you eat and stay on the computer you aren't exercising. Well, more than half of obese people say they don't exercise because they are either too tired or don't have enough time. Of course you are going to be tired if you sit for a couple hours staring at a computer screen. When they say they don't have time but yet they spend an hour a day on the computer, that doesn't make much sense to me. Obesity has become a big concern; it is a main cause of health problems. People need to get active. The environment is a big concern these days, with toxic waste, the ozone layer, and skin cancer on the rise. But how does the computer affect this? Well, computers use energy and let out toxins for the environment, killing the ozone layer and the effects are much more powerful, hurting people. Yes, plants do help the ozone layer but when you print you use paper and it is very hard to keep up with the demand of paper and the demand of the animals who have to eat, but without trees and plants, what do they eat? By the time our children's children are here, there may be little to no wildlife left, barely any wilderness, and without the ozone layer many people will die of skin cancer, all because we are so addicted to using the computers. People's lives, health, and the environment are all big issues that computers help to destroy. How would you feel walking into your child's bedroom seeing them on the floor dead from being bullied on the computer? Or see a loved one suffer from heart problems due to obesity because they couldn't get off the computer? Or in about fifty years the ozone layer is completely destroyed due to the computers, with little to no wildlife left? Using computers does not benefit society. Sure, it's a quick look up, but so are books. The computer has everything a local library has. People need to stop being lazy and get out. Put a stop to suicides, obesity, and hurting the environment.
681	683	1	3	Do you ever have time to read a good book? Do you ever spend quality time with your family? Or do you ever have time to go outside and enjoy the fresh air? Well, if you don't, it's likely because you spend too much time on the computer. Computers are bad for society, and I will show you why. There are many great activities you can do such as reading a physical book. Instead of reading on the computer screen, read a novel; you can ask your parents to drive you to the local library. I understand that if you need to do research you can do it on the computer, but in the library there are all sorts of books such as fiction, nonfiction, science books and many more. Every intelligent citizen would acknowledge that computer websites often have wrong information. I remember when I was doing a school project on a famous singer, a legend of pop music. I used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her. I went to the library and checked out a biography on her and it said that a woman killed her actually. In addition, library books help you get more accurate and verified facts. Every caring, loving human cares about spending time with their family. How can you spend more time with your family? Well, you can visit some cousins on the weekends. Your family can make parties and gatherings. I recall having a big party for my baby brother's baptism, everyone came to our house. I got to see my aunts, and cousins that I didn't see in years. I understand that if you have a far away relative you would use the computer to chat with them or see them on webcam, but why not take a vacation where they live and go by car? That would bring the family even closer together. I know what that is like from personal experience. My family lives in another state and I visit them every summer. We have family reunions, maybe your family can do that too. As a result, family is important, so don't let the computer ruin yours. Do you ever go outside anymore? Is the computer getting in your way? You have to check your e-mail, reply to messages, go on your social media, its hungry for attention, you have to do your daily digital activities. What about your physical health? Getting fresh air can be good for you. These are many great things you can do outside. For example, you can jump rope, go to the park, go swimming, play in the snow and many more. I remember the time my cousin came over and we went to the park. We stayed there until the park closed for the evening. It was very entertaining and fun. Every citizen in our community wants to be healthy. Going outside can help you, run through the woods, or even jump roping is outside and excellent excersizing. In addition just going outside for a walk can do more for your mood. Now is the time to make a change. Why wait another minute? You can either be all alone on the computer or be outside, or be with your family, even the library isn't a lonely place. Computers are a bad habit, even though we might need them for some tasks, its better safe, then sorry to do it the old fashion way sometimes.
682	684	1	3	Dear Newspaper, It has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate about the issue stating that not everyone agrees that computers benefit society. I can't understand why anyone would think that. Computers present many oppurtunities for people in their daily lives. They allow for people to communicate with each other easily, they allow people to research topics in a simpler and faster way, and they teach valuable hand-eye coordination skills. This is why I strongly agree that computers do benefit society greatly. In the modern world, nearly all businesses rely on fast and efficient communication. Many people in those businesses use not only phones to communicate, but computers as well for email and video calls. Online communication is a fast, simple, and effective way for people to communicate whether someone is at home or at work. This is one significant way computers benefit all of society today. Nobody knows everything, we are always trying to find out about new things that we never knew before. Sometimes we might use books for this, but the way most people use now is online researching. This is because not only is it quicker, but simpler as well to find what you need. When you research online, the information literally comes to you on the screen. All you do is type a subject into a search engine. This easy access to knowledge is another reason why computers do benefit society so much. The final reason is that computers teach and improve hand-eye coordination. This shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer you realize that typing becomes easier and more natural. It might take a while to learn, but over time people get the hang of using the mouse and keyboard efficiently. In a way, the computer is letting you teach yourself these useful motor skills. Some people would say that people spend too much time on computers. This isn't a real problem though because people often have to spend long periods of time on computers in order to do the beneficial things that computers have to offer, like work or learning. In conclusion, you can see that I have clearly stated the major benefits of computers. They allow us to communicate with anyone, research any topic, and improve our hand-eye coordination for other tasks. This is why computers do benefit society and are a positive force in our world.
683	685	1	3	In this modernized world computers are key to daily life. They offer many benefits that enclude global communication, digital enterntainment, and an accessible education. These benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why I support the continued advances in technology. Communication is a large benifit with computers in the current era. Whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing important business meetings computer offer a large amount of aid and convenience. With the modern technology that is provided with the computer, people can instantly send messages to co-workers or friends in a matter of seconds from anywhere. In some cases businesses completly relie on the computer to function properly; for example, to have conversation with people accross the globe to discuss how they are going to expand internationaly into new markets. Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate effectively and enable people to make plans with simply and efficiently. The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment for all ages. With the internet the computer provides the users with websites that enable them to talk to friends, watch funny videos, play interactive games, and more activities. The computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or a rainy-day when you are stuck indoors. The computer enables people to stay entertained, and relaxed when needed after a long day. The most important function of the computer is perhaps in education for students. The computer supplies the user or student with a wide variety of information on any subject. The computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that might be brought up in a class room discussion or assignment. It comes to be very useful for research projects or even learning another language through online programs. The computer is a very beneficail tool when it comes to education and expanding one's knowledge. The computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple and more connected. It has come to be incorperated with almost any daily task that might occur during the day, from shopping to studying. It would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder that helps so many. The computer is a technology that greatly benifits our communication with others, our entertainment options, and even our education for a brighter future.
684	686	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I would like to speak upon the topic of the effects that computers have on people today. My opion on this topic is that computers do have a significant effect on people, often a negative one. Most people while surfing the internet don't keep track of time properly. What I mean when I say most people lose track of time is that, they try to keep track of the time but while on the web something interesting might pop up that catches their intrest and at that same time there focus is on something else entirely. Some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them inside the house all day. When many people are on the web they tend not to excersise as much as they should. When in the house on the web most people that used to excersise stop excersising regularly. The reason why this occurs is because while people are on the computer chair you feel so relaxed and calm that you don't want to get up and move around. This often leads into eating unhealthy foods while sitting at the screen. Some common snacks such as chips, donuts, twinkies and etc. are consumed. Some individuals do not believe that this is a serious opinion. The reason I say this is because while watching television the other day I saw a commercial that said quote ""People that are more active are healthier than people that stay on the computer all day."" Most individuals do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active enough. Not being physically active can lead to A) obesity B) cloged arteries or C) lazyness. It can lead to all three because those are the common effects of being on a computer every day of the week. Most people should be enjoying nature outside instead of staying on the computer indoors. There is a lot more to life than being on the web all the time. Some activities such as playing sports are better for you. Not only is playing sports fun but at the same time it is also healthy for your body. Would you rather live to be an old age or live a shorter life? And so local newspaper that is why I am writing you this letter today to express my concern. I mean would you rather have real friends or be lonely by yourself? There are weight surgerys available but those can rack up to thousands of dollars in medical bills. And yes weight loss surgery does have serious effects such as potential death. So come on everyone its your decison and remember the most important part of this letter which is between liveing healthy and young or dieing unhealthy and suffer. Its your choice to make so decide wisely for your future."
685	687	1	3	Computers are a good benefit to society because they allow you to talk to people and give different options for you to get the latest updates. First they allow you to chat with friends online; they allow you to message anytime you want, day or night. You can talk to people who live faraway that you might otherwise lose touch with. For example, if your friend lives on the other side of the globe you and your computer can message so you can still talk to them all the time without long distance charges. Also when your bored it will give you something fun to do. You could see if anyone wants to make plans to hangout in person. And if you just want to stay home all day you can still interact with people through social media. Secondly it gives you new ideas on things you are interested in. It shares many different oppions from around the world. Maybe someone bought the same product and it did not work well; you could see the comments and review before purchasing. Would you want to spend you money on some thing that did not work properly? I certainly woudn't want to waste my money. You can also see if the majority of people like what they got from a store. Also they make you think of something you would not think about before; say you had a poor mark on a paper about how this was horrible, maybe if you read a similar page online it shows what you did wrong and what you did not do correctly. It gives you the chance to try something new that you might enjoy once you get the hang of it. Lastly it gives you the latest updates instantly; it can share if the school sched is closed, delayed, or open. You wouldn't have to wait for the news to show it on television. It can tell you about crimes that are happening in your neighborhood. Also it tells you about events in your town. Who dont want to know whats going on in your own community? It tells you about new things that are in your town or what their going to make or it tells you what it is getting rid of from the area. Computers are helpful in a lot of ways; they let us chat with friends and family far away. It gives us thoughts we might have never thought about before and they tell us the newest updates as they happen.
686	688	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, With all due respect to anyone that thinks the computer doesn't benefit society, I strongly disagree. Yes, there are many people that neglect other activities to be on the computer, and yes, the computer is an invention that a lot of people depend on, but the computer is also an invention that we can benefit from in many positive ways. For example, @CAPS1' @PERSON1, a hip-hop artist with millions of fans, wasn't able to finish high school or go to college because of his career. He decided to get a college degree, so he started to attend a college. He had difficulty being in college, however, because he was constantly being harassed by his fans, so he started going to college online. That way, he was able to focus on his studies and get his degree without the harassment, demonstrating the computer's power to overcome physical barriers to education. The computer also has websites on the internet that are used in schools. They help teach students in a way that they will have fun and enjoy what they're doing, giving them a better learning experience through interactive lessons and educational games. Aside from the positive uses of the internet, the computer also contains programs that can benefit us just as well. Microsoft @CAPS2, for example is a program on the computer that is used to create @CAPS2 documents such as poems, essays, song lyrics, and even letters. You can print out these @CAPS2 documents to have a copy of your own to keep and show people wherever you go, but if you're not finished, it can be saved on your computer for later editing. People use the computer for many things, books, movies and so on. Over the years that it's been in existence, it's benefited us a lot. What do you think? It is clear that the computer offers significant advantages that enrich our lives in numerous ways.
687	689	1	3	"Suppose you have a family member that you have not seen in a long time and you dont have enough money to visit them because they live too far? Or you are injured or sick and you have nothing to do, so you decide to just browse the internet and you actually learn some interesting things like what new organism has scientist found out or something in history you've never known before? Amazingly, the computer is filled with knowledge like this. You could talk to family members you haven't seen before or just haven't got the chance to see them in a long time. You could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside. And just so you know more, I'll even tell you about these things. I have a half sister who I only get see like once a year or once two years. But the only way I get to interact with her is on facebook. There is also websites people use to talk to loved ones like twitter, myspace, yearbook, aim, skype ect. Not only do you just talk to them you could do a webcam chat, so you could also see them, making the conversation much more personal and real. Alot of people use webchat to talk with old friends. While on the computer you could also learn new things. Yesterday, when I was on the computer I got bored and did some random searching, and in that @NUM1 min. I learned things I never heard about, like the ""@CAPS1 massacre"" and that time when a teacher went into a spaceship for the first time and it blew up with the teacher in it. Man was that a tragedy! If you were interested in nature you could learn about all kinds of nature around the world, from deep-sea creatures to rare jungle plants. Also, if you are interested in ancient time with a few typing you got all kinds of fascinating things of ancient time like @PERSON1, the city that was forgotten, then found. I'm pretty sure you couldn't learn that kind of stuff stepping outside. The amazing things a computer could do! Talking with family and friends you haven't seen in which to be decades and learning fascinating things. Usually it's cool because you could learn things your teacher never knew. Would you want the teacher teaching you or you teaching the teacher! It truly opens up a world of connection and discovery right at your fingertips."
688	690	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers do benefit society. People are able to read, shop, and play online. This makes life easier for many people. Buying books that you would like to read can get expensive. With the internet, people are able to read almost any book right on their computer. In a recent survey, it was found that people who read books online save an additional @MONEY1 a year more than people who buy books. People can also read things like newspaper online. If there is snow on the ground, and people are unable to get their newspaper, they can read it online. This way they will know if a newspaper is still good, and continue buying it, including the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Additionally, people are able to shop online. Sometime, someone @MONTH1 have been an accident injuring them, and they are stuck at home. If it is a child, their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child. They can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them. People can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school. @PERSON1, a physician, told me that people who shop online have @PERCENT1 less stress than people who go to the store for the same items. He said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop. Moreover, the computer is a good way to quietly play games. Young children can be very loud and energetic. Parents can just let them play games and read on the computer. Little kids love just the fact of being on the computer, and letting them go on can keep them quiet and occupied for a while. Even just typing is interesting for younger kids. For older kids, there are many games that can play. Action, strategy, puzzles, and many more. They can also play against people around the world. The computer is fun for everyone. So in conclusion the computer is a very good place to go shopping, read books, and play games. Computers greatly help families of today by providing convenience, savings, and entertainment.
689	691	1	3	My opinion on the effects computer have on people. A good effect that computer have on people is that it teaches them how to have good hand-eye coordination @CAPS1 if they work as a doctor on anything that needs it that would help them do better in their jobs. Another reason why computers have good effects on people is it let them chat with their family members case if your family went to a whole new countries for a trip then you be able to see how there doing and it's like there with you through video calls. Another one would be that you could learn about another states and countries around the world. It tell you how many people like there and what type of culture they have when it found probably now when I want to learn about texas I look up information on it and tell me when it was found the capital and how many people live there. Another good thing is that you could play games with your friends like all types shooting games racing sport arcade all type, which helps with teamwork and having fun together even when you are apart. These benefits show how computers can positively impact our skills, relationships, and knowledge.
690	692	1	3	I don't think that computers is the most positive effect. Because most computer's are not like that the computers are not the smartest but it does help you when you need to do something like a project when you have to look for pictures and when you need help with math you can use the calculator on the computer but the computer does not help you on all your subject's the computer only help's you on a couple of your subject's that is the main reason I use the computer. Sometimes when I'm doing homework I let the computer do it for me so it is easier for me to do and I look for website's on it they give you really good website's that is why mostly everyone use's the computer they mostly use the computer to look for job's, car's, or a house that is what they mainly use the computer for most people do not like using the internet because they think it's cheating to use the computer for schoolwork. However, its utility in research and daily tasks cannot be denied, even if its assistance is limited to certain areas.
691	693	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In one's opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days, the effects that computers have on people are that they can benefit us in many ways. For example, they can facilitate communication with people around the world; many people @MONTH1 have friends or family that live in another state or country, and computers can help us communicate with them through video calls and instant messaging. Computers allow us to help us learn what we couldn't learn from books alone, providing access to dynamic and updated information. Computers can help us with learning about complex subjects such as demographics or the population of different countries. One might think that traditional methods are good, but they are slow; with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply almost instantly. Computers have benefited society in many ways, and in one's opinion about them is that they can benefit us in many ways we wouldn't think of being possible. Before computers and printers became widespread, we had to use typewriters, and if you made a mistake you would have to start the page again, a process that could take hours of work to get the paper perfect. But with the modern world's technology, we don't have to type a whole paragraph over again if we make a mistake; we can just hit the backspace button on the keyboard so it won't take us hours to type one page, perhaps only half an hour at most. So computers have benefited us in more ways than we often realize. Therefore, in one's opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit us is that they allow us to do things we couldn't have done before the computer was invented. The computer was a great invention and it has benefited mankind as we speak, and it is not that hard to set up for basic use. So in one's opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in is that they also benefit mankind as a whole by enhancing our capabilities and connecting our world.
692	694	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benefit society very much. I believe so for various reasons that I will state throughout this passage. Although sometimes people spend too much time on a computer, it doesn't mean computers are bad for society; it just means people need to learn to spend their time wisely and maintain a healthy balance. Overall I think computers have a positive effect on society. One reason I am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology, representing a significant leap forward for humanity. They are able to make everyday life easier by automating tasks and providing quick access to information. They allow you to store vast amounts of information securely, learn about many places through virtual tours and databases, and communicate with friends and family across great distances. For one device to do all that is truly amazing! Also, if we can create something as complex as computers, it makes one imagine all the other possibilities of future technology advancements. Computers are only the start of it all, paving the way for further innovation. Another reason why I believe computers greatly benefit society is because they provide a wide range of entertainment options. You can watch movies on your computer, download fun games, and explore creative hobbies. There is hardly anything you can't do on a computer when it comes to leisure. If it is cold outside or raining, you can still entertain yourself with just a computer, making it a valuable resource for indoor activities. Computers are very great to have around for these purposes. Now, anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computer and that computers are bad for society is just wrong in my view. I think those people are wrong because a computer can't force you to spend more time on it; it is an inanimate tool. It's your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much and neglect other aspects of life. You always have the choice to go outside and take a walk or engage in other activities. Computers are only wrong if you choose to use them wrong, much like the expression ""guns don't kill people, people do,"" which highlights that responsibility lies with the user, not the tool. In conclusion I believe computers are a great thing to have especially in this modern society where digital literacy is important. Computers are one of the greatest advancements in technology and they benefit society as well by improving efficiency and connectivity. So if you are ever wondering whether or not to buy a computer I suggest you get one to experience these benefits for yourself!"
693	695	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons for my answer is that there are many homework helper websites, the computer helps you learn about places you've never been to, and you can even interact with people all around the world. These are my three reasons on why I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get tutored at any time of day. I remember in @NUM1 grade when I had a math midterm approaching. I was having a hard time understanding the math concepts being taught in class. Then, I went on a tutoring website and they taught me everything that I was having trouble with through interactive lessons and practice problems. I think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades by providing this accessible academic support. This is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Second, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn about far away places that you have never been to before through videos, maps, and articles. This would be useful for a school project on a country, allowing for a more immersive learning experience. Also @PERCENT1 of students in my school say that the computer has helped them a lot on school projects by making research faster and more comprehensive. The computer could also be useful for planning a vacation, helping you choose the best destinations. Would you want to vacation to a place that you know nothing about? That is where the computer can help immensely. All you have to do is search your destination and pictures and info will come up so you can make the right choice about your travels. This is my second reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think computers have a positive effect on people because you can interact with people around the world through social media and communication platforms. I have a brother that lives in Florida, but I can talk to him every day on the computer via video chat, which makes the distance feel smaller. Also, I can keep in touch with my friends anytime I want, strengthening our relationships. I think computers help people develop better social skills by allowing them to connect with diverse individuals. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think computers have a positive effect on people by helping them achieve better grades, learn different things about the world, and talk to friends and family easily, thereby enriching their lives.
694	696	1	3	Dear editor of The @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good ideas for our community for several practical reasons. If the library's closed and a student needs information for a project, you can look it up on the internet quickly and conveniently. Also, you can talk with your friends if your phone is not working, using various communication applications. Computers can help people learn about the latest news if the television is getting pixelated or broken, ensuring you stay informed. First of all, computers can help with research a lot, providing access to countless databases and educational resources. Let's say it's raining heavily, your car is out of gas, and you need to go to the library before it closes for a book. It would just be easier to go on the computer and find a research site about your topic; no gas is wasted, no getting soaking wet, just you in a robe sipping hot chocolate while researching on the computer comfortably. Next, you can talk to friends all the way in another country without having to pay extra for a long distance call, which can be very expensive. And if you don't have unlimited minutes on your phone plan and you want to talk with someone for a long time, you'd be wasting valuable minutes and money! This is where computers come in as a cost-effective solution. You can just open a chat window and talk away for hours, just like that, using internet-based calling services. Finally, you can look up the latest news and information on a search program, like @ORGANIZATION1, to get real-time updates on current events. If your television broke and it'd take a week to fix, what if something important happened that you needed to know about? You could just go on the internet and look it up immediately, staying connected to the world. Thank you for reading my ideas, editor. I hope you'll choose my article to post in your newspaper when the time comes to share these benefits with the community.
695	697	1	3	"Fairfield @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers have a bad effect on people? Many people say ""yes"" and many say ""no,"" but in my view, @CAPS3 a matter of fact, computers @CAPS2 have a bad effect. People are very easily distracted on computers, it wastes valuable time, and it causes significant stress. Many kids who @CAPS2 their homework on computers are very easily distracted from their studies. With computers comes the internet, and with the internet comes games and social networking sites that are designed to be engaging. Many kids would rather chat on facebook with a friend than @CAPS2 homework using an online book... including me, I must admit. When I get home, I start using the online text book for my math class with the intention to work. But when I wait for it to load I get bored and go on an online game website almost automatically. After that I get too distracted on this addicting game called ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1."" And after @NUM2 hours of playing online games I realized I have wasted a lot of time that I cannot get back. I realized I have been wasting a lot of my math homework time lately with those online distracting games, which has impacted my academic performance. And since @PERCENT1 of my grade in math is based on homework, I've gone from a @CAPS4 to a @CAPS5+, which is very concerning. And why waste time on the computer when there are other activities? Outdoors are just @CAPS3 fun @CAPS3 playing games like ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1."" I'd rather be playing football with my friends than that dumb computer game, as it promotes physical health and real social interaction. My parents have also realized that I've been wasting so much time on the computer that they've blocked the internet to help me focus. But distracting games that waste time also cause stress, which could be fatal in extreme cases. Imagine being in the hospital because of playing on the computer, which sounds unbelievable but has happened. Once while I was watching the @ORGANIZATION1, a news report said @NUM4 people died because of playing on the computer for over @NUM2 days with little food or water, highlighting the serious risks. My parents also notice that me and my brother are grumpy and irritable after playing on the computer for so long, showing the negative mood effects. And I've been stressed lately about my grades and time management, which I link to my computer use. Overall, computers have a bad effect on people when used excessively. Distracting games are a waste of time and cause stress, affecting both mental and physical health. Hopefully people understand this message and you shouldn't play on computers for too long to avoid these negative consequences."
696	698	1	3	Dear who it may concern, I think that computers are very effective but then again they are not because would you rather have your kids on the computer or, let's say, some children smoke and some hang out in the streets too much; yeah, it does do a lot of effect to them. In my prediction, I say computers are very addictive but then again it really isn't because there are some people who really don't like being on the computers for a long time 'cause it gets boring and it starts to hurt your eyes. I will understand if they don't want to get off when it passes their bedtime. Some kids do a lot of bad things out in the street and hang out in the streets a lot, but when they go on the computer it can stop some of them from doing those things. A lot of kids have Myspace and Facebook and more, and it is the best way to stay in contact with your family and friends; that's one of the main reasons kids go on. And there are other electronic devices that stop kids from exercising and stuff like that, such as a PSP Go or Xbox 360, or DS, DSi, PlayStation 3 and 4. So I think it is an addiction and it affects kids, but the things you'd rather have your kids do keeps them away from doing it, so it is a difficult choice to make.
697	699	1	3	"Dear Scientific Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our society's advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of the future are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from Canada to Australia, to Japan to Germany, they are being used. People from ages of school kids to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines, and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the 1980s, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to receive new information in is just astonishing! John Smith, a computer engineer, says ""With the technology that we receive from computers, we are able to be in the game."" This statement just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information; however, it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occurred sometimes as close to 24 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to ""be in the game."" You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball as it flies high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have ""hand-eye"" coordination. Hand-eye coordination is perhaps one of the most necessary aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in its sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that 8 out of 10 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis-balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers state, your eyes are freely tracked on the screen and you train your hands to maneuver about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing to catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like the amazing point-guard Steve Nash; the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money may be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that ""rich."" I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as $1000 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us $20 each. Not only do computers stand to last 10 years longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up-to-date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up costing more in the long-run. Our neighboring society of Springfield just invested in over 200 computers for their society. They stated that it took only 18 months to get the money back that they had spent on the computers with the amount that they saved by not purchasing books! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after 5 years! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand-eye coordination but we invest in more money for the future. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to receive information instantly from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them we just might be less than the rest. Dreams of incredible rockets and medicines and cures for diseases just won't happen. Computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, in the long-run, the decision is yours to make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands."
698	700	1	3	"Dear Newspaper; I believe that computers are good for our society. There are many reasons as to why I believe this. One reason is that it makes life easier; it also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers how would we talk with people without phones and spread news? Computers make life easier by many ways. For example, if you needed a doctor's permission to play a sport, it would be a lot easier to send him/her an email telling him/her to send you an email saying you can play; you can show it to the sports team and they will allow you to play. We can also learn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and go to a news website and look at the weather so we can make plans for the day. We can find the newest technology like an ""iPhone"" or a ""Samsung Galaxy"". There are some people in the world that don't have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the air force and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't allow phones. Also if there is a person with good news and they want to tell a lot of people, they can send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I believe computers are a good thing to have in our society. I have shown that they make life easier. It also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world. I hope you agree on my topic and see the value they bring."
699	701	1	3	School Board, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. There is however a growing concern about whether it's beneficial or not? People become more lazy because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what mankind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked Dr. James of the Education Department about the concern. He says that it can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make PowerPoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essays. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend Sarah said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of PowerPoints etc. I miss my family over in England. I want to see them, not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them and basically see them. I asked 50 people if they prefer using a computer to talk to their family or use a phone. 40 out of 50 said they prefer the computer. I know I'm trying to say they are great but they do have their down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online games make it even more fun, thus it makes them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible, says Mrs. Peterson of the Parents Association. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games, I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true and that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
700	702	1	3	My opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you but people should not use the computer a lot because people should exercise, interact with family, and enjoy nature. Exercising is more important than a computer because it will make you healthy; you will not be sick so much. Interacting with family is more important than a computer because the internet may help you have a friend but not a family; your family helps you when you need help, and maybe that friend on the computer is not real; that is why it is important to interact with family. And the last thing that is more important than a computer is enjoying nature. It is fun because you are not bored. You are outside; you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying yourself so much. My opinion is that computers should only be used to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out on the computer, so we maintain a healthy balance in our lives.
701	703	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are a great help to society and I will explain my thoughts and ideas to you. I hope you agree with me after reading this. For starters, I would like to say that my first subject is communication, as computers allow us to talk to everyday folks or folks that are around the world! There are many ways to talk, including text, speech, and webcam, and it is not like you cannot talk to them; there are hundreds of communication clients and servers online usually, so you will always be able to connect to someone! Secondly, I would like to say computers have a great way of creation. On a computer you can program, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs; almost anything you put your mind to can be virtually made. You can gather information from servers, websites, and other sources, and you can create and learn a lot on your everyday computer. I am not finished! There are also numerous reading and book sites all on the web! This gives the opportunity for the ""web searcher"" to have a vast amount of information and allows him or her to learn a lot more in everyday life. Finally, I would like to say that computers have a wide range of entertainment! There are many options to choose from like videos, movies, music, games—anything that is suitable for the user or users of the computer. In a game, a user can talk to friends while playing a game such as an online role-playing game for example. These kinds of games skyrocket entertainment for lovers of fun due to the vast amount of enjoyment they can experience while playing. Another type of entertainment is videos; people can watch videos and movies on a video website which has a database of not thousands but millions of videos and movies. Whatever the user wants is a text and a click away! The last type of entertainment is social media and music, which allow the user to share daily life or talk to friends, family, or relatives. To sum this all up, I would like to tell you, Local Newspaper, that you should agree that computers are a good thing for society! Please reread and pick the right choice."
702	704	1	3	Dear Editor, I think this is a good idea because you can play games and talk to family or friends and listen to music. My first reason is playing games. When you are bored and there's nothing to do, all you can do is go on the computer and play all kinds of games like car games, shooting games, and arcade games too. You can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer. My second reason is talking to friends or family. If your brother or sister or any of your family members live in a different state and you want to talk to them or see them, then all you have to do is ask them for their email address, and then if they have a Myspace or Facebook you could talk to them as long as you want. You can also talk to your friends on those websites too. My third reason is listening to music. You can also listen to music on your computer by going to a music website or by downloading a program like Frostwire or something similar. You can listen to all kinds of music like hip-hop, rap, rock, or heavy rock. If you want to listen to any song, you're going to need the song's name and sometimes the artist's name too. This is the idea I think they should consider and the option they should pick.
703	705	1	3	What is more fun, staring at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beautiful nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and a large percentage of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much better than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, you should talk to them in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, a lot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spare time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were made for people, but have you thought for one second that instead of interacting with people online you should interact with the people around you? Instead of going on Facebook or Myspace to talk to your friends, just invite them over. If you do that it's not only more fun, it's healthier for you. So next time, consider the other options. In my last paragraph, didn't I say that hanging out with friends is much healthier than being on the computer? Well, I was absolutely right! Did you know that when you waste your time you are only hurting yourself? Well, you are; when all you're doing is sitting down staring at a screen you are not doing anything to help yourself because you are getting absolutely no exercise. When you're not on the computer you are at least walking a little bit, but typing doesn't do anything for you. That's why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet predator? Well, let me just sum it up for you. An internet predator is someone that uses the computer to get people they don't know to do inappropriate things. And did I mention it was against the law, because it is. So if you ignore this advice, bad things could happen. And that's just one of the reasons why people shouldn't spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldn't spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, there are internet predators. So the next time you open your laptop, just think: is it more fun staring at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beautiful nature with friends and family? And always remember what the better choice is.
704	706	1	3	Computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people learn about news in the world, places, and people. Computers can also help people communicate with each other. Computers can also teach hand-eye coordination. People who support advances in technology believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things as easily. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about a foreign country. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I went on the computer and looked it up. It told me where the country was located. Then it showed me a picture of the country, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fascinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of what they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper; on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world. Without computers people could not learn as efficiently. On computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away. Scientists did a study on how people communicate. A significant percentage of respondents said they used a computer to communicate with other people. People can use a webcam, instant messaging, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family abroad I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or instant messaging. Writing letters is too slow; on a computer the other person you're talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye coordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye coordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you are dribbling or you will fall. Computers can give people fast reflexes and help people in sports. Computers should be part of society's everyday life. Computers have a positive effect on people and they can help people learn new things, like places, people, and news in the world. Computers are very beneficial to society.
705	707	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you because I believe that people in the community overuse computers these days. I think that instead of staying home on your lazy chair and playing Farmville and other games on Facebook you should get out more. I think that you should go to the gym and work out; you should go out to the park or have family fun night with your kids, if you have any. The last thing I think you should do is have a little ""me"" time; for example, take yourself somewhere nice. For a long time, all you've done is sit home playing Farmville and other games, and you probably get really sluggish, and are you eating right? Well, if you are not careful, you will have gained some pounds over time and you will look like you need to get yourself to a gym. From sitting on your chair while on the computer every day you aren't burning any calories or fat, and when you eat all you're doing is gaining weight, and you probably don't want to. Do you have a family? Well, if you do, I think that taking a family trip to the park would be fun or going to a community center would be a fun way to get your hands off those keys and your head back with your kids. Also, you should make another night a family fun night and play games and hang out with family; on family fun night you can play charades or a board game, as long as you don't have a computer in your house. The last one, my favorite, is ""Me"" Time. During ""Me"" Time you can take yourself shopping, go out to lunch or dinner, or even take a nap; the whole point of ""Me"" Time is that you do not go on the computer! You need to relax and just take a break. Well, those are my suggestions to you. It is now your turn to jump on out of the virtual world and put your head back in reality."
706	708	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers are an amazing advantage to use in this modern day and age. They are easy to learn how to use, you can connect with old friends, and even learn by going to an online school or college they offer. Computers are an amazing advancement and this is why you should use one. Who doesn't like computers? They are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms, from desktops to lightweight laptops and tablets. Almost every college student has a computer or laptop. They could have never used one before, but then they learned how easy it was. Most computers come already installed with the necessary programs including: @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or some form of @CAPS2, a virus protection software, and other simple software for writing and organizing your files. Moving is very hard, you leave a place where you have so many friends to a place that is so new to you. Computers make this so much easier by letting you connect with them without having to wait for the mail by writing letters. There is email, facebook, and myspace that let you chat with old friends, new friends, or even parents through instant messages and video calls. Some people say that these things are dangerous, that is only if you start talking to people you don't know. People keep coming up with even more ways to stay connected so don't miss out on the opportunity. These people are so smart, they figured out a way to have school online. This is very helpful to somebody who is injured or is trying to get another degree to get a better job. People get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months, allowing for a flexible schedule. People get to do their job or enjoy nature still because their day is open and not busy with a rigid class timetable. Sure people don't get to enjoy the campus, but with the price of gasoline these days, it's worth it. So don't be the person sitting around doing nothing, buy a computer and stay in touch with technology. Remember computers are easy to use, you can stay connected to friends and you can go to school on them. This technology can help you more than it can hurt you, opening up a world of possibilities right at your fingertips.

Statistic proved that @CAPS2 you know how to use a @CAPS1 you a higher opurtunity that a wage higher than the avage you would received when you do not know anything about @CAPS1. Another statistic should that @CAPS2 you know and use computers you would live longer and happier due to better job satisfaction. @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 student agreed that his friend have better jobs @CAPS2 they know how to use computers.

708	710	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Are computers a bad thing? Certainyly not! They can be distracting but in a enlighting way. How? Computers give you extra knowledge, you can connect with people and if you think they take away exercise, they do not, they can actually help exercise! My first reason that computers are a positive device to have is they can give you extra knowledge. That is great for the brain! When you are sitting at home with a ton of questions, think again, the computer is there for you. Ask or search anything and you should have a @PERCENT1 guarentee your answer will be found on a search engine or an online encyclopedia! If you feel like you do not know many interesting subjects like a culture of some sort or something that you heard your computer can tell you. Just one computer can enlighten you with so much information on history, science, and art. Now when you go back to school you can brag and say ""@CAPS1 you know,?"" People will be amazed. Lately experts have been concerned that the computer device is a distracting item and it will keep you from exercising and enjoying nature, @CAPS2, no need to worry you can learn just nabcur anything on nature when you surf the web! You @MONTH1 find out more of what is in your maryard then you already knew, identifying birds and plants. Exercise! Are you worried you do not get enough exercise? @CAPS2 then, go onto youtube.com, type in exercise and work out. You will come up with millions of exercise routines you can do right infront of your computer, from yoga to high-intensity workouts. Another thing you can do it get online for how to stay healthy and exercise with tips from fitness experts! Lastly the experts is have been that we people are not having a sccial life and interacting with our family and pals. I would say we spend more time interacting with our buddies and close ones online then we do in public. With sites like facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and more we are talking to those people instantly through messages and comments! We are setting up our weekend plans online and a lot of our social life is there. Sometimes we have family that lives long distance, no one wants to pay for a call so we have the internet to connect via free video chat! In a nut shell, knowledge, exercise, and connecting with buddies are all positives in the computer. You can multi-tase so simply with just one electronic device and that is the computer! Experts, you do not need to worry about computers isolating us; they are bringing us together in new and exciting ways."
709	711	1	3	Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym to lift weights or use the treadmill. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too, building teamwork and discipline! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend and enjoying the outdoors. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every turn of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences, like shared meals and heartfelt conversations. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and choose real-world connections over a digital screen.
710	712	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computer have good or bad effects on people? It has been bought to @CAPS10 mind that people fight about @CAPS3 computers to @CAPS2 a doubt I think that computers have a positive on people. @CAPS10 think arguments are people find ability in talk online with other people and help with school work. First of all computers gieve in ability to learn about faraway places. This is really helpful @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 you want to learn about @CAPS4 you can go at the computer end google ""@CAPS4 @CAPS6"". By doing this you'll find a lot of info on @CAPS4, including pictures and maps. I should I tried it before for a school report. So that computers giving you this ability to learn about faraway places is really helpful to the human society. Second of all computers people to talk to other people around the world. This is really helpful @CAPS3 you want to learn about people from around the world and their daily lives. This is different than googling fatcs about other people. This is free because @CAPS3 you google @CAPS3 your online chat with someone you have a real conversation. In @CAPS10 thoughts thats the best way to is helpful for keeping in touch with friends and family @CAPS3 they dont live nearby. Third of all computer can help with school work. This is helpful students could learn about the world or about a different subject for class. This remind me of the time I had to @CAPS1 a project about the nine planets. I had to find a lot of info so that also means a lot of books and a lot of reading from the library. So these I the easiest and fastest way to @CAPS1 @CAPS10 project was using the computer. I went on the internet in @CAPS10 computer lab and get all the info that I needed from educational websites. So then I completed @CAPS10 project and headed it in to @CAPS10 teacher. She gave me a @PERCENT1 for a project grade. I got a @PERCENT1 because I misspelled @CAPS10 name, but that doesnt matter for the argument. What I am to tell you is that computers help students with school work like projects and research papers. @CAPS2 thinking I know that computer have a positive effect on people. @CAPS10 three arguments is that computers give you ability to learn about faraway places, allow you to talk online with other people, and help you with school work. Please take @CAPS10 side and think that computers have"
711	713	1	3	"Dear local news time editor, using a computer daily has a positive effect on people, wouldn't you agree? People should use a computer more often. I think everyone should have at least one or two computers in their house, they were invented for a reason. Computers allow you to interact with friends and family, help you with school work and, I guarantee that you will have a good time using a computer by playing games and meeting new people. If you have school work to finish, computers will help you get the work done. If you need to do some research, you can just go to a website like Google and what you needed to know will be right in front of your eyes in a matter of seconds. Computers can help you with many other tasks as well. There is an icon inside one of your documents that can assist you. I read an article on the internet about a study that stated that ""computer users are most likely to succeed in school."" Interacting with friends and family is always a positive experience. Maybe you do not understand an assignment from a certain class. You can add a friend online and they will tell you what has been assigned. Talking to family members can do good for you in many ways. You can be having some trouble in your social life, you can always talk to a family member or friend secretly through the computer. I remember having some difficulties with a few friends and one of my cousins gave me very good advice through an instant messaging program named ""AIM"". I guarantee you will have a good time using a computer. There are many games out there that you may enjoy. Playing these games will teach hand-eye coordination, says a noted researcher. You can meet new people who can also give you good advice. As you can see, computers have a lot of positive effects on people. You can interact with family and friends, receive a lot of help for school work and meet a lot of new people. Take my advice and buy a computer today."
712	714	1	3	How much of your free time daily do you spend on the computer? It is proven that people ten to fifteen years old spend an average of two to three hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend two to four hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this past decade, the percentage of exercise has gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of their time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports teams have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to spending time on the computer. The thought that runs through many people's minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk to them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every day. I check online for homework and for online shopping for about twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on television about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like various health shows and documentaries about the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least seventy percent of these people spend too much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating fast food then going home to play online games will definitely increase health issues like weight gain, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from staring at a monitor and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers now.
713	715	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I support the advances in technology. I am going to tell you a few things why. One is on a rainy day. I don’t think you are going to go out and play in the rain so you could go on the computer and play games or talk to friends. Or you could use the computer for school work or for your job. Say that you have to look something up for school and you can't get to the library, but you have a computer at your house. You can use it to find the information you need. You can use the computer to learn how to do something like making something new and a lot more. You can use the computer after school if you can't go out and hang with your friends in person. You can do something with them online instead. Last thing, you can ask your friends if there is homework so you don't miss it and fall behind. So that is why I support the many advances in technology that we have today.
714	716	1	3	Dear Editor, Everyone loves computers right? Those computers can help us with anything. They also give people facts about faraway places. And not only that but if you have someone that lives far away, you can chat with them online! What would this world be with no computers? First of all, I would like to talk about how computers can help us with anything. Computers can give us pictures of places, you can watch videos, and even see movies for free! Also you can check the weather, and if going to an airport you can check the flight time or if it has been canceled or not. There is just so many things that the computer can help us with! Now, it can also give you facts, opinions, pictures, videos, and movies about faraway places. Like one time I was going to Florida to visit but there was a terrible storm over there so the flight was canceled and I went on the computer and checked and it told me that it was canceled. Also if you are going somewhere faraway you can watch videos about that place. They also have maps to guide you through the way. And not only that but you can also check the highway for traffic so you wouldn't be stuck there. Wow, imagine living without a computer! Third of all, you can chat online with your friends or family! If you miss someone or you just want to talk there is websites that let you do that. Like Skype, Facebook, and Zoom! And you can also see the person if you attach a camera to you computer, it's called video-chatting. And you can do this anyone, anywhere, at any time! In conclusion, all of this can only be done with a computer. It helps you with anything, gives people facts about faraway places, and lets you talk online. There's many more benefits but for you to know that you'll need to go to the store and get yourself a computer to discover them all!
715	717	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, I understand that there has been some debate going on about computers. People think they're good. People think they're bad. Other people just don't care. People just don't understand the present day. Society is a whole lot different then when our parents were kids. People just don't get modern day society. I'm going to tell you the advantages and disadvantages to computers. There are a lot of advantages to computers. You can find information fast. Communication with people around the world is a huge advantage. Computers keep kids and teens entertained. There are games on many websites. Computers are the thing we use today for so many tasks. A lot of things are done by computers, and computers also prevent you from wasting money on books because you could just google the information you need. There are a lot of disadvantages to computers. They cost a lot of money to buy and maintain. Computers can break down and stop working. There could also be dumb websites that have no purpose like Facebook and Myspace which can waste your time. Computers are complicated if you don't grow up with them; it's hard to learn how to use them properly. The government has all their information in computers. If they didn't use computers, people would be able to steal information a lot less easily. Computers are the greatest thing we've invented so far. It helps with a lot of tasks these days. There are infinite numbers of information in the world and computers help find it quickly. I hope that this letter informed you more about computers. Good and bad things come from this technology. But, it is mostly good for our society. Kids and teens would be so bored without computers that they would likely drive their parents insane with nothing else to do.
716	718	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes glued to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have children and adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutely nothing productive! We are so fortunate; our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. And even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running programs held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please, exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children, writers, everyone, let's stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly happy but if we are on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contact. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusement park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our backyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on the computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instead of entertaining ourselves on the computer we could be taking hikes, walks on the beach even our street or playing outside in our yard. On a computer you can see majestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is so beautiful, why ever ignore it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a lot of their day on it. We could be improving obesity, spending more time with family and friends, and exploring Nature! Let's make a change so we can do all of these things and live a more fulfilling life.
717	719	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination. You can also learn about different people and places. But it also allows us to communicate with the people online. Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination. Because it's really important to have hand-eye coordination for many daily tasks. And when you're out in the world you really need to be able to look at something and pick it up or say if you get into an altercation with someone, you need quick reflexes. So it's really important to have good hand-eye coordination. Another reason why I feel computers have a positive effect on people is because you could learn about different stuff over the internet. Like learning about far away places and people from other cultures. So the internet is giving you a great opportunity to learn more about our earth, other than just your own back yard. So technically it's preparing you for life and the wider world. My final reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it allows people to talk to other people who are online. Like say you don't have a phone but you have a computer and you need to tell something very important to someone; you could do it online through email or a messaging service. And people say it's one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind for people who need to communicate quickly. Those were my three reasons why I believe the computer has a positive effect on people. And if you don't believe me go hop on a computer and see for yourself the benefits it can bring. You won't be disappointed.
718	720	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature, and having less interactions they are doing the world more bad than good. Almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside. First, exercise is a very important part of the day and it is happening less and less because kids are sitting in front of their computers all day long. There is so much talk these days about how we are the fattest country. Well here is one of the main causes: we have almost everyone staring blankly into a computer screen instead of being active. Computers are a big problem and they cause laziness to occur more often than not because now if you miss your favorite @CAPS1.V. show just look online you will find it. Or if you are doing a project just look online and you will find more than enough information and it is just a click away. Second, enjoying nature is a scarce thing now. All you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard. There are much less people outside. Because who needs to go outside when you could be chatting with a friend or just being on @ORGANIZATION1 looking up new technology. People who are always on the computer don'@CAPS1 care about the environment as much because they are wasting electricity and they are more focused on the internet in their place that they are on. There are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to @LOCATION1 when you can just look up pictures of @LOCATION1. It's taking away thrills people used to have of going places, getting out of the house, and seeing parts of the world far away first hand instead of through a computer. Third, there are far less interactions personally between well everyone. Kids that text, @CAPS2, or facebook chat more then talk in person with friends are losing talking skills of actually having a conversation. Because online you have time to think, then when you talk in person you have nothing to say because you can'@CAPS1 think and you're not to your full talking potential. People are seeing each other less and less now that they can text and talk over the computer; they think they now have no need to see each other and it is ok just to talk through the internet. Friends & family start to know who you are less because you can'@CAPS1 see emotion through a computer. Also, they say that you can learn more about someone in @NUM1 minutes of playing with them then in @NUM1 minutes of talking with them. With that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding. Lastly, computers are doing more harm than good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature as much and having less interactions people are just wasting their time in front of a computer screen getting fat rather then going outside with people and just passing a baseball. There are so many better ways people could spend their time than in front of a computer. Why don'@CAPS1 they see that and make a change for the better?
719	721	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, it has came to @CAPS2 attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad affect on those who use them. In @CAPS2 opinion they are not beneficial. First when on the computer people have less time to exercise. Also, computers don't always have appropriate sites. Finally, people have less time to interact with family and friends. I believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people. Without a doubt people who spend hours on the computer everyday have less time to exercise. @NUM1 in every @NUM2 young adults are obese. This is because most teens sit inside watching @CAPS1 or going on the internet instead of being active. Some students are so addicted to computers they never go outside! I understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but, kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future. As you know many web sites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accessible to them on the computer. Parents have to constantly worry what their child/children are doing just to make sure it is not bad. If less teens used computers as often as they do they would be lifting a load off their parents shoulders. I remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 on a website chatting with a ""@NUM3 year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @NUM4. If kids were not so addicted to the computer than they wouldn't get into these websites. Many teens spend their whole day on the computer leaving no time for their family and friends. For example when a friend calls and asks @CAPS2 brother to go skateboarding he says he is busy when he is just on facebook. @CAPS2 friend once said to me ""sorry I can't go to the pool today I am going to play rollercoaster tycoon."" With this attitude toward outdoor activities I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends. As you can see computers effect many people in a negative way. They prevent people from exercising, expose kids to inappropriate websites, and take away from valuable time with family and friends. I hope everyone agrees that computers aren't beneficial to people and that we should limit our use of them."
720	722	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a necessity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be soaked up by eager minds. Also, in today's world, waiting is almost non-existent. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better. Unless you want to risk tomorrow's future workforce, computers are an essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things about this world is that we're all different; connecting with each other helps us learn how to deal with each other and move forward as a society. Connecting through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for businesses as it helps them make decisions faster which will ultimately affect us. But don't be fooled. It can also be for pleasure, say @CAPS3's son is on a business trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and stealthily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is miraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be where we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research today, thanks to the fantastic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have chemotherapy. Let's face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a good thing, because faster processing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its processing speed, it certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases hold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analyze research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life expectancy, and who doesn't want to live longer? Some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your healthcare bill you're talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why do you still complain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement in life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's education, connect our world and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end.
721	723	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.
722	724	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people in the world use computers one time in their lives. Wether it's looking up information, sightseeing, or clothing with friends people are on the computer. They use their computers for work and games @CAPS1 children use the computer to learn. Some scientists suggest computers improve your hand-eye coordination, while others think it makes people smarter because they are seeing new things. You, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper staff, use a computer to type the news. You probally also use it for @CAPS3 of the things stated above. Most of the jobs in the world have one part that has to do with computers. Farmers @MONTH1 need to keep reports on their money income. Mechanics @MONTH1 use the computer to create blueprints, @CAPS2 officers use a computer to keep track of all the license plates. Baby sitters @MONTH1 need to do their homework. As you can see @CAPS3 jobs use the computer. How @CAPS3 people do you know that met someone or has a friend on the computer? I know I do, @CAPS3 people meet freinds on the computer. Ever heard of @ORGANIZATION2? they macth people together. There is @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS3 more sites were you can chat with freinds. All of these reasons come together and say the computer does benefit society. They help people in any number of ways. I agree we should spend more time outside but we should also spend some time inside.
723	725	1	3	I think that computers have great affects on people. Computers are a good way to @CAPS1 intouch with people, @CAPS2 online, @CAPS3 jobs, and @CAPS3 information on @CAPS4 facts. Computers might not be good exercise @CAPS5 you but at helps you in life and it also keeps you organised @CAPS5 example it keeps files @CAPS5 buisneses and @CAPS5 people that are in the music industry computers makes beats @CAPS5 them and can also record @CAPS5 them. computers helps every one in all ages. It helps the younger kids in school where they have to write a @ORGANIZATION1 or have to do a project, and helps the elderly peope @CAPS5 their jobs. Computers alson helps you know what is going on in life, like on the veiws see who has been hurt or the weather. Truely the computers are realty good @CAPS5 every thing they help you do so and it is really amazing how technologie changes. If it werent @CAPS5 come veters I dont think some of us would be where we are today.
724	726	1	3	Dear the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 studied that @PERCENT1 of people believe computers have a positive effec on people. You can stay in touch with realtives. Also you can entertain you over long trips. Computers have positive effects on people. Computers let you stay in otuch with realtives keep up with friens and are a good of entertainment. If you have distant realtives you can keep in touch. Video chatting lets you see someone and talk to them practically face to face from thousands of miles away. If you are sad and need to talk to somebody you are a few clicks away from being cheered up. Also if you are in the army and have a @ORGANIZATION1 baby you can watch as they take their first steps or say their. Video chatting used only way to stay in touch but also you just talk even wihtout a computer. Aim and @CAPS1 let you see whats goign on with your friends that you might see everyday or once a year at @DATE2 camp. @CAPS1 lets you keep in touch with everything thats going on with things like status updates. Aim lets youtalk with just your keyboard whre you type messages to poeple. Mabey you want to go in to town with a friends just send them a message by @CAPS1 or aim. Computers a onley for staying in touch though you can stay while you travel around. COmputers let you do so much to stay entertained over long rides or even rides. If you want to watch a movie just put in a dise or even rent on off itunes or netflicks. If you want to listen to a song download it in seconds and listen to your. Also you can even play video games on your computer. Just buy the game install it and then play. Computers are a great thing during down time and have positive effects on people. Computers let you keep in touch with family stay up to date with friends and are an excelent source of entertainment long trips or downtime. Computers are the lightbulb of the @DATE1.
725	727	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with. You can find plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. you can find dates on the computer, too and find information about certain eople too.
726	728	1	3	Dear local newspaper, did you know that the average person spends @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes a day on the computer? This is why I think that people are spending too much time on computers. If people spent less time on computers they would exercise more, be outdoors more, and spend more time with their family and friends. If people were to spend less time on computers than they would exercise more. With the growing problem of obesity in @ORGANIZATION2, less time on computers would help this. Tests show that the less time spent on computers the more time spent exercising. And with @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 obese, this would help that problem a lot. I once had a friend who would always be outside exercising and playing. Then he got a @CAPS1 account and he started to be home on the computer all day and would never be exercising. Less time on computers would also mean more time outdoors. Results from a survey I took at my school say that @PERCENT2 of people would go outside if they couldn't use their computer. And if more people are outside they will notice how nature is and @PERSON1 says that turning off computers reduces the use of electricity in a house. So if everyone were to turn off their computers they would spend more time with friends and family. There are programs like @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 for talking to friends and family, but it is not the same as talking face to face. You could also go outside and see people. Using @ORGANIZATION1 is an option but you would need to make an effort. It would be a lot easier and less complicated if you would get off the computer and talk to them face to face. This is why I think that people are spending too much time on their computer and it is having an effect on their life. If they were off the computer they would spend more time exercising, more time helping the environment, and more time socializing with their family and friends. So please @LOCATION1, stop using the computer all the time and consider the benefits of a more balanced life.
727	729	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they help with communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computers are entertaining. I hate to go look at nature, but I love to play video games on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball and then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing because after I am done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if it's raining, I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can communicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on Facebook. You can just log in and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat where you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywhere. Plus email is great for work; you can send information from one computer to the other. My last reason is for designs; every modern car that you drive is originally designed on a computer. People get on these computers and make blueprint designs to create cars. These are my reasons that computers are good and useful tools in our modern world.
728	730	1	3	Dear Newspaper, The invention of the computer has made a great impact on society today. Although many people would look upon computers on a negative note, the computer allows us to do essential tasks needed in everyday life. Many people feel that the applications on a computer are what keeps us away from doing other productive activities, but the applications a computer holds is necessary for most tasks. Apps such as the calculator save time from doing all the work on a piece of paper. It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than @NUM1 seconds. It's great for finding how much a tip is, for financial reasons such as how much you have to save, or even for doing some basic math or science homework. Another great application is note taking that can easily be typed. This application allows you to take notes by typing, which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or paper. Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz. The most important and most commonly used application on a computer device is the internet. The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons. If you plan to go to the movies tonight, the internet will surely give you movie times, directions, and how long the movie will be. It is also a great way to plan a family trip or to book flights and such. Considering this, the apps are very useful. The computer is also a great device to use for learning. It allows you to look online about new subjects such as far away places or people; where would our country be if we were not educated on the outside world around us? It is also a great learning technique for research. Our teachers today give us many projects and assignments to learn about new things, and what better way to research our topic than on the computer. The fashion of the @NUM2 and @DATE1 is just a project I did last month. The computer allowed me to find the garments both women and men wore, the material they were made from, and even how they managed to buy and get the material. The research from my computer gave me a great understanding on my topic and helped me to learn the basics. You would probably agree that communication can be used in negative ways, but communication is what keeps our world spinning. The computer device is one of the many devices used for communication. Email on a computer allows you to send messages to a single or multiple people without the need of a signal or service. Blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feelings or education on a certain topic. The instant message is probably the most used by teens. It is quick and allows you to quickly talk to a person without waiting for a reply for more than a few days. In conclusion, the computer is essential to our everyday life and without the computer, our society would not function as efficiently as it does now.
729	731	1	3	Dear Readers, I believe that Computers do good in our country and have a positive effect on people. This is because it saves paper by sending emails and you save money too, also you can learn new things about different countries like @LOCATION1, and lastly you can interact with people you know and talk to them and use technology to your advantage. These are a few reasons why computers have a positive effect on society and the way we live. First off computers help save the environment and they do this by letting us not cut down trees and make paper out of them. Do you know how many trees are cut down a day? Around @NUM1 trees are cut, and they are not all immediately taken to the mills to be turned into paper. But they stop in piles at logging sites and are left rotting there, not being put to good use. I feel that trees have feelings like us but can't talk without a mouth, so when you cut down a tree it's like robbing. Using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening. That is one reason why I think computers are a positive impact on life and society. Secondly, learning; you can learn a lot on a computer, all you have to do is look for it. I learn many things each day at school because of the help of computers and I feel that if computers are used it can excel our learning and we have been able to learn a lot more in a lot shorter time than we would have had to find a book on the subject we are looking for. Computers have made a big impact on children but we all learn new things when we use computers. So computers are a good thing and a bad thing. Finally, you can talk and interact with friends. Technology has advanced so much that we don't see the world in perspective; take a cell phone for example, what do you see? Most likely a phone. But if you open it up what do you find? You will find a micro computer that's capable of surfing the internet, playing music, just in a smaller size than before. Computers revolutionized the way we look at the world and technology; we can talk and play games using this technology. Most of what we see every day is used with technology, like a game station or even a car radio, and all of it is used to help us interact with one another. So I view technology as a good thing. In conclusion, technology has a positive and negative impact but has a more positive than negative influence. Technology helps us in our everyday lives and helps save the environment by letting us talk and save paper just by pressing a button. Technology has revolutionized the way mankind lives and how they view society but it is all a good thing in the end. And so I conclude that technology and computers have a positive and negative impact on society, with the benefits outweighing the drawbacks.
730	732	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer too much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most businesses need computers to keep the businesses up and running. Like where my mom works, she needs the computer for payroll, inventory, emailing the workers about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, trucks, etc. Business people have valid reasons to have to use computers all the time. Most business people also use computers to plan business trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and other educational sites. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time they can learn interesting things, like how cells divide into smaller cells, how body systems work, or how a girl or boy develops from embryo to birth. In addition, most people use computers for communication. Like @CAPS2, people use @CAPS2 to talk to others on the other side of the world or you can use AIM. I have a cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use AIM to talk to all my friends, and I use it to communicate face to face with them. So, don't say all people are on the computer too much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, although all people are often on the computer, it is most likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion, all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any negative effects on anyone because we all use it to our benefits and it has become an integral part of modern living.
731	733	1	3	Honestly, I totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the @LOCATION2, because of many reasons. And here are just a few of them. First of all, the internet can make people very obese, for example, if your friend was going to a walk to your house, but then decided to @CAPS1 you instead, he is probably not getting a lot of exercise. As a matter of fact, the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 is no longer cigarettes. It's obesity. Actually @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, with that number still rising. Another reason why internet use should be cut down is because of bullies, hackers, and terrorists. Because the internet provides a platform for these dangerous individuals to operate, children can be exposed to significant risks. And therefore, I believe that children in the @LOCATION2 should have their time online carefully managed and reduced for their own safety and health. It is clear that taking proactive steps now can help prevent serious issues in the future.
732	734	1	3	Dear newspaper, This year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online. This has made me believe that computors are not beneficial. Computors are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits. Plus, websites and some applications are dangerous. Also, they are very addictive. Computors have a bad effect on people. To begin, computors enforce bad habits. For example, some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people. Some kids @MONTH1 join in on the cyber bulling because other kids are kids @MONTH1 give in to peer pressure because they want to get accepted by their peers so badly. Furthermore, someone @MONTH1 agree to meet someone they don't know. That can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were. Recently, I read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they online. Most people found at that it was not the person they thought they were. Finally, the computor enforces bad habits because people @MONTH1 send someone some questionable pictures to someone else. As I mentioned before, when the police officer came to our school he talked about this. He said that people were sending pictures of them that were innapropiate to other people. Those other people would send it around and in the end it was a horrible mess. I'm sure if computers didn't have a giant effect on people, this would not be as big of a problem as it is. Computors do not only cause bad habits, but they are also dangerous. I'm sure if you listen to the news you will hear stories about child predators. I think that is one huge problem. If computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem. In addition, computors are dangerous because kids @MONTH1 choose to make bad decisions because they do not knew. For example, many kids who are on myspace or facebook have not talked to their parent or guardian about internet safety. Or maybe even their parent or guardian isn't monitering them to make sure they are safe online. In conclusion, the computer is dangerous because feelings could be hurt because of myspace, facebook, a blog, a video, or maybe even more. As an illustration, one time one the news I heard a story about a girl who was tensed on the internet. She felt so bad that she committed sucide. I found that horrible. A person should never comitt sucide, especially because some other person could not be nice. To sum up, computors are very dangerous. Computors are also addictive. To start off, it makes you spend less time with your family, leading to isolation and a lack of real-world interaction. This addiction can take over a child's life, preventing them from engaging in healthier activities and forming meaningful relationships offline.
733	735	1	3	As you can see, technology these days is always getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new invention that atracts many people to buy all the time. One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think to much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, @CAPS1 it's about same country, or how to solve a problem. @CAPS2, computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway. Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat. @CAPS1 it's population, density, languages, foods or holidays, computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help oprganize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people, is the feature of communicating with others, @CAPS1 it's taking to a faraway friend or family, or you're bestfriend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now, that they have webcams; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that @MONTH1 even live in another country, @CAPS2, most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straight foward directions. This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road. There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those for who are worried about the ones who should be exercising, being outside, enjoying nature, should learn to expand there time doing so, and shortening time online, and learn to be on the computer, only when necessary, thereby achieving a healthy and productive balance in their daily lives.
734	736	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I understand your one trying to decide whether or not computers are bad for people. I for one thing that computers are turning our society anti-social, we are becoming obese, and there is alot of cyber bullying that happens via computers. You can learn about all this and more if read on. @CAPS2 a stated earlier computers many problems in @LOCATION1's social lives. You see @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of our population spends at least @NUM1 hours a ween on the computer. When doing this they are typically . watching videos or tweeting a friends. This @MONTH1 all swim like a activity but it is really pulling us away from our social lives. There are many sites that allow you to chat with your friends and leave messages on their ""wall"" but is that really communicating? In a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on. You can't get a job by instant messaging a person, you have to talk face to face. But how will we be able to do that if we only email and @CAPS3? Plus while so much you will be prone to using in , thus you with, nothing but a bad grade. Now we to problem that we see occuring all over . You the work on the computer. This activity what , they monitor, lets you at , everyday, since he comes home and plays on the computer and more time exercising. Finally we come to my last issue, cyber bullying. Over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS4 teens will be faced with some sort of cyber bullying in their life. When teens sion up for facebook and twitter they are signing up for depression. When a teen starts to get bullied they usually become sad which then leads them grades to go lower due to lack of concentration and that leads them to be more depressed and that could make them either commit suicide or join gangs and/or start making bad . But we can prevent this if we the of time people out @NUM2 spend on computers. And I think benifit that. In conclusion I believe that is we are bad for society. I think them is we the amount of time could be lives. I think that if you look deep down into what it to say how you will understand why we need to do healthier @LOCATION1 by fostering real-world connections and physical activity."
735	737	1	3	Dear (Newspaper), This is a very controversial topic. I am discussing. But on this one, I must say I agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people. It ruins their social lives, and other bad things. If you spend all your time on the computer, you get no exercise, no fresh air, and you will not get to experience the rest of the world. Not recieving your daily exercise is a big problem. Obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the @LOCATION1 And it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day! you want to live a long and healthy life, don't spend all your time having your eyes give to a screen. In adition everyone needs fresh air, right? Going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all. You need your daily intake of oxygen. Lastly, if you are on long enough, enough, it will become an obsession. Computers already have a bad effect on people all around, and just think about what has just been mentioned. Another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends. As mentioned before, the social life you had will be gone. With that in mind, people will always see you on the computer, and eventually get sick of you. Computers bring no adventures, just pictures of them. Going out into the real world might be hard, but it is something that should be done. a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature. Haven't you always wanted to travel around the world, see different types of cultures, lifesyles, etc? It gets to the point where computer use should be limite, and living your life should be in place of your free time. Using a computer all day will not let you meet new people, and see new places. You will sbe getting nowhere with a computer screen in your face, so put it away! In conclusion, using computers all the time restrict you from exercising, getting fresh air, meeting new people, and seeing different places all over. At the end up the day, life is short, so you can't aford to waste it. computers have a negative effect on everbody, and hopefully someday these problems will be changed by a greater awareness and a conscious effort to live more fully offline.
736	738	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I feel very strongly about my opinion of what effects computers have on people, as in they help others communicate with one another, give people information about different types of things, and make people smarter. To me that sounds like something with a positive effect, would you not agree? First of all, as some people say it doesn't let you interact with family members. Yes, it truly does; you can interact with both friends and family members by going to chat rooms such as AIM or Meebo, or through web cam meetings such as Skype.com. So that throws that concern right out the window; you wouldn't have to worry about that. Secondly, you get to learn information about different types of things, such as learning about wild animals—any animal like a giraffe, cat, or rat—or learn about different places like Paris, Tokyo, and New York etc... Also, you could find all of this information at home in one single day. Most importantly, I would argue it makes people smarter; the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination for free. The computer can teach you about any career or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes, if needed. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people; they let people communicate with friends and family, you get to learn about different types of things, and they make people smarter. Even after I was done reading this, I thanked the lord for computers, as they help us so much in our daily lives.
737	739	1	3	"Dear Editor, I'm writing to you today about computers; I believe that computers can teach you things such as hand-eye coordination and how that can open job doors for you. Also, you can socialize as well as study with this remarkable device. My first reason being socialization. I think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options available. One prominent example would be Facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. In a recent poll, eight out of ten people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range they can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of a phone call. This can range from the United States to Hungary in mere seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good, they can be hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple educational sites. This means you can go from Wikipedia all the way to the infamous Google in just a click. Another reason I believe computers are good for studies is that you have endless resources at your fingertips; you will get the information you need without it being lost. My third and final reason is computers give you exceptional hand-eye coordination because I know an accountant. I asked him, ""John, did you take that accounting job?"", and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination."" And that's one job example; another would be real estate. Due to computers' multiple options you can look up properties for your client. With good hand-eye coordination, however, you can be more efficient with your work. This could help you lead the competition, thus making you more money. This then ends my essay, stating the benefits from socialization, moving down to studies, and ending right on jobs and career opportunities. These are only a few of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. Editor, I hope you read this with my warmest regards."
738	740	1	3	Dear School Board, I think that children are spending too much time on the computer for the wrong reasons. I say this because all young children and teenagers want to do is get on to social media and games all day instead of researching and educational things like that. I have three reasons why I think going on the computer for the wrong reasons instead of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends is a problem. The first reason is because it is very dangerous and there are sometimes kidnappers on the chat rooms. The second reason is because they are taking time away from trying to learn useful stuff off the internet. The final reason is because the internet influences violence. There are my three reasons, now on to hear more. The reason number one why I say people are spending too much time on the internet is because it is dangerous. Young teenagers and children all enter a chat room online. Most of the time that is bad because kidnappers lie about their information so that you can meet up with them and then they take you away. So instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking at the daily news or searching for educational content. This is why I say that the internet is not always good to be on all the time if you aren't learning about the nation. The second reason why I think spending too much time on the computer is a great concern is it's taking away from your schoolwork; children come in and go to the computer instead of doing their homework or reading. Kids like computers sometimes more than they like learning, and that's not good because not knowing the material could hurt them if they got up their determination, but they are on the computer for games but not for educational games. Another reason why I am concerned is that people are using the computer a lot for non-educational purposes. The final reason why I am concerned about people using the computer too much is because the internet on the computer can influence children to be violent in many ways; all the games and websites that show violence affect the world if they keep seeing such things frequently. I say this because in this generation when they see violence it gives them an image in their mind and then they think it's cool to do it because it seems exciting, like a game more than a book. When young teens see violence on the computer they think it's cool. This is the final reason why I was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer. So these are some of the main reasons why I say that the computer is not always a good thing because people spend too much time on them for the wrong activities.
739	741	1	3	Dear Editor, Technology such as the computer is proven to have a positive effect on people. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination, they give you the ability to learn about far away places, and allow you to communicate with others online. Technology is continuing to grow, and it is becoming to impact our lives more and more each day. One way that computers benefit society is that they teach you hand-eye coordination. For example, as a person becomes familiar with their computer they are soon able to type on the keyboard without even looking down to see what letter or number they are touching with their fingers. Although the person isn't developing hand-eye coordination in the same way as playing a sport such as baseball, they have still developed this valuable coordination. Computers also benefit our society because they give others the ability to learn about far away places. Instead of walking or driving to the library to find a book about Egypt; they can simply go online and type in Egypt under a search engine. Within seconds, thousands of sources appear right before your eyes, and you didn't even have to leave your chair! That is another reason why computers benefit our society. Lastly, computers and technology benefit our society because they allow you to communicate with others, reconnect with old friends or family, or simply share the latest drama from your art class. I know whenever I'm at my computer my instant messenger is always open. It is something I utilize every day in order to communicate with my friends and distant relatives. In conclusion, computers do benefit society, and they are proven to have a positive effect on people. Technology is like a sponge; it absorbs information and then continues to expand every time you add more. By doing this I am able to maintain healthy, strong relationships with others far and wide.
740	742	1	3	"Dear Editor, Computers are not bad for society. They actually can be quite good for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in them. Many people use a computer, a significant amount of the time, to talk with people on the internet, whether it is using video chat or e-mail. People who don't like to use computers and e-mail might say, ""Why not use a phone or even talk to them in person."" With e-mail, you can send a message to someone miles away. If you are sending someone a list, a recipe for example, you don't want to read it to them over the phone. It would be easier to type it out and then send it to them over the e-mail. ""When my son said he was going to teach me how to use e-mail, I thought it was going to be a waste of time,"" said Mrs. Johnson, a senior citizen. ""It turns out, it wasn't. Now I use e-mail every day."" Many people think email is a waste of time, but it can help you in your everyday life. The internet can helps in many ways also. It can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir fry but you don't know what to put in it, you try to call your mother but she isn't there. Your next choice is to look it up on the computer. It turns out there's a website that gives a recipe for a stir fry and you follow it and make the best one ever. I know from experience that you can find maps to places online, since I have to go somewhere new almost every week. Google Maps is one of the most used places on the internet, besides e-mail. Some newspapers have websites where you can read the paper without actually paying for it. This saves you money and it uses less paper so we can save trees. The huge world of the internet can change our lives. A large percentage of people that use the computer almost every day are students. Students use the computer for many reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e-mail. ""I have messy handwriting,"" said one student, Michael. ""So if it weren't for the computer, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me."" Michael is one of many people who are lucky that they have typing on the computer. Another reason students use computers is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that he/she used the internet a majority of the time. There may not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the internet will have many websites and blogs for him/her to use. The third reason is for help. There are many websites that can help a student with any subject. The internet can help a student pass school. A computer can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good for everyone in society."
741	743	1	3	"To use computers, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computers in their daily life today, but some believe that using computers does not benefit society. It is my firm belief that they do. Computers provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expanse of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on television? Well I have on many occasions. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games, from simple puzzles to complex adventures. This can also help improve your hand-eye coordination. You can also watch movies or television shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories, unleashing your creativity. Another reason why computers benefit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams, email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their friend. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency, get updates on events, and communicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are an enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, ""how make fire"" on google and thousands of matches would be found in seconds. Also, if you were assigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computer, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a restaurant that specializes in Italian cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices, get the restaurant's history, and find reviews for it all on one magnificent little device: your computer. So you see, computers benefit society greatly. In fact I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information. Now, to all of you people who still think computers are bad; I'd like to see you last a week without using one."
742	744	1	3	Dear City Council, I strongly believe that using computers has a benefit to the community. I believe this because using computers helps with research, jobs, and staying in touch with people. First and foremost, the use of computers will contribute to better research. Most students don't have textbooks about astronomy or geology at home with them so they rely on the internet. When my teacher gave the class a packet, I didn't know what some of the words meant. So I logged into my laptop and went on Google, within seconds the definitions were popping onto my screen like pop rocks. After I found out what the words meant, I finished my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet I don't know how long it would have taken, probably requiring a trip to the library. Equally important, using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs. A high percentage of today's jobs in our city require some kind of computer work. Some jobs require quick typers, and some people type as fast as a cheetah runs. Some jobs require people using spreadsheets or design software. Computers are a necessity to get a well-paying job in today's market. Lastly, using computers will open a gateway to communication. Social media platforms, email, and messaging apps are a few of the many ways to communicate online. If one of my friends doesn't have a phone, they most likely have a social media account. This gives me a way to talk to, share photos with and leave videos for my friends. One afternoon, my friends and I were all going to work on our science project. One friend's phone was taken away so the only way I could talk to her was online. Did you know that a large majority of our city has a social media account, email, or a messaging app? To conclude, I hope you enjoyed reading about how using computers helps with research, applying for a job, and communicating with family and friends. Please, City Council, publish this in the Newspaper so all residents will agree with me and recognize the value of computers in our community.
743	745	1	3	Dear state newspaper editors I have recently read an article that was talking about how experts are concerned that people are spending way too much time on their computers. Well I agree with them. I strongly believe that computers are taking time away from you exercising, enjoying nature and even interacting with family and friends. If you look at teens these days, more and more are becoming over weight. Back in the days when there wasn't computer or internet, not as much people were over weight or even obese because they had time to go out and exercise or play sports with others. Exercising is important because especially when as a teen you are over weight or even obese, these problems just don't go away. This will cost you in the future because not only do you have a chance of getting diabetes but you also have to pay for all the medications and treatments that comes with it. Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer will take time away from enjoying the things that nature has to offer. While others might argue that it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of places in the world online, I deliver this: why do you have to just read about the places online and look at the pictures? Why can't you be the one taking the pictures for others to see? And why can't you be the one experiencing it instead of just reading about it? Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is taking away time from you being able to interact with family members and friends. Well as a teen myself I have learned that interacting with family and friends is very important to our health. I am not the only person that agrees with that because study shows that kids that can talk to their parents and have good conversations with their parents have the ability to do well in school and have more respect toward others versus the kid or teen that can't really have conversation or talk to their parents. For example, if you are the type of person that talks to your family you will have good grades such as A's and B's and will learn to have respect for others, and the person that can't talk to their parents have trouble concentrating or even making trouble for themselves and getting D's and F's. Well I know that as a state newspaper editor you are a very busy person and have a lot of different things to do but I hope you take this in to consideration and remember the importance of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends for a healthier and more fulfilling life.
744	746	1	3	Dear Senator, I'm sending you this letter on the behalf of the people that spend way too much time on computers. Some people argue that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday. The truth is that a computer doesn't help you; in fact it hurts you. By spending all day on the computer you will get fat, lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life. As a whole our nation is known as an obese country. This is due to the fact that most people eat and then don't exercise. Most of these obese people don't exercise because they are glued to their computer. While interacting with others they just keep on eating, most don't even know why they're eating. If we want to erase our nation as being an obese country, then we must get people away from their computer screens. It is actually our fault, because we aren't making a stand. We must show people just how bad the computer really is. Also, while people are on the computer they're missing out on the world. They won't go outside, they won't know what the real world is actually like. Imagine that being an adult and having no clue about the outside world. Also, they could miss out on life changing experiences, the kind of experiences that people cherish, they would miss out on life as a whole. We only have one life, so you better enjoy it. It would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen. I truly feel bad for that person, then again it could be fixed. All that we have to do is take away the computer. If we do this then all the problems will be solved. Finally, if we get rid of computers we will be known as a new nation. Free from temptation and independent human beings. We will rewrite ourselves in history as the generation that made a change and got rid of computers for the betterment of our society.
745	747	1	3	Dear newspaper journalist, People shouldn't have computers. Computers have a negative effect on most people. Our country has the highest number of obese citizens in the world. A lot of people spend their day sitting in front of a computer at work. Then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride. Some people like to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet, even though there's a whole forest outside waiting to be explored. Another problem with computers is how safe they are. There are a lot of people on computers that don't belong there, and are trying to hack onto your computer. Viruses can sneak into your computer without you knowing it, and can look up everything on your computer, even personal information. They can even monitor what you're typing, which could be your passwords! A lot of people have been paying their taxes online and if there is a virus on their computer, they could get their personal information stolen! Plus, most people who pay their taxes online have to use their online bank accounts, so now the hackers have your bank account password too! Computers are bad for most people. They make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus, leading to financial ruin and a loss of privacy.
746	748	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I would like to tell you computers are very helpful in our society today. Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up big news and you needed to get it? Where did you turn to? I know not a book, but to the computer. Without it how were you going to get your info? I think computers are beneficial to our society because they can help you learn and they could tell you when or where to sign up for activities. People interact with others from different countries, states, and continents. Next, is how computers could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance, today my class and I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers, my class and I couldn't have gotten it done. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all and that would mean we would have to share. With sharing, some kids @MONTH1 might have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom between those two. With computers, we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computers can help set up activities. Computers could help you go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym to sign up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance, my little brother plays baseball and my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up and show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sign up, register, and pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents did, with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge and able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are beneficial to our new up and coming society!
747	749	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever forgot the book you needed for homework? Did you ever miss the newest episode of your favorite show? Well, all these things and more can be solved by using the computer. The computer gives us all the things we need. Whether that's information, games, or online friend chatting websites. The computer is necessary for our society today. Countless times I was in desperate need for information. If I'm doing a school report on animals, I can just go on the computer and search whatever I want. There's no more need for driving to the town library and then searching through countless books and encyclopedias. I just think that that is a waste of time, when you basically have everything you need twenty feet away. And it's in your house! There is no more need to search for hours through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find it in no time. To me, that's a life saver. Not only can computers help you with information, it can make school projects so much easier. In my own experiences, I've needed pictures on school projects. Instead of drawing it, the internet can save time and effort. All you need to do is print out the pictures! However, if you have an essay that's, let's say, supposed to be ten pages, who wants to write all that? With a computer, you can type it out in half the time. Then, when done, you can print it, or even send it straight to your teacher. But, if it's not finished, you can save it on a thumb drive, and use it on any computer you want. All in all, that's a huge help. My final reason why computers are good, is that they serve instant pleasure. Computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free. Also, it has many websites, like @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, that let you interact with friends. If you need to tell them something, there is no need for a phone. Plus, if you miss certain shows, or want to watch music videos, there are websites for that. As a kid, I'm usually never home because of sports and school activities. If I miss something on @LOCATION1, it is almost definitely going to be on the computer. You don't have to wait a week or so before they replay that episode. Who wants to do that? In the end, I think computers benefit people around the world. No more driving to libraries, or going out and buying games. The computer has everything you want for free. Basically, I think the computer is a huge time and effort saver that every household needs. It definitely benefits society.
748	750	1	3	Yes, I agree with the concern that experts have. I say this because it's true people get on the computer for a long time and forget about their family, there is also all kinds of danger online, and lastly your brain is not getting enough work out. Don't you think all of this is true? Well, then if you still don't believe me I'll prove it to you. First, people get addicted to the computer and they forget about their family. Instead of being on the computer just looking for stuff like Myspace or Facebook, they should spend time with their families playing games like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. I say this from a personal experience, it wasn't me it was my cousin @PERSON1; he got addicted to the computer so much that every time his family tried to do something fun together they would always end up fighting because he didn't want to go. Secondly, people can be facing major danger online, for example when you go to those chat sessions where you meet people supposedly your age, but it might not always be that way. Every time on the news you see stories where old people try to act like @NUM1 year olds, but they aren't; they just want to do bad stuff. So you can be facing a lot of dangers online. Lastly, by being on the computer you're not letting your brain get the good workout or exercise it needs. You're just letting it be there, but instead you can be reading a book or do a word search puzzle; these are all good ideas for making your brain exercise. On a recent research, experts say that people who spend time reading and exercising their brains do very good on tests, but people who spend most of the time on the computer fail tests. So don't you think I'm right? Don't you think that if you spend too much time on a computer you have less time with your family? You can be facing serious danger, and your brain is not getting the exercise it needs. Did I convince you yet?
749	751	1	3	I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society. There are three reasons why I do not agree. Many people will not enjoy the outdoors, @CAPS1 people will spend @CAPS1 their time on the computer, and a lot of people will gain weight due to inactivity. When you sit on a computer you don't get off for a while, why, because you are having fun. When you are having fun you will not stop what you are doing, @CAPS2 you don't pay attention. Eventually you will get hooked and play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends. @CAPS4 will just take up all of your time. @CAPS2 when you are bored you find anything that you can possibly do, rather than be bored. Many people are thinking this is a good time to go on the computer but @CAPS3 if you are bored you will stay on the computer until you have something to do. My mother always tells me when I'm bored not to stay home because @CAPS4 will get worse. There is always something you can do that doesn't involve it; you just have to look harder. My last reason is that when you sit at a computer and you are using your fingers, you gain weight. I read @NUM1 children every year will be obese, not because @CAPS4 runs in the family but because of inactivity. Inactivity means not active. @CAPS3 if you do not burn calories you will gain weight. @CAPS6 weight is unhealthy and you can stop the problem by just finding something else to do instead of spending your whole life on the computer. In conclusion, you @MONTH1 might have mixed thoughts @CAPS3 if you ever want to go on the computer all the time. @CAPS4 doesn't matter @CAPS3 if you go on, just don't do it all the time. But remember my reasons why not to spend too much time. You will not enjoy the outdoors, find something else to do when you are bored, and you will gain weight @CAPS3 if you spend all your time on the computer.
750	752	1	3	In my opinion I think that computers have nothing to do with people having lack of exercise or sleep. I think it is all the person's decision to be on the computer as long as they want. The person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not. When people are on the computer I think they don't play outside as much and start to get fat but that is their decision. Also when the time comes they are going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise. However, they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising. Being on the computer, @NUM1 people don't get the chance to interact with their family and friends because they want to be lazy and stay on the computer. The family and friends get angry and don't want to hang out anymore and within a couple of months they have no friends. Nature is good; it smells good, looks good, and computers make people stay inside all day! I think we should have more time outside. Also computers sometimes make kids want to not clean their room, not do chores because they are addicted to the computer. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with the individual to manage their own habits and time.
751	753	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I agree with the previous point that computers are not good because of different reasons such as putting a person's health in danger for not exercising much or making people spend more time on a computer than interacting with family & friends and sadly also it causes people to change their attitudes and ways of being. But if you want to hear more than you will just have to read on. There are plenty of consequences that people face for spending too much time on the computer, such as people getting addicted to watching certain things or simply getting addicted to the computer itself. Plenty of people nowadays have to wear glasses, and probably most of them have to wear them because of too much computer use, and it must be really bad having to wear glasses for the rest of your life. Also, too much computer is bad for a person's health because they're giving more time to a computer than spending that time exercising, which can lead to physical problems. I believe people should spend more time interacting with family & friends because excessive computer use can also make you lose your friends and/or family because you're not giving them the time they need, and friends and family are one of the most important things in a person's life. And last but not least, too much computer can change a person such as changing their manners, the way they speak, and their attitudes, making them less sociable. Well, I've given you reasons why I think computers are not good, such as putting health in danger, changing a person's life, and causing them to lose family & friends; now the rest is up to you to consider and act upon for a healthier lifestyle.
752	754	1	3	You need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how are you going to find out about your topic quickly and easily? Most people will turn to one of the most commonly used pieces of technology in the modern home, the computer. The computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting and communicating with friends, and for personal entertainment. Some people argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends, and exercising. But what if we didn't have the computer? The possibility of research and other tasks would be much more difficult. For example, computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily; this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful. Also, a computer can be accessed right in your home, so no travel is required, saving both time and effort. The computer has programs that are used to prepare articles, essays, slide shows, and brochures for presentation, as well, which are essential for school and professional work. If we didn't have a computer, research would be much more of a struggle and could require travel to libraries or other places. Computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family. Websites and e-mail help you keep in touch with anyone around the world. You can write e-mails, access live chat, or even use a webcam. E-mailing is just like mailing a letter except it is delivered instantly and doesn't cost anything, making it highly efficient. There is also no risk of anyone reading your mail if you use secure services. Live chat is when you chat over text on the computer, allowing for real-time conversation. Webcam is face-to-face interacting which gives off the effect of talking in person; a key benefit is that communication over the computer doesn't cost a thing, which is great for long-distance relationships. Lastly, computers provide games for your personal entertainment, which helps kill boredom and offers relaxation. The computer also helps improve hand-eye coordination through interactive activities, along with staying organized; documents, pictures, videos, and more can be placed in files and saved on the computer, making it easy for you to open them at any time. Computers may take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things would be without them. I think that the computer has a good effect on people as well as it being a helpful piece of technology that enhances our daily lives in numerous ways.
753	755	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a great and beneficial effect on society. They have numerous many features, options, and abilities to use! Would you really try to prevent your child, friends, and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day? The computer can help others communicate, help educate you, and even prepare you for the future. One great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others. You can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family. Now some people might think, why not use a phone to talk to others, but there are many reasons why talking online can be better than using a phone. I remember one time a few years ago, me and my cousin were alone at her house when the phone wasn't working. She went downstairs to get us some sodas when I heard a crashing sound; she had fallen down the stairs. Because the phones weren't operating, I hopped to the computers in her room to quickly ""chat"" with my dad and tell him what happened. From there on, my dad called an ambulance and she was all right. Clearly, not only are computers a great way to communicate, but they can also save someone's life in emergencies! Another feature computers have is that they can actually educate. For example, if a student has to write a paper for school about a specific topic, then they would need to do some research. The internet explorer on your computer can open your eyes to a world of knowledge. All you have to do is go to a search engine such as Google or Yahoo and type in the subject you wish to learn more about. Before you know it, there are millions upon millions of websites that can educate you on the subject you want to gain more knowledge on. A high school teacher states that a large percentage of students in the school use the computer to help them with homework and research. Indeed, there you have it, the computer's a great resource for information and learning. One last reason computers are highly beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs. Perhaps some day your child will get a job working in an office where they must use computers all day long. The head of the company is not going to hire you if you are not experienced with computers. However, if you know how to use a computer effectively, then you have a great chance of getting a job that can support you and your family. Studies say now that a significant portion of businesses involve using a computer. Computers are becoming a bigger part of society by the second; it's important to start learning more about them as soon as possible! I think now it's very clear how important computers are in our society. They help increase communication, are a great source for knowledge, and help prepare you for jobs. With each passing day, computers help advance the future and help make the world a better place for everyone."
754	756	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to let you know that many people are spending too much time on computers rather than enjoying nature. People say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying they are too absorbed. Many people should remember to think about nature and what nice things it has in store for us. I'm going to say that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I'm thinking that in some points many family members and friends see the other relative person on the computer so much it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing that should not be neglected. A majority of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can affect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision). Certainly, more and more people should lay off it and take breaks. A researcher from Yale University has conducted extensive research and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damaging if used all the time. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on computer use to let people later on have the spare time to enjoy and have fun with nature or do something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time affecting themselves negatively with too much screen time. Whatsoever, I'm hoping for you to agree with my position so this can be possible to break this habit of going on computers and having no time for your family and friends is not such a good way to start off with life, and we should strive for a better balance.
755	757	1	3	"Dear Editor, Health experts are concerned about today's population's computer usage. With this I agree, as many children and adults are counted and labeled as obese, or overweight. Technology has advanced enough to have machines do everyday tasks, proving how lazy some individuals are now-a-days. People sit at home staring at a computer screen, forgetting about spending time exercising, enjoying nature, or being out and having fun with friends and family. Having a computer clearly interferes with one's social life in real situations, not the ""virtual life"" of chatting with others over the internet. Having applications released that connect people over the computer devastates the reason to leave your house and engage in physical social activities. Now with video chat, you virtually meet the other person, showing how lonely and individually separate you can become from others. While your friends are having a party, you'll be absent, as I'm sure they won't have a webcam there for you to join remotely. Another reason why a computer is not needed is many people neglect pure nature. When surrounded by the new digital age, the beauty of the outdoors becomes forgotten. Sure you can watch videos and look at pictures of nature, but is that really anything compared to the crisp, clean air against your hair or the once in a lifetime animal actions you might see? Plus, nature and the fact of being outside might inspire you to continue a diet, or begin one, seeing how healthy and perfect the outdoors can be. It also serves as a great place to exercise and improve your physical well-being. As we all know, obesity is a factor in the country and around the world. But now, being overweight is at an all-time high, claiming lives and causing many into depression. In my opinion, I believe this is highly related to computer usage, especially with fast food playing a role. People have not realized the need to exercise more often and break sedentary habits. In conclusion, you can see how computer usage has affected us as a nation, and in a negative way. Computer using might be ""ok"" when used in moderation, like sweets or oily foods. It does serve as a way to pass time, for a while, but so does exercise, which is far healthier. Which one would you think would end as a better solution? Obviously, we must stop relying on technology to help, and begin activities ourselves again to foster a healthier and more connected life."
756	758	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that people are spending too much time on computers. I believe this and I have @CAPS7 reasons why. @CAPS2 first reason is that people waste money on it. Also, everything they get from the computer you can get from a book. And finally, @CAPS2 reason is because of the ""@CAPS8 crisis."" @CAPS2 first reason for saying that people spend too much time on the computer is that people waste too much money on it. I believe this because of your electric bill and your @CAPS3 bill. The people who have a computer find their electric bill is always very high, and for that reason, they are forced to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity. This is also true because of the constant charging of laptops or the continuous running of desktop computers. Also, they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to keep the @CAPS3 connection active. So that becomes a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going down the drain. @CAPS2 second reason for this is that anything and everything you can get on the @CAPS3 you can get from books. I believe this because where do you think the website makers get their information from? They get it from books. Reading books also increases your knowledge so that at any time you can quickly come up with an answer without needing a device. Another reason is that some websites are not always accurate with their information, whereas books are typically more thoroughly researched and verified. @CAPS2 third and final reason for this is that we are all dealing with this ""@CAPS8 crisis."" @CAPS7 people every day are getting less and less active because of computers. This causes fewer people to be physically active and consequently less fit. And the @LOCATION1 is suffering because of it. Less and less people are joining the army because of this crisis, and computers are sadly contributing to this worldwide problem. I eagerly hope that @CAPS2 letter has helped you see @CAPS2 point of view on this subject, to show that people spend too much time on their computer because it's a waste of money, anything you can get from a computer you can get from a book, and because of the ""@CAPS8 crisis."""
757	759	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have heard the concern of many scientists about computers. Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society, but they are harming our children's health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities, and they are having health problems. Because of an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending quality time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated significantly less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave, which disrupts family routines. This obsession with the technology is making it harder for families to grow emotionally and for children to be more successful in school. The computers are distracting children from a better education. Athletic activities are also suffering because of @PERSON1; children prefer fresh air less. They will be on websites all day instead of being on a sports team because of computers. Furthermore, there are serious health concerns. The electricity that runs computers produces a low level of radiation. Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death over the long term. When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she complained about massive headaches that kept returning. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for many hours, they have an increase in appetite. These children eat because they have nothing better to do. While on the computer, the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise. They could become obese and possibly get diabetes. Therefore, there is less communication in families, a loss of exercise, and serious health concerns caused by the computers. The consequences of misusing this technology are devastating and could be life-threatening. Thus, I urge you to do whatever is possible to use the computer less or face the serious consequences that come with it.
758	760	1	3	Computers are great; they can help you with anything you need. You can shop on them, pay bills, even book a flight to go on vacation, but people are spending too much time on them. They should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day. Many people are spending more than enough time on the computer. People can often stay on the computer for hours and not even realize it; they stay up all @TIME1 doing work or playing games. After @TIME1 a while, it will eventually take a toll on the body. Because @CAPS2 you are on the machine all day, then you are using little to no energy at all. So then you spend @CAPS1 nights in bed tossing and turning, unable to sleep properly. Then that leads to feeling horrible in the @TIME2, and if @CAPS2 you do it @TIME1 it is going to have a bad effect on your body. I believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight. If @CAPS2 you are sitting in a chair all day, then you get no exercise whatsoever. Then when you eat, you don't burn off the calories, so that leads to people gaining weight and becoming overweight; from that, your body becomes very unhealthy and will most likely lead to health issues. When people are on the computer, they end up ignoring nature. They miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or going out and playing in the snow and making @CAPS5, forts, or having a @CAPS6 fight. They even miss out on just going outside and taking a walk; the reason is because they are @CAPS7 @CAPS8 inside their house with their stare glued to the computer screen. Being on the computer takes a lot out of the body. It can cause health problems and even problems in general with social interaction. So people should just spend a part of their day on the computer. The other part of the day they should be outside, walking around, maybe playing with pets, children, or friends. As long as they're out of their chair and not on the computer, they will be getting some exercise and fresh air, which is vital for a healthy life.
759	761	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a useful tool when doing a school report or something to that effect, but, @CAPS2 we really need those computers? When using a computer for a school project, @CAPS3 can be a hassle. One of many problems people are faced with while using a computer is freezing; when doing a project and your computer freezes, @CAPS3 can be very time-consuming as you wait for it to restart. Another problem is pop-ups; pop-ups can cause viruses, and when your computer gets a virus, @CAPS3 leads to it becoming very slow, which wastes even more time. Which leads us to our next problem, slowness; when a computer becomes slow, @CAPS3 is very a digital frustration. There are several problems and risks that come with a computer. One health problem is that you can become a hermit and stay inside all day because you're too attached to the computer. Another problem is that you can become very obese because you're not getting any physical exercise. One risk of using a computer is that you could end up getting a Facebook, @CAPS1, or Myspace, and meeting someone who is pretending to be someone they're not and get abducted by a molester! There are other alternatives you could make instead of using a computer. One alternative is that you could go to the local library and check out books on your topic that you're wanting information on. Another alternative is to ask a teacher if she/he could lend you a class textbook. But the main alternative is to choose old-fashioned books over a computer! So now @CAPS3's your choice, ""@CAPS2 we really need computers or can we live without them?"" @CAPS3's your choice to make for a healthier and safer lifestyle."
760	762	1	3	Computers. They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits mankind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the other hand, computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy-to-use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all-purpose dictionary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia, and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone for quick access. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like Facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrastination is very easy to give into. But self-control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formatted onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound textbook, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier on your back. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you need is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way with searchable text. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, exercising, and seeing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society through screens. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated online. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landscape instead of the real world. Self-control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when and how long to use them. They have several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information access. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this, I hope that society can think carefully about the pros and cons of the computer before spending endless hours in front of it.
761	763	1	3	To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on today's society. People depend on them a lot but some people disagree. I think that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very entertaining. They can help find long lost friends and keep in contact with them. Plus they can be helpful with homework. Please proceed on reading to see as why I chose these reasons. Firstly, computers can entertain. There are thousands of games to chose from, ranging from dress up to educational. Which are good for young children of age five through six. As it states in the writing prompt it teaches hand-eye coordination, which is a valuable skill for early development. In addition to my first reason, computers help long lost friends. There are websites that help you find people. For example, Facebook, Myspace, and yahoo. These websites help keep in touch too, with family members who live far away. If theres no phone then theres always the computer to send a quick message or an email. Lastly, computers can be helpful with homework. Sometimes you don't even need internet theres a calculator built right in for math problems! But a nationwide website thats used and children improve from it is edhelper.com. This website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on, providing practice in various subjects. In conclusion, I think that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, keeps in contact, and helpful with homework. Please take my reasons into consideration.
762	764	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active and your body will suffer. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed miss out on activities such as sports. For example twenty percent of americans play soccer. In the beautiful fall when the leaves are beautifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beauty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you might miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (couch potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You might think you just playing farm town or chatting on facebook, but in future you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect this with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that fifteen percent of children are obeased because of computer games. You might be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, John and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out the computer. Now he way over two hundred pounds and he is only fourteen. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on Facebook can cause you to procrastinate. For example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there for college I garentee your going to put off school work, chores and other responsibilities that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time for bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level fifty or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet convinced a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day for one week can damage your vision from a normal level to a worse one. If you keep it up now it might not seem bad but many hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad for your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer.
763	765	1	3	Dear editor, I beleve that people should have computers, The resons are it dosen't take five days to email. You can learn about faraway places. Also you can talk to people around the world. After looking at these detail most people are likly to agree. Firstly it dosent take five days to email you can email someone and it takes five seconds to get to the other person. While regular mail takes five day to a week to get to another person, which is much slower. When you email some one and then the email you back it saves the time and government money on postage. Email is much fasters than the mall or I like to call it snail mail, making communication efficient. Another reson is that you would be able to learn about diffrent contrys faraway and near. Would you be able to learn about Japan from you living rooms without computers. No you wouldnt't. Without computers would you be able to learn about the earth quake in chile as it happens. No you wouldent. Compters are modern day telivision for kids, providing endless information. Lastly you can talk to people on the computer there is many ways to talk to people like facebook, myspace, aim, and vidio chat you don't have to call some one on the phone when you can jus vidio chat with them and see their face. In conusion computers are good. You can email fast and save time. You can learn about foreinge contrys in you living room without traveling. You can also chat with people online from anywhere. I think computers are good what about you.
764	766	1	3	Dear Editor, Have you ever used a computer to do anything besides buisness? Well if not then when you are not busy you should try it. The effects computers have on people is that it's a lot of fun to go on and play, helpful with mostly anything, and you can find just about anything from websites on clothing to maps to the store location. There are three reasons why you should agree with me and these reasons are people have the right to choose what they want to, in this weather it's a little bit to cold to go out and enjoy nature, lastly they can interact with friends and familys online on a website. People have the right to choose what they do because the goverment can't choose for you since they're busy with other more important stuff like running the country. Also in the constitution it states that the goverment can't choose for us while we have the power to think for ourselves. In this weather it's cold to go out, plus nature is so much better in the spring and the fall where it's not to hot to cold and thats when the sun is good thats when people should enjoy nature. With all the technology in todays world it's better to take advantage of the technology in this world, also the technology we have is helping people like generators because in old times people didn't have generators for power during storms. So I hope this letter has changed your opinion about using computers for leisure and thank you for reading it.
765	767	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, My opion in this is that, computer are used all the time. People use them to talk to friends and family online. People also use computers for home work online. And the last rason I say computer are used is just for fun stuff game you can play. I use the computer to look how my teams are doing. Now on to more about why. Computers are good for society, because people use computers to talk to friends and family on Facebook, Skype and Twitter. This is a good reson becuase we all have family that we want to stay connected with. So I think that this is a good way to talk to them. An for friends this is a good way because if they move you can talk to them on this and not lose touch. The reson it a bad thing is because people like older men can use the computer for child pornarapy and talk to younger girls about sex and thats not right, which is a serious danger. Now on to more about using computer for homework. The reson computers are good to us is because people can use there computers for homework and research. This is good because if you need to do something on our history then that what thats good for this is good because everything you need is on a computer, like articles and encyclopedias. Now on to more about how computer are good to society. My last reson is because computer are good for fun stuff. Computer can have every game you want they have kid games, my eight year old sister goes on to the games that you can match colors and shapes. Teenagers can play games on the computer with their friends online. The compter for me is cool because I can see how my football team is doing in the standings. How my baseball teams are doing during the season. This is why the computer are good. These are my opion on this is that compter are used all the time peopl use them to talk to frend and family online. Peope also use computer for homework to get better grades. Finally last and final reson is because you can use it for fun games for kids of all ages. An I can check how my favorite teams are doing anytime I want.
766	768	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I strongly suggest that people should spend more time away from the computer. Instead they should be doing more exercise, engaging in more outdoor activities, and most importantly spending more time with family and friends. I think the best way to get everyone to agree with me is to write a passage to explain why I think that people should spend more time away from the computer. The most important reason why people should stop wasting time on the computer is so that they could get more exercise. Getting more exercise could help you out in a big way because the less exercise you get means the less healthy you are. More exercise could also be helpful because you could have health preventing you from getting diabetes, and a lot of people get diabetes from not being in shape. My last reason why I say that getting more exercise is good for you is because, if you get more exercise then you would not have to worry about all of the diseases and problems when you are in your elder ages. Another way you could spend your time instead of staying on the computer is by doing outdoor activities. Outdoor activities could be really good for you because if you are not used to going outside and playing a nice game of football with your friends then it would be very fun for you. I remember one time when I first started going outside I had so much fun playing games with everyone. My last reason why I say that more people should spend time doing more outdoor activities is because of nature. It would be really good for you to go on a walk in a nice @DATE1 day to feel the breeze and smell all the nice scents from the flowers and trees. My last reason why I say that you should spend more time off of the computer is so that you could spend more time with your family. Spending time with family is way more important then going on the computer with friends. I remember one time when my cousin and I were at his house and we really did not know each other but I got to spend more time with him and now we know a lot about each other. My last reason why I say that you should spend more time with your family is because you could learn a lot about your family history and stories. So now you know the three reasons why I say you could be doing more things instead of spending time on the computer which are exercising, doing outside activities, and spending time with your family.
767	769	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do have positive benefits on society. These advancements in technology can only enrich people's lives. One way computers help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers' pages for assignments and resources. Another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or thing they can count on the internet to help them out. Most importantly they are a vital source of communication. People depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know. Without computers students would have it a lot worse. When a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teacher's online page and check what the assignment was for that night. Another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks. If a student can't manage to carry home @NUM1 pounds of books they can just use their textbook online. Nowadays, the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational sites. Teachers also can allow students to research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computers help out educationally, they are probably the most well known information centers. If people want to see about a restaurant, store or product, they can do that online. Also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. An extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. Before someone decides to buy something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. People can even order groceries to their new house if they are busy! I strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. For example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me times and locations of the next game or practice. I would be lost and confused without these emails that I depend on. Businesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in business. The use of web conferences saves a lot of travel and it allows the company to be in business with people all over the world. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep in touch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. Without the internet, probably half of the world's communications would be down and that would not be good. Computers, without a doubt, have a positive effect on society. When it can be an educational resource it is very helpful. Also, it is the best information database known and is probably the most used. Most importantly, without computers the world would be a mess without their main source of communication. People know not to spend too much time inside and they always know when to go outside have some fun and get some fresh air. Therefore, computers have no negative effect on people and they remain an essential asset in everyday life.
768	770	1	3	Dear Readers, I understand some people are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and that it is bad. I disagree, computers can help keep family members that live far away in touch. You can also see pictures of things that you can't see everyday. Finally, it helps your school work. I know a family that has a son fighting in the @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop with him so he was able to video chat with his family. It seemed as though he never left. Without it, his family would wonder how he was and be worried constantly. You don't have to have a family member at war to talk to them on the computer. Have you ever wanted to see what @LOCATION2 looks like? You don't have to travel there to find out. All you have to do is search it on your computer! If you live in a city with not a lot of nature in it, you can see what it's like outside it with the computer. Seeing those sights in @MONTH1 might make you want to travel, and travelling with your family brings you closer together. A study shows @PERCENT1 of families that go on vacations have strong relationships. Having a computer is mandatory for school. It is the best thing to research with. @PERCENT2 of students that are failing don't use a computer for homework. There are also websites that you can use for studying and practice tests. There is a student in my school that failed most of his classes. He never used a computer. His friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble, which he tries. He used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day. He ended up getting a @PERCENT1 on the test because he used a computer for his studies. It doesn't matter if you are using a computer for homework, talking with friends and family, or for exploring the world; it is one of the most important inventions ever made and it greatly benefits our lives.
769	771	1	3	Computers are very important, I don’t know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenagers. Most of the sites we use are for interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is Myspace and Facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a Facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but computers have webcams so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers that's why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do without a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family members there are mostly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me to google it. This is one of the main things people do when they use a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a computer is a waste of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice don't spend all day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy yourself in any way possible like playing a sport or visiting a park.
770	772	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers hold exclusive information, I do not believe they have a good effect on people. The majority of students today crowd around a computer while they can be taking care of their body. Such as exercising or just going outside. People need to enjoy the wonders of nature instead of sitting on a computer. Not only will computers impact people, but it @MONTH1 also impact family and friends. There will be less interacting time and a risk taken by going on a computer. Different websites can expose the wrong thing and get you into trouble. I firmly believe that computers have harmful effects on people. In @LOCATION1 today, we are already loaded with obese people. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are not physically healthy and a majority of obese people today state that they do own a computer. Computers attract people and some @MONTH1 sit at the computer for hours at a time what about exercising or enjoying the outdoors? Computers damage our bodies in a way by luring ourselves in while we can go out and enjoy nature. I definitely will argue this fact that computers have a bad effect on humans. Computers change not only the body, but the mind. My sister has a computer in her bedroom and I barely see her at all. She stays up there all the time, and when my mom calls for dinner, it takes more than five @CAPS2 to get her away from her computer. Computers affect people because they keep humans away from civilization. Friends and family are impacted by the lack of interaction from one person. It's disrespectful to take time away from your friends to play on computers. This ruins many people's social health, because the more they ignore their family or friends, these people will stop trying to interact with them. When these computer fanatics come around, there won't be anyone there for them. Computers definitely have an unhealthy effect on people who use them. How would you feel if tons of your personal info got out into the public. Nowadays, computers have a major chance to do that to you. Websites like @CAPS4, Myspace, or Twitter have your information, and with a click of a button, it can be exposed to the world. Computers have a background of doing this kind of effect on people. Some don't understand what they are doing and if bad info or a picture sends out, it can fully negatively impact your career or education. Computers help people to make wrong choices and there is no doubt people should let up on the time they spend on the internet. Many agree, computers disadvantage many people in their own way. Whether it is by taking their health away because it keeps many indoors, or if it costs you your friends and family, computers are not good for your physical and social health. Computers can send out information and they are risky. They will majority impact your future and impact all people in a bad way by isolating them and creating health problems.
771	773	1	3	The effects of computers on people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention than they need to. The first reason why is that most spend their time on social networking, constantly checking for updates and notifications. The others are either buying things online or playing immersive games for hours. Some of the people that are on the computers are wasting too much time being tech-savvy, focusing on digital skills that have little real-world application. It's other ways people can spend their time like biking in the park or taking a brisk walk around the neighborhood. Another solution is you can get up on your learning skills by reading books or find a job around your town that involves physical activity. Computers drain and waste people's minds everyday with endless streams of information. I think it is essential for the people that can't get off to seek fitness and mental health through outdoor pursuits. Then again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want, such as for work or important research. The people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do that is more productive. I think it'll be a good idea to have a time when the computers should be shut off one day or a week. By that I mean the cable/internet company should turn the internet and the cable off for a week of pure exercise and outdoor activity. That'll make people who are lazy to do something active like playing sports or gardening. It'll also be a good motivator for people who are on the computer or watching t.v. too much to rediscover other hobbies. Then it would make everybody fit and healthy if they try and participate fully. I understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help and medical information. That's understandable but everyone else should not be exempt from this digital detox. Computers and laptops should be network disconnected periodically to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building like learning a musical instrument. Everyday people are being digitally sucked into their screens. Some people in this world just can't get enough of it and it needs to dead soon before it causes more harm. The government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you, like community service or physical labor. It should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house to check compliance. Another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go home-to-home to make sure the procedure is being done correctly. A lot of people are not going to like it and they will not obey the new law, preferring their digital comforts. It should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it, such as a fine or community service. The second choice should be a loss of internet services for a set period. That'll make them really mad and in exchange they should still exercise as required. Sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change their deeply ingrained habits for the better.
772	774	1	3	Did you know that computers are the number one selling electronic device in the world? I think that computers are only making our society a smarter and more intelligent place by providing instant access to vast amounts of information. Also computers help old time friends and family keep in touch across great distances through various communication platforms. Finally I think they are helping our society because computers teach great hand-eye coordination through interactive tasks and games. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of the people growing up with computers at home have a high paying job due to their advanced technical skills! Computers are very intelligent pieces of equipment and if you know how to use a computer you will most likely have a high paying career in many modern fields. Also mostly every job from doctor to police officer to cashier at a store all involve computers and to do those jobs you must know how to work a computer effectively. This is only one of the many reasons I think computers will benefit our society in the long term. Secondly, I think that this piece of technology benefits society because it keeps family, friends and workers in touch no matter where they are located. Have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living far away? Well, computers are one of the most popular ways to do so with all the new websites like Facebook, Twitter or even your old email website people are keeping in touch all over the world easily. Another way computers help old time friends keep touch is with the new video camera in the computer; family, friends and workers can actually see each other from different parts of the world in real time. A simple message though one of these websites will make someone's day and could even make yours when they reply. Finally I think that computers benefit our society because they teach hand eye coordination and other life skills through practical use. How do you think people can shoot a gun so accurately and so quickly or how do you think a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time? All these things revolve around hand-eye coordination which is best learned by using computers and similar devices. Also people can save lives by just a type about a hurricane, tornado or any natural disaster; but if they do not know how to work a computer many people can get injured or die from lack of warning. These are only three of the many reasons I think computers benefit our society greatly. So think twice about the negative comments people say about computers and consider their positive impacts.
773	775	1	3	Dear school board, teens that use computers is a good thing for their development and social life. I state this because the web has many things to do that are both entertaining and educational. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace are all social sites that allow for interaction. Also there are video sites such as YouTube that provide a wealth of content. Plus teens learn how to type fast, which is an essential skill in today's world. Social network sites are good for teens to express themselves and connect with peers. Teens get to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want on their profiles. For example, on Twitter you can post tweets, on Facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and on Myspace you can send messages to communicate. Teens relieve a lot of stress on the web by engaging in activities they enjoy. Videos are great when you're bored and need entertainment or information. Type in YouTube and get a good laugh or two from comedy clips. Teens that go on YouTube become more social by sharing videos and discussing them with friends. For example, teens can learn the new dance moves from tutorial videos. Plus on video sites there are comedy sketches that provide humor. Comedy helps daily life by reducing stress and improving mood. Typing helps life if you work in an office or a trade market where computer skills are required. Teens learn to type to make life easier and more efficient in their schoolwork and future jobs. For example typing fast is like texting on a phone but more professional. Typing is like writing a letter electronically, which is the modern standard. So get to typing and improve your skills. Ok so computers do help life in teen years by providing various tools and platforms. Basically it is essential somewhat for modern living and communication. All people should have a computer to access these benefits and opportunities. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and typing make life better and more connected for everyone.
774	776	1	3	Yes, I do think that we should continue using computers because it helps us stay in contact with other countries around the world, it forms a balance between digital and physical activities, and it also makes life simpler in many ways. First of all, computers help us stay in contact with the other countries around the world through instant communication. Without computers we would not be able to email or even video message other countries about important events and personal matters. Second, we have to balance computer use and exercising and interacting with others; but computers can help us interact with family and friends by emailing or video chatting can also help you stay in contact when face-to-face isn't possible. Last, using computers makes life simpler like how it's so much easier to write an email and not a letter by hand, and its easier to instant message someone then to call them when you need a quick response; also for school projects you can make your project look so much better by adding pictures and different fonts instead of just hand writing it plainly. That's why computers aren't a waste of time because they help us stay in contact with the other countries, they form a balance between our online and offline lives, and it also makes life simpler and more efficient for everyone.
775	777	1	3	Dear world, computers are a necessity to life in the modern age. They benefit not only the community but the whole world by connecting people and information! They provide education for anyone who has access to the internet, from children to adults. Secondly, it's a form of communication that spans the globe. Also, computers can be fun and entertaining, offering a break from daily routines. As you know, education is one of the most important things in anyone's life, and computers play a key role. Where would we be without a computer to help with research and learning? Think about how many times you've used Google or Wikipedia to search something you didn't know the answer to. It's a lot, right? I do research every time I get a random question jammed in my head, and the computer provides immediate answers. Imagine how tough it would be without a computer to rely on when you have no idea how to answer something or complete a task. Another thing is there are online courses now for students of all ages. Some college students have to look up their assignments and how to do them on their professors web page for guidance. Also, how would students know what their homework is if they can't check the school homepage regularly? I check it almost every day when I come home from school to stay organized. It's great that the teachers care enough to post the homework and announcements online. Without computers, we'd have a higher percentage of students not doing their homework due to lack of information. A significant number out of every group of people in America has some form of online communication program they use daily. Whether it's an instant messaging service or social media, maybe even YouTube, or just a simple e-mail, practically everyone has one account or more. How else are you supposed to talk to your friends after school or coordinate plans? What do you expect us to do, call them each individually? Then we would be on the phone for hours, which is inefficient! Anybody with a teen at home knows that they prefer digital communication. Also, computers help deaf people talk through specialized programs and devices. They just type in what they want to say and out it comes through text or speech synthesis. I remember when a lady came to our school who was blind and deaf and she demonstrated how to use that special program to communicate effectively. Another reason is teachers and parents use e-mail to talk about academics and their children's progress quickly. Clearly communication is a must have in our interconnected world. Therefore, computers are a benefit to society for keeping people connected. There is no way that anybody over the age of a certain number has never played a computer game sometime in their life, as they are a common pastime. Except, of course, if they don't have internet access or choose not to engage. I know I used to play computer games, but they started to slow down my computer so my dad told me I had to stop or I can't use the computer anymore for important tasks. Woops! Still, you can use the computer to look up cheats on video games when you get stuck. Oh come on like you haven't done that at least once! Or at least your children have done it for their games. Also, you can use specific programs like presentation software or design tools to create a cover page for a project or a presentation for your corporate business, making work more professional. In other words, computers are pleasurable and practical tools for various needs. As you can see, computers are extremely educational and informative. They provide search engines to figure out anything you've ever wanted to know about, from history to science. Like, foreign places or movies and their details. Anything you can imagine. Also, we wouldn't have as much communication with people across distances without them. How would we e-mail friends in other countries without computers to bridge the gap? Finally, you can find pleasure in computers through games, videos, and creative projects. They are beneficial for work, education, and leisure, making them indispensable in today's world.
776	778	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I don't know if I am understanding correctly but are you honestly thinking about not advancing technology? Quickly rethink that because that would just be the worst mistake you could ever make. Computers can teach hand-eye coordination, they can also give you very useful knowledge. Lastly, computers help us stay close to our family and friends. First off, about ninety percent of people say that they use the computer every day so that they can increase their knowledge. This could be as simple as going on Wikipedia and discovering the latest news. This is ten times easier than going on the television and waiting for the news story you want details on. I took a survey and thirty students say that they use their computer every night so that they can read more into their social studies or science unit. Taking computer advances away is like taking learning advances away, now is that what you want? Second, Dr. Evans, a children's doctor, states, ""Computers give children that hand-eye coordination they need to enhance in sports"" I agree! Sports such as baseball, soccer, and basketball all need a great deal of hand-eye coordination. Without the hand-eye coordination, students will not do well and end up quitting. I know that if I was having trouble with sports for a long time, I would give up! If the teens gave up sports then they wouldn't have anything to keep them fit and that would lead to hundreds of kids with an obesity problem. Lastly, taking away the advancing in computers means that you are taking away family and friends connections. Computers offer many sites such as Facebook or Myspace to connect with loved ones. You can also go on Skype to chat or video chat with them. Yes, maybe computers are taking away time with family but what about your aunt or uncle in Florida that you haven't seen in over a year? Don't you want some time with them too? You can make time limits for yourself so that you don't spend your whole time on the computer. This way you can talk to all of your loved ones. Would you want to be the one crushing the emotions of a child that wants to talk to or see his grandparents? In conclusion, I remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when I was sick so that they could cheer me up. Don't take that away from me! Keep enhancing computers so that I can advance my knowledge, increase my hand-eye coordination and get to see my far away friends and family."
777	779	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Too much technology! Computers have a negative effect on people. First, our country needs to exercise more, and not just sit around, second, we aren't spending enough time caring for our environment. And third, we are losing the ability to communicate with the people around us. Our country has problems with being overweight. Most people blame it on fast food, but it's also because people sit around using computers, and don't think about staying in proper shape. Before computers were made, people were much more fit, and healthy. We need to help our country get back in shape, and take our attention away from the computer, for even just a short while, and we need to exercise! The next reason is that computers don't just have a bad effect on people, but our environment too. We spend too much time indoors with technology, and we don't even care about the world around us. Before much technology, people used to plant gardens, and trees, but now that thought hardly crosses our minds. All the electronics these days are making people forget about nature, and that needs to change. The last reason computers have a negative effect is that people don't communicate as well anymore with the people around them. If we communicate so much with people through technology, we are losing the ability to speak and communicate in person, and it ruins relationships and connections between people, like family and friends. So we need to start caring about the people around us, and not always rely on technology. In conclusion, you can see the negative effect computers have on people. We need to exercise more to improve our health. Also, we need to help our environment by reconnecting with nature. And lastly, we need to communicate better with friends and family in person. We shouldn't get rid of computers, but just step away and care about the world around you.
778	780	1	3	More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time exercising and staying healthy. Professor Smith has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than five hrs a day are overweight and do not exercise regularly. He goes on to state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obese and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age fifty. I have experienced changes in my community's health due to computers as well. Last year I had a friend who weighed one hundred fifty lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that following year he stopped exercising and gained over twenty lbs. He now is much slower and can not do more than five push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers lead to an unhealthy life style, they also cause people to spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that seventy percent of children that own a computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This may not seem like a big thing at first but this study also shows that many children who spend less time with their families grow up to become lonely. I remember when a new student came to our school. He wasn't that social of a kid and didn't have many friends but he was still doing just fine. When he came back the next year, I found out he had a computer and would keep in touch with none of his friends and barely spoke to his parents. He stayed apart from the rest of the students and didn't talk much. Then one week he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either. Finally, the teachers told us he ran away from home and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.
779	781	1	3	"Dear Mr. Jones the editor of the Springfield citizen, It has been brought to my attention from some people around Springfield that computers and technology are bad for us. I have also heard that people believe in the technology. So, the reason why I'm writing today about this issue is to put my beliefs out there. I believe that this new technology is effecting our daily exercising, playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family. Now that we have new technology with computers and such, people are distracted and do not want to exercise. This will effect our youth because we will be fat, unhealthy and sluggish all the time. Mr. Jones we don't want this to happen to our youth because we are the future and if this keeps up the state and country will suffer. Another reason is that its good to exercise and not be on the computer or watching television all the time is because exercise has been proven to make you have more energy and will feel happier most of the time. Computers do not do that for us at all. A poll even says that sixty percent of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer. Exercise won't do that at all. Since all of our new technology with televisions and other gadgets, people really don't go outside play around and enjoy nature anymore. I was asking my mother about this topic and she said, ""Kids these days just don't go outside anymore. I remember when I was your age and my mother would kick me outside at nine am and I wouldn't be back home until around five pm."" I believe that this should still happen. Maybe parents should still do this with their kids and have them run around the neighborhood with other kids. If we did this more often maybe kids and adults too will just do this naturally and will not have to rely on computers or phones for entertainment. Don't you think this is a good idea Mr. Jones? My last topic is with computers and cellphones and how we really don't interact with friends and family anymore. Now a days friends email, video chat or text each other instead of going and doing something with them. This isn't really healthy for us because we might not know how to talk to people in real life. Also if someone emails or texts you, you really don't know how their tone is because you are not talking to them face to face. Lastly I know families that get hurt by technology because that is all they do. They don't put down their phones or get off their emails and they feel like they don't see each other. This is also not a healthy relationship with family members. Mr. Jones I really hope I have persuaded you that technology is only ok to use sometimes and not every day. Remember technology is bad because we don't exercise, play outside and enjoy nature and really don't interact with friends and family members. Thank you for your time."
780	782	1	3	Dear Editor, I think computers greatly benefit society, and advance technology. They provide knowledge in a click, and entertainment after a long day of work or school. Not only that, but people have found long-lasting careers because of the invention of the computer. So obviously, computers are a great influence on society. Do you want to find out when major league baseball first came to be? Or maybe you have a history report due the next day, and your parents can't drive you to the library? This isn't a problem anymore. Computers have evolved a long way since they were invented. You can check up on your local news, by having dozens of electronic newspapers right at your fingertips. Or maybe you want to venture outside your neighborhood, and check out what's happening in London or Tokyo. News isn't the only thing the internet is useful for though. You can also go onto one of the hundreds of websites for school help, or check how the stock market is doing. Or, you can just use the handy calculator found right on your desktop. What could be better? Of course not all users have a computer for information. Many have it for entertainment purposes. In fact eighty percent of people use the computer for entertainment everyday. What, with all the fun stuff you can do, who can blame them? Social networking is placed at the top of the list. A whopping seventy-five percent of internet users use sites like Facebook or Twitter. These sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continue a conversation from thirty minutes ago. You can also use computers to watch live-streaming T.V., or that new movie you got yesterday. That's right, televisions might not be needed soon! And what would a computer be without games? There are dozens of hundreds of them scattered all across the web. How great is that? And finally, many people have found their careers through the internet. Did you know that a famous singer, Justin Bieber, was found through YouTube when his mom posted videos for the family to see when they couldn't attend performances? Of course, YouTube isn't the only way to make money. Tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find. No more wondering city streets, now you can just submit an application or have an interview without ever leaving your home. Artists have also discovered talents, by playing around with Photoshop or Illustrator. Not to mention the career paths involving computers directly, such as repairing or movie special effects. So no matter what you use a computer for, be it job hunting, entertainment, or information, they are a good idea to have in your home. There's a reason that ninety percent of households use them, and it's not just an excuse to sit around all day.
781	783	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, First of all I would like to say that I love your story and puzzles in your paper and I think I have a story you guys can use. It's about people that is addicted to computers. I guess you guys are wondering about what I mean about addiction to computers. Well I'm going to give you three reasons about this. My first reason is people aren't spending a lot of time with their family. I say this because most of the time couples get into arguments because the person that's addicted to the internet isn't doing what he or she is supposed to do. For example, say you have a turkey in the oven and you're so into the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off. Another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because of all the online chat rooms they have. I know people that's addicted to online chat rooms and I sometimes get worried about them because half of the time they don't know who they're talking to! It could be anybody, even a pedophile. My final reason is because some people just don't care. Some people can be on the computer all day and night doing nothing besides online chatting when they could be doing an essay or something helpful or caring. You know I used to be addicted to the computer myself and because of that I almost failed all my classes; because of that I don't use the computer to talk or anything such as that but now I just read my email or write my essay. And that concludes my, or should I say your next top story.
782	784	1	3	Lies! The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. They benefit us greatly for the following reasons: computers are a source of knowledge, computers can aid the advertisement and business of many workplaces, and they are a very helpful and easy way to communicate with someone across the street or across the ocean. Without a doubt computers do nothing but benefit the people of our society. First of all, computers are a big source of knowledge. Many people want answers to a question they have encountered recently but cannot find the answers in a book or newspaper so they turn to a computer and immediately their problem is solved. Computers today hold every bit of information on every topic imaginable from history to politics. All one has to do is find a site such as an online encyclopedia, type their question, and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem. Computers can also provide a place to research for a project or statistics of the economy if needed by school, business, or just for recreation. Times are changing fast and the sources of the world's history and school subjects can easily be found in the corner of the internet. What you have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on the internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. Second of all, computers and the internet support many businesses in advertising and making profit. Every single time a visit to the internet occurs many different businesses are able to advertise their products and overall businesses with pop-ups, side bars and websites. It clearly helps the workplace get attention. Along with advertising products, businesses can even sell their products online without doing a thing. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of businesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, or country can be established by the use of social networking sites. You could send a letter with the touch of a button without having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. An instant message, which can be used on any of the sites mentioned, can also be achieved. This is where you could write something down in the computer, send it to anyone and receive a reply within seconds. Obviously, computers play a big role in the communication of one to another without a problem. In conclusion, it is clear computers benefit the society greatly without a side effect at all. Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to business, and a great way of communication. Everyone has agreed to this without hesitation so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today.
783	785	1	3	Dear local newspaper, A large percentage of households own a computer. This illustrates that computers must have a positive effect on people if most people own them. I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online, learn about new things, and gives you hand eye coordination. My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online. Some people don't have phones but do have computers. If you needed to contact somebody you could do it using a computer. Also some people have family and friends who live across the world. Computers are great for keeping in touch; it also won't cost you a lot for long distance, like phones would. Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends, family, and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so. My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you don't have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things. You could do it by a click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better. Having a lot of knowledge is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because you're going to need it throughout life. If you don't have good hand and eye coordination, it is a bad thing because you use it for just about everything, such as driving, writing, and exercising. Computers give you the ability to learn eye and hand coordination throughout life which is why it is a positive thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk online to people, learn about new things and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persuades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people.
784	786	1	3	Can you imagine how difficult life would be without a computer? I can, and I believe computers are helpful. Computers help us do research, they keep us connected with friends and family, and they are required to be used at some jobs. The internet is an easy way to do research. All you have to do is search what you want information on and millions of articles will be at the click of a mouse. Using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something. That could waste a lot of time. The internet can quickly and directly answer your questions. Computers are a great way to keep connected. Almost everyone has an email now. All you have to do is type a few letters and you'll be reacquainted with an old friend. When you call someone you can't be sure if they are busy or not. When using email the person receiving the email can reply when they have free time. Computers are used at many workplaces. Sometimes you're even required to use it. Computers organize data by keeping documents in different files; computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career, such as word processing software. Using a computer would aid you financially. Some of you might think computers have misleading information. The internet isn't always an honest place. By spending a few minutes double-checking your information on other websites, you're still spending less time than it would take to find the fact in a book. The computer is one of the greatest inventions created. It makes research, connecting with friends, and your job easy! Use a computer today and your life will be changed for the better.
785	787	1	3	Dear Editor, In my opinion, spending too much time online has a negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full social experience when they talk on email, Facebook and Twitter. Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas, such as family, friends and school. They aren't being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise. Though online activity can be helpful, spending too much time can be harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can damage your social activity levels. In person interaction is better than online, because you see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is beneficial to you and your friend. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage your social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for your close family, you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing. Your relationship with your family could be in jeopardy because you insist on using your computer. When you use the computer, you're probably eating some food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off. The obesity level in our country is increasing, probable cause being over-usage of computers. Being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers; we aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our world has to offer. Online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social life, our health, and taking up too much of our time. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites are being used to interact. Why not just call or meet up with a person, instead of using the computers?
786	788	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the negative effects that computers have on kids. Computers let kids do what they want and they don't have to travel far to see certain things. Like if you wanted to see the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, you're not just going to get a plane and fly there when you could get pictures and information right on the computer in a couple of minutes. It's good if you want to see it in person, but you won't want to pay money for plane tickets or travel really far when you can just see it from home. Computers have a lot of fun stuff on them like Myspace, @CAPS2, and games; also, it's got almost everything you can think of. So why travel when you can see all of it on your computer? I think that computers can sometimes be a little addictive, but you have to learn to stay off of it most of the time, yet it is very easy to learn stuff on a computer. Computers are used by billions, and they are a great way to learn stuff about our whole world and the things that are on it. It has information websites like Google or Bing to look up anything you want. Computers are almost everywhere: in phones, iPods, and even some are put in cars like police cars. Computers are very useful to people of the world @DATE1, and I bet that the people who make them will create new ones that can go on almost everything. They have computers in almost every building like hospitals, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like RadioShack. You're going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places or even at school. In my mind, we should all have computers because they're fun and you can learn about everything you could think of, so we should all have them. Therefore, I think that computers are very useful and can teach you a lot about the things that go on in our world today, so I disagree with what scientists or people say about computers and the effects they have on certain people of @DATE1.
787	789	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, my stand on this whole computers thing is that it is becoming a big issue because people are spending all their time on computers instead of communicating with friends and family, exercising, or enjoying nature. Just like the expert mentioned in his book called @CAPS2 about computers, ""Too much time on the computers and not the recommended seven hours outside can make you very unfit."" The first reason why people should get out more is so they can have communication with friends and family. I bet you did not know that @PERCENT1 of kids from @NUM1 to @NUM2 are sitting on their couch playing video games as we speak. Another reason is that people need more exercise. More than @NUM3 of the leading citizens of the country will be obese due to little exercise, and that is mostly because of computers. And the last reason, and the most important as well, is so people can enjoy nature at its fullest. Believe it or not, but Jack Cup thinks that too; he said '@PERCENT2 of people who enjoy nature will live @NUM4 years longer and people who do not will likely have a heart attack in their @NUM5's."" That is why I think computers are bad for people, but it is not just me; it is @PERSON1, Jackup @CAPS6, scientists, and many percentages as well who agree."
788	790	1	3	Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is helpful? It provides useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as for talking to friends. If there is a child in the house, they might have to search something up on the internet for school. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can help you. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends, just tell them to use a computer! There are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans, maybe for a movie with a couple of friends, just send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, with @CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and send a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced, schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home, this will make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a parent decides to start a business from home, a computer would be required to count up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost any place on earth. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone's phone number but don't have a phone book, you can use @CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can see that computers affect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can help in multiple ways. Having a computer could give you a broader perspective of everything.
789	791	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and I just want to tell you that we should stop using computers because we get no exercise, we barely go outside, and we don't even talk to our friends or family anymore. Local newspaper, I think that we should have computers, but not to the extent we do now because many people aren't doing anything productive. Many people aren't exercising because they're talking on Facebook or playing games. Many children aren't even going outside and seeing nature and playing. Many families are all on computers and they are not spending any family time together, like going outside to fly kites. What I'm saying is that, yeah, people like computers and go on to talk to their friends and play games, but it's destroying the parents and even families. I don't think we should have so many computers. Also, local newspaper, we need to go outside and enjoy the @DATE1, and that doesn't happen because many children are on the computer. Many parents used to go hiking, camping, swimming, and lots of other stuff, but they don't do that anymore. These people need to get a change. What I'm telling you guys is to take the computer away or limit its use. One last thing, local newspaper, is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time together. Maybe if kids and parents weren't always on the computer, they would pick up on things, like if someone might be sick or ill. Maybe they might go out somewhere to have time together, like to a lake or Six Flags. Many parents think that they need a computer because it's so fun, so they use it all the time. Many people in the world complain about it. So I think everybody should be off computers more often. I think we shouldn't have a computer-dominated society because you get no exercise, you barely go outside and see nature, and you don't hang out or talk with friends and family, so I think computers should be gone now.
790	792	1	3	Computers are good for school uses, skills, and just for fun. Computers are a good source to have; now, that is just my opinion. But I think computers are mostly for pre-teens and teenagers. Adults mostly use them for business. The fun uses that the computer provides are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. @CAPS1 is one of the most popular chat groups on the internet; @CAPS2 is another popular chat group. They both have some of the same characteristics like chatting to your friends, updating your status every now and then, and uploading pictures, songs, etc. There are websites that could be used for free time, like music websites where you are allowed to watch music videos or download music onto your iPod. @CAPS3 is a website teenagers or kids go on to watch some of their favorite music videos. iTunes is the program where you can download any song, music video, TV show, or movie onto an iPod. Computers also provide Microsoft @CAPS5, Publisher, PowerPoint, etc. All these can be used for school purposes. @CAPS5 allows you to type up anything you want for school. You can type up a @NUM1 page essay if you wish. You can cut and paste pictures for a project you might have due. You can change the colors, font size, and font style on @CAPS5. That use could be for a design on the front of a cover page for an essay or project. Publisher can be used for projects as well. In school, if you need to make a newspaper, flyers, business cards, etc., Publisher allows you to make them. PowerPoint is a program where you can make different slides about anything. Computers can be put to good use for many different things. If people don't agree with that, then they don't understand that computers help children and adults with everyday things. Some kids who have special needs @MONTH1 need the computer to communicate with others. Computers, I think, are a big help in the world.
791	793	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Now as technology keeps advancing there are many educational options online, you can now interact with people without physically being with them and you can play games that will enrich your lives. Firstly, I believe that computers offer a wide variety of educational options. On the internet alone you can view your school textbook. You can also have extra practice with the many resources that come with the online textbook. Without physically bringing your textbook home you can view the book online. There are tons of extra practice, and practice quizes in the online textbook that are perfect for studying. Also, when you see on the internet you can get real time updates of major events in the world. For example, the other day I logged onto the internet and saw an article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1. I saw nothing of this in the newspaper, but the internet was so up to date that you can stay informed about something that happened only a few minutes ago. But if you choose not to utilize the internet, there are many programs that are very helpful for learning. That are direclly cetered to developing your children's math and reading skills. These programs can give anyone a jumpstart in education. Another opportunity that could be helpful on a computer is the ability to interact with other people. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 sites are very good ways to interact with people. When you video chat you can have a conversation with some on class on video! Even most they are not physically with you talk to. Instan messaging is a less direct, but still useful who talk to someone far away. You can share the news or just have a conversation with anyone you know. Lastly, social @CAPS3 sites such as facebook, and twitter are a valuable way to communicate with people. You can past messages, play games or simply talk to someone on these websites. They certainly take the best parts of online interaction and put them together. Finally, there are many online games that are very useful. If you ever wanted to go bowling but you never had the time you could play a game online. Or if you have ever wanted to drive a stock car you could play a game online. These online games are good ways to sire you the opportunity to do something you wont normally do. Also many games help sharpen your reflexes and your quick thinking skills. These could possibly cary over into the situations where you need good reflexes and quick thinking. Games could possibly be very useful when you need to prepare yourself something. Also online games are for and enjoying also. Overall I believe the computer is a valuable resource in advertion, interacting with other people and playing useful games. After all who could pass up the opportunity to better prepare yourself for life?
792	794	1	3	"Do you love technology? More and more people in this world are using so much technology and especialy computers. But not everyone agrees that this benefit society. But I do. Because it can glue people the ability to learn about anything they want to learn. Then it can give a better communication to others that lives farther away from you. My last reason is this technology can be a good way of protecting this country. Now I agree that computers can be useful man made sorce. When I was about @NUM1 years old I loved to play on the computer I thought that this was just a game. But my dad told me that do not abuce the computer, use it for education. I found out that theres so many things to teech about just a click of a botton. Now you can use this technology as a tool not a game. You might not want to go to the library to find a book you can just look it up in the computer. People love to talk to others, to meat new people or just comunicate to others who live in a other country. One of the best ways are on the computer. I am @NUM2 years old and I have alot of friends that chat on the computer, and I am one of them. My family members live in @LOCATION1, and I just can't catch, a plane every day to go visit them. So I just go on the computer and talk to them it's one of the fastest ways and fun ways to. The @ORGANIZATION1 has one of the strongest @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION3 in the world. You would not believe the technology they have and how they use them. One of the best things they have is the ""@PERSON1."" @CAPS1 a plane drivin by a remote control. It's just like a fighter plane but without a pilot! The person controling it can relax in bace wile the @PERSON1 does all the work now come and join me to say that computers are useful in this world! From the reasons above, I state that computers are useful because they give people the ability to learn about anything they want. It gives' a way to comunicate. Last @CAPS1 a good way to protect this country. Technology is growing faster by the minute and strogger. So take my word ""don't abuse it, use it."""
793	795	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great effect on people. Computers are useful for homework, it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family, you can also look up direction and information to a place. Computers are good for last minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial. While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work; there's no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school you can go to the school's website and find out the homework. Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to? If so wouldn't you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all! Some examples are aim, emails, and other networks and they don't cast money at all its free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well if there's a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers. Not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. It can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students averages easier and faster and children can do their homework efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall computers are useful.
794	796	1	3	Isn't it great getting a refreshing when your outside? Wouldn't you experiences the rush of jumping into the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 instead of sitting inside, gazing at pictures of the @LOCATION1? You might think that computers are helping society today, but you are wrong. The human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more. Computers are helping society become more and more lazy. We can get just as much information out of books if we try our best. Hand-eye coordination is important, and we can get it though activities, such as football, and tennis. We can also get it from activities! Drawing, reading, and even playing an instrument can all improve hand-eye coordination while letting you explore your creative side. Some people believe that computers teach hand-eye coordination, and it can but there are better ways to get it. It would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity. Many people like to travel in all different places of the world, but going to a foreign area with no knowledge don't smart at all. So what do you do? Go the most convinient source, internet. But what if I told you that any person could put anything on the internet? You could be getting info on @LOCATION3 when you think you're getting info on @LOCATION2. The most reliable source would be from a book. Reading is very powerful, especially if you're reading from a good source. Kids lately have been making lives on the internet. The only way they communicate is through online chat. Chatting online can/should never replace time in person with friends. Relationships with others online is never real. We're using our knowledge of how to communicate with others. The internet isn't worth it. So as you can see computers are no good. Thank you.
795	797	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are an advance in technology, in a good way. They do benifit are society grately. Its a way that family members can keep in touch, it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work. They can bring people together. Firstly, they are a great way to keep in touch. In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him. Do you have someone, you don't get to see everyday? It can really make your family closer, because you talk more, with your realitives, and with friends. Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them. In a time of pain all you want is a friend. When the friends away, a computer probably helped our, too, just getting there. Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal, waitting on the phone for hours, at end, with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes. I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but didn't know until, she went on the computer and checked. So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not. With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like. It well even say if there delayed so you don't wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likly. Yes once you were happy you had a computer. On the other hand, it also helps with your education. When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out, mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat. About nine out or ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know thats happened to me. As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned. You could use your computer. Most schools use some or device, here at @CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post, grades, test/quizs coming up and homework. It's just one click away from every thing we need. It all right there, together. Most @CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come, in with there homework then without. Wouldn't you be? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there. In conclusion, computers do help us from everyday use. to special uses. It helps use make are family stronger, help us keep are flight out and help us get homework, for school the next day. Computers are a help to the society, in a great and convienent way.
796	798	1	3	"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself ""she is always on that computer, doesn't she have work to do?"". I said to my mom ""I think we should have an hour or two on the computer each night, or not have one at all."" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internet and computers are very dangerous nowadays. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is them or not. It could be an older man or woman trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. They could steal from you and do worse things. Now I watch the news and see many kidnappings because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot of trouble. Maybe if she had met him she would have gotten very hurt and been scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families nowadays. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated on their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time for family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she is spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on websites like Facebook or Myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glued to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go to a gym. The rate of obesity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend too much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, ""no""... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get fit and at what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours on the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids safety from bad people out there in the world, for spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to pursue them in their own life and convince others too."
797	799	1	3	Dear Editor of the local paper, I'm writing a letter to tell you about the effect of computers on people in society. I think that computers help society learn and helps people to talk to others around the world. Computers help society learn about faraway areas of the world, to learn about the history of an area, and to study animals and habitats unable to reach without travel. Computers make it easier to learn about areas that are hard to research like deep sea trenches and the cliffs of the Andes in South America, allowing us to learn about the history of an area or cities of ancient civilizations like the Roman Empire in Italy. They help us study animal species and the habitats they call home like the Bengal Tiger in India or the species called the Mountain Gorilla. Computers help society learn about all this. Computers also help people talk to others around the world; like you can hold a conference on your computer when you are home. It is easier to talk and ask questions with others while you are on vacation, and you don't have to pay to travel to a place to have a conference with others. You can hold a conference on your computer from home when you can't make a trip. It's easier to talk and ask questions about something important to your business. You can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there. This is how computers help people talk with others around the world. This is how computers help society learn and talk to others around the world.
798	800	1	3	Dear Newspaper, People use computers in their everyday lives, and having computers has become customary to many people throughout the world. We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment; in all these ways computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, and connections with people from just about anywhere, but some of us become too attached to this virtual life instead of living our own real lives. This happens to many people; some don't even notice what computers are doing to them. For most people, life can be challenging and the real world too stressing, so they retire to the computer for awhile, and to me this is fine, but when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer; this would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think; they need exercise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game, and sure, in some ways, it is. But it could reach its full potential by doing something else that's not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life? Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a destruction. This can happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Nowadays people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't necessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets. So what I'm saying is that talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends and have real people come first. Like I said in the beginning, computers are part of our everyday life, and it's not a bad thing; they can be very helpful. But you must control what you do on them and how much you use them. If you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle, making you, your friends, and family a whole lot happier.
799	801	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, as you might have heard on the news, more and more people think computers are the benefits of society. I personally disagree with them. I think that they are making people miss out on new things, miss out on meeting new people, and look out on exercise. Time flies by fast. Things can fly over your head and you might not notice them. Have you ever been on a computer for an hour? It might have felt you were on for only twenty minutes. Many people have been on it for a whole day. You could have missed a year of stuff. New things like the new ipod nano with camera being invented and you would not have known. Also, the ipod. You could download books and read them on there. There are also new things to try like jumping out of a plane or bungy jumping. You could be going to new places around the world. Traveling to Paris, Rome or even under water. Even going to Italy and having a melting, warm, right out of the oven tasty cheese pizza. My mouth is grumbling for just thinking about it. How many people do you know? What about on facebook or myspace? That is not enough; you should go to the park. Meet some people. Just going to a family house, you can be interacting. Everyone should be interacting with someone. Even two year olds need to interact with other two year olds. That is how they learn how to share toys; you're not two anymore but it's good to know someone. Learning how others think too. You might think your way is good and the other person's way is not. That is called interacting and talking about it. You might see on the news how many families have someone in the family having weight problems. Many shows like the biggest loser on television are trying to help these people lose weight. But what causes this? It could be not eating right, or not exercising right. But the problem could do with computers. Many people are spending sixty minutes on the computer, than only ten minutes exercising. Just a quick walk around the block can make you lose at least one hundred calories. Others might rather stay on the computer and gain one hundred calories. And some deaths are caused by a heart attack. This might be caused by plaque build up or weight gain. Instead of reaching for an apple many Americans reach for junk foods. I think we should still use computers but cut down the times we use it and exercise and eat more. You might think after reading this letter that people won't listen about exercising and meeting new people or places. But, the one thing we can do is to at least inspire one person. That person can inspire another person. This can go on and on. Little by little we can help people see what they can do without using a computer.
800	802	1	3	Dear local newspaper, The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit society. I used to think they didn't benefit society but now I think they do. I think this because they are one good place to get information, two we live in a technologically advanced society, and three you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world. So do computers really benefit our society? Computers are a valuable resource for me when I need to get information. For example, in my recent project in social studies class I needed to go on the computer to get information on the subject. Also if you need facts on something and you can't go to the library the computer has the same information. Also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store. The computer is and always will be a great source of information. In the modern day, technology is a huge part of society. For example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in a cardboard card. Now we have thin and small portable computers. So knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the times. So are you going to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch. For example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket. But if you go on a website like facebook you can talk for free. Also another way to chat with people is by A.I.M., another free way to talk to people. What sane person wouldn't want to talk to their friends and family across the world, for free? The reasons I have given you are valid reasons with details. Technology is like a train; are you going to let it leave without you?
801	803	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers do not benefit society. They do more bad than good in my opinion. People aren't on the computer to research people. They are on to check @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5. They need to get outside and see the outside world, people should interact with family and friends. Humans that have too much time on their hands become bored, and so maybe they will make a @CAPS3 account or, if they already have one, they will maybe play one of the games on there and eventually you get addicted to @CAPS3 and you never go off of it. Our society needs to encourage people to get outside and only use your computer to check your email, add something to your ipod, and maybe check if you have any notification on @CAPS3. If you want to really have a great life, sitting in front of the computer your entire life isn't going to let you have that kind of fun. Ya need to live your life like your going to die tomorrow. Get outside, watch the big game with all your buddies. Go on a vacation get away with your family. Travel the world and remember every part of it. Wouldn't you rather be doing that then to be sitting in front of your computer? We need to inform our state about this problem. There is a reason why we are becoming one of the fastest growing countries in terms of obesity! People are not leaving their house and not getting active. If people avoid their computers then we could be one of the fittest countries, but right now we are moving in the wrong direction.
802	804	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have on people are not good. They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day, leading to an unhealthy lifestyle. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life, which can damage real relationships. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do harm to you. It's not safe at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are just some of the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before and I know how hard it can be to break away from the screen.
803	805	1	3	"School, family, and sports is what @CAPS5 my mom always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for everything @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 to do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about what @CAPS5 happened on the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complete their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said ""you do not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic."" What @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obese and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to that, students need to pass their @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy for their own future well-being."
804	806	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion about computers is good. I think that they can help people with what they need. People can also also contact other people easily. All computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it. Computers help teachers, students, employees, and parents with their daily tasks. They aren't always for just helping with work. Computers can also be used for amusement and relaxation. Games, music, and videos are always on the internet for entertainment. Contacting other people is also a great reason why computers aren't bad. People can always have an e-mail for business and friends to stay in touch. Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all websites that people can contact others and share their lives. Having a computer isn't always bad. When you do a story for the newspaper does it come out hand written? No, you also use the computer to do work and make it look professional. Computers aren't always bad. People have to learn to just limit their time on them. They can always be a positive affect on people when they need something quickly. Information on anything is always on the internet, ready to be found. Computers have been used for decades and I think they will be used for many many more years to come. Back then people used computers mostly for work and calculations. Now people of all ages can use it for all different kinds of things, from learning to playing.
805	807	1	3	"Computers. An achievement of technology and science that improve all of our lives. They let you explore the world in one click and chat with your friends. What could be wrong with that? I'll tell you. I believe that computers are ruining our society. Now don't get me wrong, I like them, but they can be bad. People get on and never get off, you never know who it is your chatting with online, and they can cause tons of stress. Let me explain why computers can ruin lives. When the computer was invented I'm sure this wasn't the purpose. To stay on playing mindless games, or randomly searching the web. Some scientists have even studied that @PERCENT1 of the time, the more you are online, the more likely chance you will become obese. That is not what @LOCATION1 needs. You say you'll be on for a minute, but you will stay playing ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" for days on end. People with important work to do might never get it done. Also it is just flat out a waste of time when you could be outside playing a real game. My second reason is that when you are ""chatting"" or ""@CAPS4'ing"" someone, who is it really? A study conducting proved that when you think your talking to a friend it is really some perverted @NUM1 year-old looking for ""fun."" Scary @CAPS5 huh? Also when you talk, someone could be embedding a virus in your system that could take money to fix. How mad would your parents be? It could be happening with every letter you press. Finally stranger or not, some of these people leave links to get to disgusting websites that you pray your parents don't see. My final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress. When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty feuds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damage to your grades. For every @NUM2 people who join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, affecting their quality of work. In this economy I don't think we need more layoffs. Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 of people in @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get you sucked in, stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right and in moderation. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad for individuals and for society as a whole."
806	808	1	3	"Hello @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you think computers are having a great effect on people? Well, I sure @CAPS3 think using a computer has a great effect on people. I say this because, people are probably waisting a full day on those facebook, myspace gol websites, looking up diffenitions for words, directions to places etc. If you think about it, this effect on people can ruin their eye-site, and social skills. These people are spending like @NUM1 hours tops on the computer, just sitting in one place. Staring at that @NUM2 inch little screen can damage your eye-site, causing strain and headaches. This can lead you to getting glasses or possibly going blind over a long period. How would your life be without not talking to a girl/guy or even your own family? If you waist your time on those websites for example: facebook all you @CAPS3 is instant message the person, which isn't real conversation. Maybe you should go out and @CAPS3 something fun with that person, like seeing a movie or having a real chat. What's this I hear about map it.com? Don't be lazy and waist @NUM3 minutes at your day just getting directions. Use a a real map and learn to navigate for yourself! Also, free @LOCATION1? Come on! Use a real dictionary and learn the words properly. So, I come to my conclusion by saying that these computers @CAPS3 have a ""great effect""on people. It gives them short cuts through life, making them lazy and less capable."
807	809	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers do not benefit society. They make people antisocial, unhealthy, and do bad things. The internet is very addictive and hard to stop using once you start. I use to spend three hours online everyday, just browsing and chatting. I did not get any exersice at all, and my muscles became weak. Also, I was incouraged to eat unhealthy snacks like chips and soda while online. This made me very unhealthy I gained nine pounds in one week, which was shocking. Now, I have dietbeaties and must watch everything I eat. I can't enjoy things like sweets or running without feeling sick. I will probably have arthritus in my hands when I'm older because I spent hours typing away on the keyboard. I used the computer in the dark so now I need contacts to see properly. Using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever, leading to a sedentary life. II spent so much time on the computer i wasn't able to socialized in person. I missed out on alot of activities with my friends and family, like birthdays and outings, because I was so busy online. I barely talked to anyone unless it was through email, which felt empty. I lost alot of friends and close family members who got tired of my absence. My pets died because I didn't take care of them, forgetting to feed them. I didn't really want to do anything but go on the net, ignoring my responsibilities. I messed up on colledge and job interviews because I was unprepared and distracted. To this day I have no social life and no job because I spent more time socializing with the computer than people. Computers ruined my life and took away my future. Computers incourage very bad things, not just unhealthy choices and antisocial behavior they uncourage things against the law. Alot of drugs and weapons are bought online from shady websites. People kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online, spreading rumors. People don't care for nature and destroy it by wasting resources on technology. People steal so they can buy extra technology, like new phones and laptops. Alot of car robbers happen because someone left technology in there, attracting thieves. People gamble through online poker, losing their savings. People hack bank acounts through the computer, stealing money. Prostitution happens because of online chats arranging meetings. Thier are sex affenders that go online posing as people that want a date when they are rapists, tricking victims. Terrorists can communicate by the internet to plan attacks. Computers are a menace to society and cause many problems. They turn people into low life scums and criminals who break the law. Computers should disposed of before they cause the end of the world by destroying our social fabric.
808	810	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I belive that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework and make learning easier. Computers also let people learn new things they are curious about. You can even communication with friends who live far away. There are many great uses for a computer that improve daily life. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all on time. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month that requires research. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat and presentable. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat with typing and formatting. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it, allowing for quick edits. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done efficiently. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer, which is like having a library at home. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning new skills and facts. There are many educational websites on computers that offer lessons and tutorials. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet and read all about it. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it instantly. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it, keeping people connected. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat which are all popular tools. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or share updates, or videochat also to talk to friends face-to-face virtually. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country without high costs. These are all great ways to use computers to stay in touch. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people and make life better. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends across distances. Computers are great tools that everyone can benefit from when used wisely.
809	811	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 computers are useful they have a negative affect on people. Due to the advance in computers many people do not go outside as much anymore, preferring to stay indoors. People are so busy with computers that they dont even spend quality time with their friends and family anymore, ignoring those around them. Obesity is also a big issue that is growing because of computer use. Computers are ruining peoples expierence with the great outdoors and all it has to offer. Many peope, mostly kids stay inside all day playing video games on computers instead of being active. Outside there is great things to do like go to the park or play sports that are healthy and fun. Computers are just taking away from kids and now they dont get to expierence the fresh outside fun and are now a days kids in the @DATE1 stay inside all day, instead of going to fun outside camps where they can learn and play. Families now a days are being broken up due to computers and the distraction they cause. The parents or even kids are not spending lots of time with each other due to the computers, leading to arguments. As a result the family starts to lose the bond between each other familys can also develop these ways, youth most likely get attracted to computers, so its either the son or daughter who are not emotionally or physically contacting with the family which is a problem for relationships. Health is a big issue when it comes to computers and the lack of activity. Whats happening is teenagers or even adults are sitting at the computer playing these games or surfin the web then eating dinner then continueing to surf the web or play the games without moving. After time the starts to become worse and worse and the kids gain weight and keep gaining wait then become obese and unhealthy, which is dangerous. This is a problem all over america, that is technology keeps advancing and advancing the youth will become very unhealthy and unfit. In conclusion, computers have a very negative affect on people and their well-being. People are not going outside as much anymore to enjoy nature. Families relationships are being ruined by lack of communication and peoples health is at steak due to inactivity! If this does not change americas future will be at risk with a generation of unhealthy people.
810	812	1	3	"some people learn about far away places, getting the latest up-dates on important news, and making sloppy work and hand writing seem nice neat. All those thing are some positive benefits people have computers for in their lives. People all over use computers to research other places they are interested in visiting or learning about. computers provide photographs of the place he/she is researching, making it visual and real. For example: I remember when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1, and I had to explain why its a great place to visit for its history and culture. Mind I never even heard on a place called the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, but thanks to computers I googled ""@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1"", then the computer gave me all of info. and photos about the mountain @CAPS1 that I needed. Now I @CAPS2 where and what the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 moutans look like, which was amazing to see. Secondly, the computers has all the latest news happening all over the world, updated by the minute. I remember when the earthquake in haiti first happened my grandmother had it happen until she got on line to check @ORGANIZATION1 and found out when, where and earthquake on the richter scale it occurred, keeping her informed. about computers was a I wasn't the best hand writer in class, and could write it out messy or do it on the computer, plus we were getting graded on neatness, elaboration, and fluency which mattered a lot. I choose to do it on the computer it came out nice and neat with picturs that impressed my teacher. computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide, helping them in many ways. now matter if its for info on projects, news events, or to make thing neates and presentable, computers are a great help for everyone."
811	813	1	3	Dear local newspaper, do you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't love to go on the computer? Well, Myspace, Facebook, and AIM are like an online hangout. Kids everywhere log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. I firmly believe that computers have a major effect on people; my three reasons are people don't get enough exercise, they don't interact with others, and kids are sneaky—they will sneak on if they are supposed to be doing research or if they weren't allowed. Online websites and games are like hypnotizing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents believe that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however, kids are and would sneak to play online games or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasn't on before. Sometimes the best thing to do is to get some fresh air and interact with others. But with websites that make people stay connected for more than two hours, they don't get fresh air and they don't interact with others. Most times people forget and don't know what something is except for how a computer works because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, and sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat there; they won't get enough exercise, they will start to get fat, and soon can only stay at the computers because they didn't exercise to burn the fat off. So you see how computers have a major effect on people by not interacting with others, not having enough exercise, and kids being sneaky and going on other websites they were not allowed to visit, especially if their parents weren't home to supervise them.
812	814	1	3	Dear editor, I don't think that computers are something that people should be using all the time. Computers have something to them where somehow they become addictive. From the people who are gaining weight every day because they sit on the computer and chat all day. Then there are those terrible people on the internet who disguise themselves so they look like a twelve-year-old boy when they are really a fifty-year-old man. Lastly, people nowadays are using the computer as a source of reading instead of books. I just think that computers are ruining the life of many people. For starters, most people today are becoming overweight because they either watch too much television, or they sit on the computer and eat all day. Once you start with the computer you'll never stop. Especially if you're multi-tasking where you eat and use the computer. The big problem is people think it's better to be sitting home than out enjoying nature and exercising! It really isn't good that people don't get off the computer and start enjoying life. Next, not everyone online is who they say they are; people make false accounts on sites like Myspace or Facebook. There can be men who say they are teenagers and really be adults. With all the posting of pictures, someone can trick you with it. Just remember to be careful! Lastly, people in today's day and age use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or Barnes and Noble (or any book store). I think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology nowadays. When I was younger and I said that I was going to read a book, I was really reading one. I wasn't reading it on the computer. People need to cut down on the electronics. In the end, I think that computers are a real waste of time. There is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercising. Everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online. Also, can we please start using normal books instead of online ones? I think computers need to stop taking over our world and start just being there when we need them.
813	815	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Computers today have a negative effect on people. The valuable time of getting daily exercise is reduced, you will not see your family enough, and some of the costs are outrageous! Owning a computer is surely not a good idea. Is sitting around all day your idea of a workout? Having a computer would be very bad for your physical lifestyle. Clicking a mouse and typing away are only moving your hands, not your whole body. An individual who doesn't use the computer daily, or for large amounts of time, would be healthier than someone who always uses the computer. I remember seeing a commercial about two children and how their lives ended up later on in life just by their computer usage as a ""tween."" Not only will you be unhealthy, but anti-social behavior is probable too. Many kids, or even adults, spend precious family time playing The Sims or creating their own ideal family. This, however, is not acceptable. Spending time with your family is something precious. When asked about computer usage, a friend said, ""you could easily become addicted with just a few turns!"" If you are addicted, both your family and you suffer. They will stop inviting you places. You wouldn't want to lose the people who are going to be there for you, on another note. ""Warning!"" shouts your computer. You have another virus. Uh oh, it's deleting your hardware: all your scholastic essays, important book-marked websites, and sentimental photographs. Do you have any idea how much it would cost to even try to retrieve this data? Well, it'd be a lot. I know you're probably thinking, ""This couldn't happen to me,"" but in reality, yes it can. Storing things on a computer is much riskier than having a hard copy. It will also save you more money. Furthermore, appliances use electricity when they're even plugged into an outlet! So when you get your electric bill, don't be surprised; computers can be very costly, which is why it's not worth it to have one. Computers are just another unnecessary thing in life. They will take away from your over-all health, reduce family time, and cost you some big bucks. It is a fact that you can survive without a computer. But without health? Well, you'd be dead. I ask you to consider my ideas."
814	816	1	3	"Dear Editor, I am a student at a middle school in the United States. You recently produced an article about whether computers were good or bad for people; I write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. This is true because computers help people with things like hand-eye coordination, to learning advances in our schools, and finally, it helps people communicate with ease. Please consider the following. First of all, computers help hand-eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using their hands and eyes together. A study from a university stated, ""Computers help hand-eye coordination twenty percent more than putting your son or daughter on the football team."" Computer games could help kids get more accurate with their skills or that of any sport. So now you know why computers help people develop better hand-eye coordination. Secondly, computers help people learn new things. Although people might think this to be false, it is indeed true. A recent study at an institute shows that ninety percent of schools in the country use computers for research. Finally, I recently had a paper about a historical figure and the only source I thought of was Wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. So now you understand the computer is a helpful learning tool. Finally, the computer is a great way to communicate online. It is better than a telephone because it is faster and more efficient than calling someone up and talking for a long time. It is a lot cheaper than a phone because you just have one payment a month, unlike a phone bill where it starts to add up. In fact, a professor in a recent study said that ""telephones are obsolete now; with the internet, people can chat at lightning speed."" Finally, using e-mail or Facebook is so much better than phone tag; on Facebook you know where you can chat with friends. So that's my reasons that the computer is good for communicating. So now you see that computers are necessary because they develop hand-eye coordination, they help people learn, and finally, they are a great way to communicate."
815	817	1	3	Dear Editor, A recent concern has built up among experts that computers today have negative effects on society. I do not agree with this. Computers ease life, teach you about faraway places and people, and finally, you can chat with others. I believe computers can only benefit a society. As previously mentioned, computers ease the hassles of life. With computers, you are able to plan your life with calendar output. This program enables you to enter data on places you have to go and reminds you when it is time for that event. With this program, you will never forget where you have to go. Also, with the computer, you are able to gather information at extremely high speeds. Suppose you are doing a research project in school on types of cars; you just enter cars on a search engine and get millions of results. This saves much more time than going to the library and finding a book, which can take up to an hour. Finally, with a computer handy, there are programs for special needs people to write. New programs such as word processors have a special function called voice commands. This lets a person who cannot write because of blindness or a disability speak to the computer what he or she wants to write. In an instant, it will pop up on the screen. Computers ease people's lives drastically. Besides easing lives, computers teach you about faraway places and people. Pictures on a computer give one a firsthand account of what a faraway place is like. Instead of just reading about it, you can see it. According to Time Magazine, if a person sees a place, they will learn more by thirty percent than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another firsthand account of the place. Finally, ebooks on the internet give you a large amount of information. Ebooks are books but in an internet format. These books include encyclopedias that give statistics, poems, and events that are in the far-off place. For example, if you are planning a trip, you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. You can learn about far-off places and the people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers, you can talk to people around the world. You can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can easily do so with video chat. Not only can you talk to someone, you can see them. I remember two years ago when I moved to a new town, I missed my friends in my old town so I video chatted with them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a business meeting around the world without having to travel out of your town. For example, if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in another country, they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save the time and money of traveling. Also, you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example, a reporter a few weeks ago video chatted many people in a disaster area to understand how bad conditions were after the earthquake. You can talk to people with ease with a computer available. In conclusion, I believe computers are beneficial to a society. They ease life, teach people about faraway places and the people who live there, and allow people to talk to others. Computers open doors in the world. Computers help society a great deal.
816	818	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, you think computers are bad for society. It has come to my attention that many people are concerned that computers are not very good, but in my opinion I think computers are beneficial. They help with typing skills. Computers are also very helpful with editing and cropping pictures, and they make it easy to find information. First of all, computers are very helpful with typing skills. Other people who don't use computers might take six years to learn, but @PERCENT1 of teens can type in a minute, whereas someone else might take @NUM1 minutes. Computers have a great effect on many people with their typing skills. Computers make it so you can copy, edit pictures, and do many more tasks. Why edit pictures from an expensive digital camera when you can do it for free on your computer? A computer makes it easy to sift through a lack of information; you can just use the computer and find it faster. The computer allows you to look for information and find it more quickly. For example, you have to do a project on @CAPS4. Instead of going to the library and spending money on a book about @CAPS4, you can go on google.com and type in @CAPS4. You get so much information and it is so much faster. Get with the program computers are in. In conclusion, I think computers are a great invention. They make it easier to find information and improve typing skills. Also, they make it so much easier to crop and edit photos, so please take my suggestions seriously.
817	819	1	3	Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think the opposite though. I think this way because you @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer one day. Some jobs you have to apply for by computer. Another thing is a computer allows you to talk online with other people. The first reason why I think using a computer is good for people is because you @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer one day. What I mean by this is you might have to look up a job, you might want to get away so you look up vacations that you can take, or you might have to pay a bill one day. The second reason why I think using a computer is good is because some jobs you have to apply for by computer. Such as Stop and Shop, Price Right, and Save-A-Lot. To add on to that, this is good for our society because if we use paper, that's killing more trees. The third reason why I think using a computer is good is because it allows you to talk online with other people. Therefore you @MONTH1 need to contact a family member or even an old friend, meet new people, or you might not like to talk on the phone, so you would rather talk by computer. Now I have told you all the reasons why I think using a computer is good. You @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer, some jobs you have to apply for by computer, and lastly it allows you to talk online with other people. These are some good pros, so I hope you take my opinion into consideration.
818	820	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I want to tell you why I'm a little bit against computers. There are a lot of things you can do in the world, like visit places and go on cruise ships. First I would like to tell you about the things you can do; you can play basketball, handball, or hang with your friends. Also you can take your car and go out for a morning drive to feel the breeze. Next I would like to tell you about the places you can visit; you can visit your friend's house, your girlfriend or boyfriend, or your family. Just do that and stop being lazy; computers aren't helping you with your life, so stop being lazy. Finally I would like to tell you about the cruise ships; you can go far away to places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and many more. It's fun on a cruise ship with the captain's dinner and you can meet @ORGANIZATION1 people and see @ORGANIZATION1 sights. In conclusion, I would say people should stop being lazy on computers and have fun in the world while it lasts.
819	821	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe, myself, that computers are extremely important to our society in this day and age. Computers help people talk with people online and keep in touch with family and friends. Secondly, I think that computers are important because they help with learning, even online schooling. Lastly, computers just help with the need for entertainment for people. Computers are one of the most used tools on the planet. Almost every family has one, and some people even have more than @NUM1. Let's face it, there are many people traveling around the world, just trying to make a decent living for their families. Computers help them keep in touch, whether it's by emailing them or even video chat. This makes people happy and still keeps them informed about what their family members or friends are up to. For some people, it can re-unite family, by someone searching for, I don't know, maybe their long-lost brother or something. Computers keep families together, and you might just get a little surprise every now and again! We should keep computers because of this. Lastly, computers can just be plain fun! Maybe you're looking for some funny videos; just go on and search ""funny videos"", and it will keep you busy for a while. I know that I enjoy downloading music, too, so why should it be any different for other people? If there is a song going through your head, just look it up and I'm sure you'll find what you are looking for. You @MONTH1 be cooking and need a recipe for something; I am sure your computer is more than willing to tell you whatever you please. All right, so computers are one of the most important tools of this world that we live in today. We depend on computers for many things, like keeping in touch with family, helping people learn things, and providing entertainment, just to name a few. Computers can help with countless things."
820	822	1	3	I think that you can never spend enough time on the computer; I feel there is no bad effect computers can have on you, they only improve your life, and here is why. For one thing, if you need to find out an important fact, date, or time, you can just look it up on the computer. The internet is a never-ending source of knowledge and you can learn just about anything that you need to know just by searching it on the computer. Another useful thing the computer does is provide the ability to talk to people using either @CAPS1-mail, @CAPS2, or chat rooms. You can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relative on the computer, and you can even hook up a web camera and actually see them as they talk to you, something a phone cannot do. Also, the computer is a good source of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even download console games onto your computer. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies; like if you were following a television series and you missed an episode, you can just go look it up. And a favorite of mine is YouTube; whether you watch random videos, watch famous YouTube stars, or post videos of your own, there is always fun to be had. And finally, all the programs on the computer; there is an endless amount of programs you can have downloaded. They can be for fun, such as Paint and Flash, or they can be important like Word or Notebook. Every program the computer offers is useful and fun to use, and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real world. Now I have mentioned some of the many reasons why you can never spend enough time on the computer. Sure, exercise and nature can be healthy, but you can do some of that stuff I just mentioned by taking a nature walk. So won't you agree computers improve our life more than they are unhealthy?
821	823	1	3	Some experts are concerned about people using computers and not enjoying nature and going outside. In my opinion people should use the computers but not a lot. It's fine to use the computer to chat with friends, search some stuff you never seen, or for completing school assignments. I say this because some people get addicted to computer games, or talking to your friends the whole day. Next reason is to go outside, you can enjoy more stuff like sports, tag, and other activities. Instead of talking to a friend on the computer go to the park and talk or invite them over to you house. Another reason why I the experts are right about people and computers is to learn about nature and learn how to do things. I hope you have found my introduction good and reading on. My first reason is people getting addicted to computer games and other computer features. The reason I say this is because some people do get addicted on computer, it's fine to go on it some time's but not to much. It is better to go outside you got fresh air its nice and cold. If you have a dog you should take for a walk or walk with your friends. My next reason is going outside playing sports or running around playing tag. Instead of using the computer you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are so many fun thing's you can do outside. You should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at. That way when you get bored there is always something to do, instead of being home all day. The last reason why I prefer nature over computers is learning on how to do something. It's better to learn stuff in real life than in computer's. Your dad can teach you how stick bricks together to make a chimney, or on how to use a lawn mower to cut other peoples yard's to make money. In the end, balancing computer use with outdoor activities leads to a healthier and more fulfilling life.
822	824	1	3	"Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. My opinion is computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards my side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, my first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has blue skies, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fall has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The good of it is you can get those chores done. Oh not that make me to. My next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. My next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exercising. Exercising is a very fun thing to do, you feel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many more. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. If you don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise is a main piece of staying healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, do karate, climb a mountain, etc. The possibilitys are endless while exercising in the park you never knew you can meet. cars fast say your friend, ""yo sup man,"" ""not, you"" ""not much, just fiding around for some exercise"" ""same here, same here"" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was my friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was inside on the computer. Like i said be what was my friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So my last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love my family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with family and friends."
823	825	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is kids might have to write an essay for school. My second reason is kid might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. My first reason is kids might have to write an essay for school. Teachers mostly prefer to have the kids type their essays. When kids write essays they have to get information on what they are looking for, and a computer helps them do research and type neatly. My second reason is kids might have to look important things on. They might have to fill out an application out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they might want to go to. Kids in high school look up colleges to get into when they are in like ninth or tenth grade. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. When kids check their e-mails they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote them. Also some kids don't live near family so they e-mail each other on-line to stay connected. My first reason is kids might have to write an essay for school. My second reason is kids might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have an e-mail. Now I hope you like the reasons I wrote on why computers are good to have for students and their schoolwork.
824	826	1	3	"Dear Principal, as a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. Sites like Facebook help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. But, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with social networking. With the technological revolution came games like World of Warcraft. These games are addicting, and our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by university students, ""three out of five teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, social inadequacy, and obesity. As a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on end, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. As aforementioned, obesity is another issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, vitamin D deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the diseases brought on by computers can be helped by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, as a species we were not meant to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is acquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practically robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our social interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their overall well-being."
825	827	1	3	I think computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very important to society. You can still interact with Your Family and friends either in online chat or through video calls. Computer are also helpful for applying for jobs like you can look for jobs you like. You can do school exercises and they are useful for writing essays. If you have a laptop you can bring it anywhere you want you don't have connect anything it take wireless and you can connect to the internet. You can look up stuff on the internet for your homework and other stuff. Buy things without having to go to the store, which saves a lot of time and effort. These are reasons why computers have a positive affect on people, making daily tasks and communication much easier and more efficient.
826	828	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowledge. But, many people do not think about the negative effects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, and they organize data well and quickly. Computers make communication easy, but there are many negative effects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, but they can also be dangerous. More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside exercising and communicating with friends and family. Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults. Kids use them to talk with friends, make plans, and catch up with relatives. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know what's going on outside of the office. There are many other useful advantages of computers. Some other advantages of computers are the computers' functions. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Other pluses about computers, are that they can teach hand-eye coordination. Typing can help the majority with this. Typing is also another advantage. If people don't have great penmanship, they can use a computer to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher. There are many advantages to computers, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending their free time on the computer, instead of outside exercising. This is causing kids to become less active. Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abbreviations for words and phrases, such as ""idk"" for ""I don't know"". This language is damaging how kids read and write. Although chat rooms on computers can be useful, they can also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves, such as their age. Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they get information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. This is extremely dangerous and unfortunately, it does, and has happened. As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages. I believe, if people can find a balance between them, people will agree more about computers. In my opinion computers are handy, but dangerous. If kids are more careful online, and spend more time outside than on the computer, there would be less controversy. Parents would be less concerned about their child's safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online, and also what kids say in their profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less drastic over a period of time, and people would be more comfortable with the role of computers in our lives."
827	829	1	3	Computers are an amazing technology to life. It's amazing because the computer helps lots of people and jobs. The people it helps are kids in school to look up an area they need to find for a question on a worksheet. Also the jobs it helps is the police, @CAPS1.W.A.T and the @ORGANIZATION1. It helps the police and @CAPS1.W.A.T to find where people are and where they'll be. The @ORGANIZATION1 uses computers to locate where they will attack or defend. If it wasn't for computers we wouldn't have found @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The bad thing about computers are hackers and people that won't get off their computers. They are obsessed with the computer and they are so obsessed they sleep with the computer. That's the parents' fault. Those are the only bad things about computers. They get people fat and lazy because they only want to be on the computer. The computer also has good ways to reconnect with family and friends over the years you haven't seen them. The computer controls lots of things like the nuclear bomb, security, secret-files, satellites, all of @CAPS5.A.@CAPS1.A. and more. They control life in a major part. People shouldn't be concerned about kids that sit there next to a computer all day because it's the person's fault; they ruined their lives and the parent's fault mainly for not controlling their kid with staying away from the computer or the parents not signing them up for any sport. It ruins their life by having no friends at school and all they do is go straight for the computer. It's a shame to the father that used to be the cool kid, make fun of the nerds and get into fights every month. Then the father looks at his son and realizes his son is a nerd and lives by a computer, then the father tries to help the son and somewhat works out. Then the father keeps trying, that's good parenting to try to step in right when the child starts to go straight to the computer. Not the other parents that let their son/daughter only use the computer. Those are my opinions on computers of the good and bad ideas, highlighting both their power and the responsibility required to use them properly.
828	830	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have a positive impact on people. Although people aren't outside being active, computers still benefit in a good way. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, they're convenient and you can interact online with different types of people. Surely, computers teach hand-eye coordination. There are many websites on the internet that teach kids to type. Typing helps kids learn the alphabet, learn what the letters look like and shows them where the keys are. Also, there are other sites where the computer interacts with you. Last, there are many kids even adults who have dyslexia and get their letters jumbled, but there are softwares where when you type it will say what letter you have typed. Therefore computers teach hand-eye coordination. Have you ever been one of those students who write their papers, but get bad grades because their handwriting was messy? Using a computer is more convenient and will make your due assignment as neat as ever. First, computers are convenient because you have the answer to any question just at the click of a button. Next, there's no need to spend money and go buy a book to look up research; just research online for free. Finally, it is convenient for teachers and your employees, because if you need to send in a paper do it via email. Getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with smudges. Computers are convenient in many ways. Computers allow people to video chat and talk online. First, there are many families who have at least one member who lives in a different place. Computers allow families to see each other online without ever leaving their state. Next, there are other families who have a mom, dad, husband or wife in the army and haven't seen each other in person in years, but see each other online. Lastly, there are many students and teachers who teach and learn online. This is easy for most people who have busy lives. Therefore you can interact online. As you can see computers have a positive effect. They teach hand eye coordination, they supply online chat, and are very convenient. So next time you go to the library to research a book, stay at home and do the same online to experience these benefits for yourself.
829	831	1	3	I believe having computers in a household is a good idea. They can play games, learn, talk and many more. Here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing. Having a computer is great to play games! There are so many varieties to choose from. There are card games, board games, even @NUM1 games! You can play solo, but it might be more fun and easier to bring some friends along for the ride. As you can see having a computer can be fun, but its not the only thing to do on a computer. Using a computer to learn is wonderful too. The computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. You can learn that in one place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. Animals have been here way before us. There is still much we don't know about them. Many scientists have spent their lives studying animals and have put it on the internet for you to better educate yourself. The computer can also teach you hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye is great to have if you're trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch something. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good; using voice chat or instant messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same interests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as they're online. Also while you're talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Sometimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous. As you can see games, learning and talking are easier to do on the computer. This is why I think computers are a valuable and positive addition to any home.
830	832	1	3	Dear editor, computers are good for people because they really help with their work and homework and other stuff. For instance, at work, computers allow employees to create documents, manage complex data, and communicate with colleagues across the globe efficiently, boosting productivity. For students, computers provide access to a vast amount of information for research and offer tools like word processors to complete homework assignments that are neat and professional. Beyond these primary functions, computers assist with other daily tasks such as managing finances through spreadsheets, staying connected with family through video calls, and even pursuing hobbies like digital art or music production. The convenience and power they bring to organizing our tasks and accessing information make them an indispensable tool in modern life, ultimately saving time and enhancing our capabilities in nearly everything we do.
831	833	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Are you spending all your precious time on a computer? On the computer you are probably wasting every second searching the web or playing games. You shouldn't spend a lot of time on the computer as it will just wash away your brain. You shouldn't go on computers for a long time because instead you should be exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with people. First of all, spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising. On computers you can't jog away the fat you gain by eating food. By jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world rather than the world behind the computer screen. Nevertheless, computers are fun to go on, like playing addicting games, but isn't it better to play a real sport like soccer? In soccer you have to use your mind and a lot of your body, so it is much better than sitting or laying around dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time. Don't you love playing outdoor games! Like playing tag or hide and go seek, isn't that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen? For me, I think it is. That is my reason why I think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen. Secondly, you shouldn't be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful and refreshing, unlike a computer. Yeah, I know computers offer a lot, but do they offer the fresh air outside, the warm breeze, the land, and the living animals on the earth? I don't think so and neither should you. Instead of going on your computer when it is raining, you should play with your pets, and if you don't have any, put on a raincoat or grab an umbrella and go outside. Especially in the summer you should be outside enjoying nature; go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park. There is more to offer outside than going on the computer. More importantly, you shouldn't go on the computer because you are better off interacting with living people in person. On the computer talking to people you are going nowhere; chatting with people on the computer makes it impossible to read someone's expression. So get off the computer and hang with your family and friends. Get into a fun conversation or debate. Make new friends when you're at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you. Get yourself out in the world; don't just interact with people but with the world, not the computer screen. In conclusion, you shouldn't spend most of your precious time on the computer. It isn't necessary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with people. I strongly believe people should be outside rather than on a computer. So what are you waiting for? Get off that computer and take a hike!
832	834	1	3	Dear Editor of the Local Newspaper, The average teenager spends nine hours on a computer daily! People spend too much time on their computers. They don't exercise as much nowadays. Also, they don't enjoy all the wonderful nature the world has to offer. Most importantly, people who spend too much time on the computer don't see their family and friends. These are the reasons why people shouldn't spend so much of their time on a computer. Since people spend too much time on the computer, they exercise less and less. A recent poll shows that one in every three children is overweight. If our modern society didn't have so many distractions like computers, then maybe people would be bored and maybe go outside. Back in the 1970s only fifteen percent of the adult population was obese. So, why in recent years has this number skyrocketed to thirty-five percent? Back then electronics weren't popular, so for fun, kids played games with each other outside on a regular basis. Now it's rare for a kid to be motivated to put down the mouse and go play kickball with neighborhood friends. The kids would rather sit inside an air-conditioned house than go outside and have some good healthy fun and work up a sweat. Computers keep people from exercising, so their effect on people is negative. With computers being so popular, people are less involved with nature. Our society doesn't take the time to notice the cool breeze on an autumn morning, or the waves crashing on a hot summer afternoon. They don't take time to appreciate how beautiful the foliage is in the fall, or how it feels to be showered with snow on a chilly winter morning. People would rather sit at a computer for several hours doing virtual wonders of our world. People don't respect the natural beauties that nature has to offer. Computers take away from people enjoying nature's joy. Computers ruin people's relationships with family and friends. A sixteen-year-old boy would rather talk to his girlfriend on the computer than spend time with his family. Kids don't organize their priorities well enough as it is; adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse. People have accounts on social networking sites like Facebook, and sometimes they are very drama-filled and cause problems. Friendships are easily ruined, and usually the cause of this is some kind of misunderstanding. It is very sad but true that kids would rather watch goofy videos than visit a grandparent. Computers are negative to people since they ruin their relationships with friends and family. People should spend less time on the computer. Computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates. Kids need to regain healthiness before it's too late! Also, people of all ages should realize the natural beauty of nature, but computers get in the way of that. Most importantly, computers ruin many relationships with friends and family. They cause stress and unnecessary drama. As you can see, computers have a negative effect on people.
833	835	1	3	When you were a kid, did your parents let you play all day on the computer? Well, my parents don't let me, and I think that's not fair. I think it's not fair because being on the computer has a lot of benefits, like teaching you hand-eye coordination. Another advantage is that when you're on the computer you can chat with people through webcams. Also, with a computer you can do homework assignments for something that requires you to do research. And of course when you're on a computer, you can watch your favorite movie or TV show, like popular sitcoms or exciting dramas. Now aren't these some great advantages? As an adult, I'm pretty sure that you like to do a lot of things from the comfort of your own home; well, when you have a computer you can. One way you can keep in touch is by online chatting, like through a webcam or my favorite, instant messaging. Surprisingly, another thing you can do is work online by setting it up at work or telling your boss how to do it. By the way, if you're an adult who didn't go to college when you were younger because you had to work, well, if you have a computer or laptop you can go to school online, and the best thing is that you'll be in your bed nice and warm without any worries. Now don't you think that is a nice way to spend your free time? When you're a kid my age and you have a computer, all you want to do is play games online with friends. Well, that is what most of us kids do nowadays, but our parents don't let us play too much. The only time they let us stay on long is when we are maybe doing a project for school. But when you're a kid, besides playing games all day, we also want to learn about things like historical places or famous landmarks; that's what you can do. Most people would agree that when you have a computer you can just book a hotel online instead of going all the way to the hotel. Of course, that's what my parents do; every time for a vacation they look everything up online, like the hotel and the flights. Yes, having a computer is helpful. Another thing you can do is watch movies online when you are on a plane going to the vacation, because that's what I do with my laptop. But the thing I like the most is watching shows because every time I watch different episodes of my favorite series the time goes by so quick that a three-hour flight only seems like one hour. Finally, I have explained to you why having a computer is a good thing. One reason is because you can do a lot of things on the computer itself. A second reason is that you can do a lot of school work with it, like doing a research paper or going to school online. And my final reason was that you can book things online without going anywhere, wasting gas. So now it's your turn to decide whether having a computer is a good thing or a bad thing.
834	836	1	3	Dear local newspaper editor, I think that kids should be allowed to go on their computers so they can talk to their relatives across the country whenever they want to. I have family members in another state. I talk to them every day because I have a laptop, and they say that I have relatives in a different city. I believe them because I have their email. They told me about my mother living in a nearby town. So I asked her, she said yes that is true, and I looked up where my mom lived. Thanks to the computer, I also learned that this city has one of the tallest mountains in the country. So I asked my mom if I can go to this city, and she said yes. So I went with my sister, and we even visited our family members and the mountain point; I can tell you it looked exactly how I pictured: very tall, covered with trees. Birds chirping, squirrels climbing trees; the thing that surprised me the most was there was a house on top of the mountain for sale. I wished that my mom was there because she will love it. So every time we go down there we rent that house, thanks to the computers. Lastly, you can even look up people on the internet. I heard that a famous comedian almost died. So when I got home I went on my laptop and looked it up, and it said nothing about that, but it did say one thing that surprised me the most: it said that he was getting a divorce from his wife. I think the person who said that he almost died must have misread it. So now I look up all my favorite people. Thanks to computers, the time is now to accept that people should have computers to use to learn about the world or just to see what everyone says. So I hope you make a good choice. But before you choose, think about it.
835	837	1	3	Dear readers of the local newspaper, the big rectangular shaped black or white box with lights and beeps, the computer was a smart idea! But why do you ask? I'll show you. This device can teach you a new language; Skype can let you talk to friends on the web or on the phone (but you still have to pay a small fee). You can surf the web or have a laugh on YouTube. Who needs to go out and buy stuff when on eBay or Amazon you can just order and you're done (but you still have to wait for delivery). Why go to a video store to rent movies when you can go on Netflix and order a movie and keep it for as long as you like? No late fees, no driving all the way to the movie store, no more of that please! Next, let's go back to the web. If you own a webcam or a built-in camera on your laptop or netbook, you can video chat with friends and family across the globe! If you're the kind of person that likes video games, then boy, you will love this! Personal computers can download games such as The Sims, Spore, etc., so then you will love the PC. MACs also share good stuff such as the Finder, Safari, Dashboard, etc., so that's all I have to say about Macintosh. And now you are probably asking which computer should I get? My dear friends at the newspaper, you have the ability to choose either a Mac or a PC, but it's not my decision to pick out your computer; it's yours, so go out and create an investment for a computer today! But I'm not finished yet; you can also pick a laptop, a desktop, or a netbook. I can tell you about all of them, and I will. A laptop is good if you're on the go a lot and if you're in the office or you have a lot of business trips; it's a good idea to have a laptop at hand. A desktop is good if you're home a lot and work is online on the web or you just like the comfort of home; then a desktop is right for you! And last but not least, the netbook; it's good if you're on the go a lot, especially when you're on vacation, and it fits nicely on your lap or on a table, or if you don't want to get up to use the computer just grab your netbook and you're ready to go. I almost forgot; all netbooks come with a built-in webcam, so if you're on vacation and you don't have a phone or computer, just go on your netbook and there you go. Well, that's all I have to say; thanks for reading.
836	838	1	3	Dear Newspaper writers, I believe that different web sites have different effects on people. For example, a pull news service like @ORGANIZATION1 has news about what is going on in the world, which keeps people informed. Other websites host all different types of games, which could be bad for some people because some of the games are not very appropriate for younger audiences. Most educational web sites are meant to help people learn, offering lessons on various subjects. One person can learn so much with a computer, from new languages to complex scientific concepts. You can buy and sell an item that you own and get many things all on one web site, which is very convenient. A computer can be used for many different purposes, making it a versatile tool in modern life.
837	839	1	3	Computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made. Not only are computers fun but they're also very beneficial to society. First off, computers are a great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant-messaging, email, video-messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. Around @DATE1, computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands of websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everyday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using @ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer and we could see his face. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news and weather. A few weeks ago, the power was out in our home. It was around @DATE1, so my family had no way to check the news on television. Since the internet is available through our cable provider, we were able to look up the local forecast on our computer. School was indeed canceled, and we learned this through our computer, connecting us to the world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arrangements, computers help to make everyday chores a lot easier. When my cousin was in high school, she was assigned a @NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's a pain having to count every word and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decided to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finished her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while her friend finished in an @NUM4 and a half hours because she hand wrote it. Its clear that computers are easier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society.
838	840	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people. I agree, because being on the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and people, and allows people to talk to other people. By being on the computer it helps teach people hand-eye coordination. So the computer helps with hand-eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard. For example, when you use a computer you don't need to look at your hands while you use the mouse. That helps with hand-eye coordination, because you can see where your cursor is on the screen without looking down at your hand. Another example is the keyboard, because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them. Then soon you can type with speed and accuracy without looking. The computer also helps you to learn. When you go on the computer the main thing people use is the internet. On the internet people can find information about faraway places or people. So, because the computer has different links and websites, it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast. Without the computer everyone would have to go to a library, but what if they didn't have the right information? Then you would need to travel around everywhere to find a book. That's why a computer is handy. Also, the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away. One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join. So, if a relative or friend is farther away or even if they are down the street, with chat rooms it makes talking easier. Also, by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of losing them from never seeing or talking to them. That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect. So, with the examples of the computer helping teach hand-eye coordination, making obtaining information easier, and allowing communication with distant friends, it is clear that computers have a positive effect on people.
839	841	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Computers don't have to take exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family away from you. Your family can set time limits on the computer if they think you are spending too much time on it. If you have time limits then people will have a certain time they go on and off of the computer. For example, a child is on the computer for @NUM1 hours and you can't get them off; time limits will stop that. The child is on a game and if the time limits are on, when your time is done the computer logs off automatically. That way your child can't get back on till their next allotted time. The computer can do many things; you can play online games and chat with friends. Chatting will let you talk to friends over the computer and you won't need to call them on the phone. Online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with. For example, an online game can let you chat, make friends, and explore virtual worlds together. With proper management, computers can be a fun part of life without taking over it completely.
840	842	1	3	"@CAPS1. The computer is a wonderful thing! However the effects it has on people can be bad. Think of it this way, it has magnetic forces that pull people to it and keep them @CAPS3 for hours. These magnetic forces keep people from exercising, stops them from spending time with family and friends and most importantly if they aren't being careful they can get into some cyber danger. I spoke with the @CAPS2 of @PERSON2 and he said, ""@CAPS3 are so many people on their computers, people aren't getting enough exercise!"" @CAPS4 people don't get enough exercise their bodies expand and become obese. This happens a lot to average people. The @CAPS2 and I thought up some great ideas while I was @CAPS3 and we think for one week in @DATE1 we are going to live without any electricity! Computers are very use-full, they help spread important information around fast and make it easy to talk to friends and family. Even though you are talking to them you are not learning any new social skills. Typing on the computer is a lot different from talking in person. Usually you would type ""u"" instead of ""you"" or ""r"" instead of ""are"". ""Talking over the computer is great!"" says @PERSON1, ""But actually seeing my family and talking to them is way better."" @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, and way more sights and websites can put you in cyber danger! Cyber danger is @CAPS4 you get in trouble on the computer. This can happen @CAPS4 you put up bad pictures of yourself or other people, @CAPS4 you talk to someone you have never met before, or you say something really mean to that girl you don't like. Those situations can all put you in a really tough place. Even if you have a webpage and you put it on private @CAPS3 is always a way to get in. @CAPS3 is also something called cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is @CAPS4 you get bullied or are bullying another person over the computer. Don't think that no one will know @CAPS3 are ways to track down conversations between people. I really hope you all take this into account @CAPS4 you think about sitting at your computer! Go outside, spend time with your family and friends, and be careful from cyber danger! ""@NUM1"" bye!"
841	843	1	3	A lot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. But I think that computers are extremely helpful because they are a good way to learn, they are fun to use, and it's also a good way to talk to old friends. I know there are some people who are on computers a lot more than they should be, but still computers are very helpful. Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out who the @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 is. But if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right book and find where in the book the information is located. You could also learn about news faster without waiting for it to come on the news channel. Computers are a lot better than having to drive to a library because with just a couple of clicks you could find what you want and be done. Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up an extra @NUM1 minutes that you might have on a work break or before school. And even some games exercise your mind like solitaire; it's fun but hard. But there are some games that people tend to overdo because they get addicted. But most people haven't ever played a game like that or only play once in a while. Lastly, computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online. For example, if when you were in high school your best friend moved away, you could still talk to people in a chat room where you can text, or on a video chat where you actually see them face to face. In conclusion, I think computers are helpful because you can learn, play, and talk to people. Computers are best all around helpful.
842	844	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 local @CAPS2, I think that computers are a positive effect on people. @CAPS6 you think that they are positive for people? Well I'll give you @NUM1 reasons why you should say ""@CAPS8"". They teach hand-eye coordination, provide the ability to learn and get your @CAPS3 online, and you can talk to people all over the world. These are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons. @CAPS1 first reason is hand-eye coordination. If you have good hand-eye coordination, you can @CAPS6 anything. This can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like. Having hand-eye coordination is important because in @DATE1 everything goes around by computer and cell phones. This is @CAPS1 first reason. @CAPS1 second reason is how the computer can teach people things. The internet has a lot of web sites about how to get your @CAPS3 online. And you can take online classes. There is a @PERCENT1 drop-out rate and @PERCENT2 of those kids don't have their @CAPS3, so they go online to take their classes. The computer can really help you learn new skills. This is @CAPS1 second reason. Finally, people go online to chat rooms to talk and meet new people. Meeting new people is a good thing to @CAPS6. You can learn about where and how the person lives. Chat rooms are cool too. You can go online and talk to your friends without wasting your phone minutes. The computer can help in many ways. @CAPS1 last reason. OK, I'm done but @CAPS6 you remember that question I asked you? (@CAPS6 you think computers are a positive effect on people?) @CAPS7 @CAPS6 you think? I hope you say ""@CAPS8, they are a positive effect"". But anyways those are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons why. P.S. I hope you go out and buy a computer after reading this!!"
843	845	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 everybody realizes, technology is getting more advanced every single day. That is a good thing and could help people with everyday problems like @CAPS19, getting an answer to a problem, and @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 work. The more advanced computers become, the more advanced people are. To start, computers can help people communicate; just imagine someone on the other side of the world. You can use websites like @CAPS3 and e-mail to quickly communicate through typing. I @CAPS4 like @ORGANIZATION2 can quickly send live videos of yourself all the way across the world. Without these technologies, we would never see each others faces and we would only be using telephones. With @CAPS5 book, you can also @CAPS6 @CAPS7 like never before. Have you ever been in the situation when you can't @CAPS15 @CAPS6 @CAPS7? Well I have; @CAPS7 can be easily uploaded in a matter of minutes. It used to be that @CAPS10 traveled very slowly, @CAPS8, we can know about it only a few minutes after it happened, thanks to computers. Computers can relay information at practically the speed of light. It is also a lot easier to find the @CAPS10. You only need to @CAPS9 the mouse a few @CAPS18 and you find the biggest reservoir of @CAPS10 ever. There is international @CAPS10, @CAPS11 @CAPS10, and much more in the palm of your hand. @CAPS10 also travels @CAPS12 on the internet then on @CAPS10 @CAPS14 or @CAPS15.V. There are also online @CAPS10 @CAPS14 like the @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18 and magazines like Time. Have you ever felt sick, and you didn't @CAPS15 want to leave your house? Well now you can do all your @CAPS19 online. There is no more going to a store to buy furniture or clothes; you can just log on to a computer and have almost every store at your finger tips. Buy a whole @CAPS16 @CAPS20, a @CAPS16 couch, and even your groceries in only ten minutes. You can even shop for houses or cars online. @CAPS19 on the internet has truly changed the world in more ways than anyone could have believed fifteen years ago. To @CAPS21, computers have made life easier for almost every person who has one. @CAPS1 computers get smarter, maybe they can also do incredible things like work for us and automatically buy something for us if we are running out of @CAPS22. The @CAPS23 are endless.
844	846	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have heard about this issue concerning people being on their computer too much. In my opinion, I think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons. There are reasons why I think that people should spend less time on the internet, and more time outdoors. One reason why I think that people should spend less time on the computer and more time outdoors is so that they can get more exercise. When you get exercise you can lose weight. You can also feel lighter and better about yourself, and you will be more active. Another reason why you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer is because if you don't you will get very very very lazy. If you don't get out and play or exercise, you will become tired. Also, you will become cranky and not want to do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so into your computer screen. My last but not least reason why we should spend more time outdoors than indoors on the computer is because we can miss out on family fun that goes on. Since people are on the computer so much they miss out on parties and social events. They @MONTH1 also miss out on family dinners and movie night. If you do not want to miss out on the fun, I suggest that you get outside more and stop being a lazy couch potato. As you can see, there are many reasons why we should spend more time outdoors doing activities such as going on a bike ride, going out to eat, or even a nice stroll along the heart while walking the dog. I really hope that my opinions mean something to you. And I also hope you agree with me. Thank you for your time.
845	847	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, ""@CAPS1 not advance in technology?"" asks four year old @PERSON2. There are countless reasons, people are spending way too much time on the technology we have already such as the computer. @CAPS9 of wasting time on this device, people aren't exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with their friends and family. When you are on the computer for one hour, how many calories do you think you're burning? According to a study done at @ORGANIZATION2, one of the best colleges in the world, you're only burning @NUM1 calories. To maintain a healthy weight, you must burn at least @NUM1,000 calories a day! The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends @NUM3 hours on the computer so that's @NUM4 calories. Even if they did aerobic exercise for the rest of the day, they couldn't burn enough calories @CAPS9 you can only burn @NUM5 calories an hour at the average aerobics class. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they become obese, if they are obese they can get heart attacks, and if they have a heart attack, they could die! @PERCENT2 of the obese population in the @LOCATION4 die from a heart attack. Without a doubt, computers are like poison; if you use it, you'll get sick - but if you use too much, you'll die. Imagine - birds chirping up in the trees, deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond. In the distance, a fox playfully chases a butterfly. If you are in @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 who have actually seen something like this with your own eyes you're lucky. ""@CAPS3 fellow @CAPS2, I painfully state this fact. The rainforest in @LOCATION3 is being cut down as we speak. This is @CAPS9 the @CAPS5 never go out and smell fresh air & see how beautiful the rainforest really is. We must stop them!"" pleads former @CAPS6 @PERSON3 in an internationally televised speech. Too bad only @NUM6 out of every @NUM7 @CAPS2 could relate to his message. @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 have never gone out into nature. @CAPS9 of this, people are saying who cares about nature & the rain forest? ""@CAPS9 of this, the rainforest is mercilessly being destroyed and animals are losing their homes. When a poll was given to the @PERCENT3 of people who don't ever go outside to enjoy nature @PERCENT1 of them responded that it was @CAPS9 they are too busy spending time on the computer. The computer is a monster - it's killing our planet."" ""I love @CAPS3 mommy. I @CAPS10 her everyday before dinner,"" sadly states eight year old, @PERSON1. Using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones, even if you are communicating with them on the computer. A @NUM5 year old cancer patient, @ORGANIZATION3 was on his death bed when asked what he wished that he could change about his life, he answered, ""I wish that I didn't use the computers as much so I got to know @CAPS3 family & friends better!"" @ORGANIZATION3 died later that day. Do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death? No, you don't. In a drug rehab the @ORGANIZATION4 asked the patients @CAPS1 they started drugs in the first place, @PERCENT4 answered that it was @CAPS9 they didn't feel loved by their families. After they answered, they were asked @CAPS1 they didn't feel love, @PERCENT5 of them answered @CAPS9 the people that they love were too busy on the computers. Unless you want to put one of your love ones in the hospital do not use the computers. Obviously, computers are awful technological devices. Yes, they do help with coordination, but would you rather be fast, not enjoy family & nature, but be able to catch a ball or be healthy, loved, and loving?"
846	848	1	3	Computers are very helpful in many of ways. I believe that computers can have a very great and needed effect on you. The internet can cause you to learn, research and find cheap products. The computer can teach you in many interesting ways. The fast way the internet can help is by helping other people plan their vacations by saving money for them. Also the internet can help by knowing how to do different things like providing maps if you get lost or showing you how to get there. The second way it helps is to give information. The computer can give you plenty of information. I use the computer for information purposes. The internet also gives me information about a specific college that I would want and like to attend. The last way the computer helps out is with shopping from home. If you shop online you can find great deals. I like this machine because you don't have to buy something that just came out at the real expensive price; you can just shop online and find it for a cheaper price. Also my mom wanted to find new tires at the dealer but they were expensive so we went online and bought them cheaper than the dealer would sell them to us. This is how the computer can come in handy when you need something. This is why I believe that computers are very useful for you.
847	849	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I do think that computers benefit society, because if a student needs to write a report for Europe, they are going to need a computer to give them quick and accessible information to do their project at home. Computers are great ways to meet people online so that you stay social and connected. They also teach hand-eye coordination, so your eyes are better at seeing and tracking. I also think computer benefits society because it could get students motivated in passing their tests or passing the school year and getting them to use it for learning. Computers are also a great source of knowledge and can get kids to be better on a subject like history, or science. You should agree with me because local newspapers get their information off the internet sometimes, and without our computers, news would be slow and hard to find. Computers also have positive effects on people because it teaches them the dangers of things and they could be more aware. Computers give finger a strong grip to be a lot faster at typing, and computers are the fastest way to know about the news or about the weather, like if there is going to be a snow storm you could check if you have school.
848	850	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings? The impacts? The results? The education? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to talk with others online, have the ability to educate in certain areas, and teach hand-eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, enjoyable way. Have a question that you have to ask a friend, but someone else is using the phone? Write a letter! Oh wait, letters can take up days and your question is urgent! The computer is an easy alternative for communication. Say you're an amazing singer with a beautiful voice and you want to find an agent more than anything. Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time. E-mail, websites, social media, and more, are all ways you can contact that agent. Computers are a great way to communicate. The mind is an extraordinary thing. It can be filled with knowledge, and still have the ability to learn and understand more. Reading books is a fantastic way to learn, but the internet has so much more to offer and you are not only reading from one great author, but tons of great authors. The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on television all the time. Some people sometimes think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intimidated by anyone else around you? Computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand-eye coordination is an excellent and wonderful thing to have. Along with videogames, computer games teach you exactly that. Parents sometimes think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer, but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand-eye coordination ability. Computers are key when it comes to psychological learning. Hand-eye coordination is taught to us through games and such that we play without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us achieve that skill.
849	851	1	3	"Recent studies have been conducted over the past few years, and they show that people of all ages spend a large percentage of their free time on the computers. This is becoming a problem all over our state and country. Computers are consuming the lives of everyone. An anonymous source claims that they use their computer to contact old friends. A study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend. This results in sitting in front of a computer screen waiting for a response. A student at the local school says, ""I go on the computer once or twice a week. I don't use it all that much because I'd rather be out having fun with all my friends rather than be holed up in a room by myself."" Some people believe it is a way to be more social, but it really isn't. It's just sitting in front of a screen talking to people you may not even know too well. When you sit down in your computer chair and start e-mailing away, you aren't doing any physical exercise. The only movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom. Then they are right back in a chair, making minimal movements. A significant percentage of people who sit in front of a computer end up obese because they don't burn any calories. Since they don't release many endorphins, they aren't very happy. If they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise, they would be fit and happy. Often, teenagers feel more powerful when they are using a computer. They find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them. Teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks. A number of students at the local middle school confess to being the target of malicious bullying online. Others confess to be bullied, and they definitely don't want to be bullied on facebook or myspace where everything is out on your profile for your peers to see. Teens should have limited time on the computer, so they don't do anything they will regret in their future. Therefore, adults and teens should be aware that using a computer is fine, but they shouldn't over use the luxury of a way to find information quickly or contact a friend in a foreign country. This generation needs to be reminded that their whole life shouldn't be spent on the computer. Probably less than a certain number of minutes a day should be spent checking your e-mail or instant messaging a friend. Then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family for a healthier lifestyle."
850	852	1	3	With the recent development of technology in todays society I know that there is a lot of controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society. While others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world. But people experience less of the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. But I feel that we can find a balance between the two views. Having computers has brought a lot of advancement in todays society. Look at modern medicine, it would be nothing without todays technology in computers. We can look at todays military. Computers practically run todays armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help of computers. But then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. So, as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression. But with all of this technology we still need to find a balance. It is like todays kids spend many hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside of their computers. Our state does put in money each year for our parks just so we can ignore them. Also with increased computer time people are not getting outside. They aren't getting proper exercise. You may even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family. So although computers can be very useful you need to be able to turn off the computer and realize the true important things in your life, besides the computers. computers can be both good and bad. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. Computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers. Lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function. Entire companies revolve around computers and if computers just ended, many people would lose their jobs. But also regular people, for example teens, do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day. Those four hours could be spent with their families. We need to find a balance. For example, you could say for every hour your on the computer you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful but we cannot over use it. So, to the newspaper, computers help our society thrive. But at the same time we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer. So I believe that we can all find a healthy balance of computer use in our lives.
851	853	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are powerful machines in our world. Most people eat, sleep, and drink computers. That's when those people are forty and live with their mom, for the most part computers are used by teenagers and business workers. Computers are a tool that needs to be used in an everyday life. We all know and remember when we were ""sick"" just so we could go to the office with mom or dad to draw pictures and spin in the office chairs. Well while we were busy playing mom and dad were busy as well. They talked to their boss, made copies, had meetings, drank coffee, and most of all they spent half of the day doing work on the computer. It could have been making spreadsheets, designing logos, editing someone’s work, or getting new clients. About ninety percent of the workers use the computer to do their jobs. They need to be sending work to other companies overseas or just down one floor. Computers need to be used to do most jobs in our town. Also the computers in today's time are beautiful because they have the internet. The internet allows us to talk to people around the world and look things up like the news, the closest bridle shop, the biggest shopping mall, biggest race car track near you and pizza places near you. The internet can let you do many things. I know that here in Granby you have to buy the newspaper, but instead of buying the paper you can just go on your computer and check the news. Look up the weather, the celebrity gossip, and where the plane crashed that your mom told you about. The computer can give you great information but only if you know how to use it. One thing that I find great is that you can watch tv and movies right from your computer. Then you don't need to buy all those high priced channels to watch movies. You can see your favorite shows and movies. A big thing is that teenagers spend a majority of their time on Facebook, Twitter or Myspace. Some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family. You can let people know what you are doing or tell them you are sad because your dog died. You just can use the internet for just about anything. Lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers. You don't need to go out and spend a lot of money on an album, you can now just buy a single song for a dollar. You can buy many things on the internet like clothes and food. That's why the computer is such an essential and versatile tool in our modern lives."
852	854	1	3	My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer, the more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and can't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person is because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just to sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a human's life. The computer technology has control over a huge population of the race. It really makes people miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basically they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out of hand because the computer allows people to order food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting exercise, and being lazy. You need to get your exercise daily. So people that don't get their exercise need to start, instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over the whole world have a lot of loved ones that they care about and love. But they don't get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from your outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk to your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said in person. I guarantee you that. If you spend time with your family then you will want to do it again. While you're going out you can exercise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are always on the computer that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and exercise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazier. If you're always on the computer just be sure that you get your exercise and your time with your family. It will make you a better person and improve your overall well-being.
853	855	1	3	Dear School Newspaper, Computers have both negative and positive effects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good effects that computers have on people, the negative effects outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this century are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as a necessity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be dependent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they can't get viruses and strangers can't look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting without exercise and aren't necessary for a fulfilling and active life.
854	856	1	3	When you are using technology usually it is work related. A computer is used for work to write essays, make power points, and research, when people use them for Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, and other chat live like Oovoo and websites it is more for their pleasure. I only go on Facebook when I am checking my schedule for hockey, most kids use it for talk. Then there is Oovoo, an online video chat used for talking with friends but why not just call them up. When I think of Facebook or Oovoo, or even Myspace it makes me think of inappropriate pictures kids, and adults post. I think that is very inhumane and that is very dangerous to post it because once it's out there you'll never get it back. For instance I am always outside hanging around when it's warm out, during winter I can understand going on Facebook, but during the summer there is no need just go outside and have fun. Kids wonder why they gain weight, well if you'd get off your computer, and quit eating twinkies then you'll notice you just have to be active. Some kids parents don't really give a flying faldoodle what their kids do all day. They don't care if their kid is overweight at a young age. They don't care if their kids are sitting on the computer eating all-day. If I could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato I would but I never go on the computer unless it is for homework. I used the computer just last night, I typed up all of my homework except for my math. I didn't play one game, I didn't check email go on the internet or anything I just worked my hardest and got it done. I conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing, using it repeatedly and not exercising is. A computer shouldn't need to be used for pleasure it's not created to do so it's created to keep your life simpler. People pay money to buy an expensive computer and modem and all that expensive technological accessories, to make their lives much simpler not anywhere in this essay did I say to play games because it's not. Playing games can be done outside, it doesn't have to be inside, and definitely doesn't have to be on a computer. To make everyone's life easier kids, get off your lazy butts, get off the twinkies, and stop playing on the computer for endless hours.
855	857	1	3	Dear School District Newspaper, Have you ever wanted to see your cousin that lives across the country? Well computers can do that. They are positive in effecting people in more ways, such as letting people communicate with family or friends from across the world or letting everything be easy to find what they need. While many people think computers isolate people and keep them from talking to family and friends, it is actually helping them by being able to chat or type to them. People can now talk to relatives in the comfort of their home without having to worry about how they look. Computers also save on phone bills because instead of calling your mom in another state you can just go on a chat service and chat with her, it's just easier and you can see her. Some people also think computers give people too much access to information, but the truth is it gives people the ability to know what they are looking for. This is good for school projects to look for information and resources. In my own experience, or for people doing research, you can see computers let you find the information you need quickly. The time has shown that computers help with communication and information without necessarily keeping people away from their family and friends when used responsibly.
856	858	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I believe that we should tell the people of @LOCATION1 about the dangers of using computers too much. For example, people who use the computer constantly spend less time doing anything else in general, such as engaging in physical activities or socializing face-to-face. Also, the longer you stay on the computer, the more you use it, and this habit forms a powerful addiction, which might be very hard to break. Finally, people who always play video games on computers can begin to lose their grip on reality, confusing fantasy with the real world. Computers are turning this nation into a bunch of mindless sloths. If you have children, what do you think they do most of their lives? Maybe they're going outside and getting exercise, or their brains could be getting sucked into a computer screen. Most kids by the age of @NUM1 have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hour. This shows that kids spend more time using the computer than on anything else. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3 hours a day and eventually he was so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you don't want your kids to be like @CAPS1, tell them to get up and go play outside. You probably think that using your computer everyday couldn't form an addiction, but computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientists have found that using the computer everyday for one hour can be enough to form a strong addiction. In fact, if we could scan people to find addiction, @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This means that @NUM4 years from now the world addiction to computers could be at @PERCENT2 or greater. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone uses their computers @NUM3 hours a day? I don't. Video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest. If you have a computer you will likely have video games. Small dosages can be fine, but non-stop playing can lead to serious problems. Because of the fantasy content, people might start to lose sight of reality. For example, scientists tested a video game on kids, and now @PERCENT1 of them believe in zombies. Now they cannot ever play the game again for it might cause serious brain damage. Just to make sure you get my point, let us recap. More computer time means a lack of exercise and social interaction, you can easily become addicted, and you can lose your sense of realness. I believe that you don't want to see you or your kids' brilliant brains turned to mush by computers.
857	859	1	3	The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inability to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships, for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an intense internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind and body. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind @MONTH1 be racing but the body sits unmoving, @CAPS1 physical activity is being done. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed, or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later and later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same; you cannot feel the breeze or smell the fresh air. Also, computers are indoors, so the true world is shielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops, if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to only pretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?
858	860	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Students come home from school tired, bored, and don't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat with their friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat with their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat with friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music while doing homework rather than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want to visit; other students might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, France, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about these places before they ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but not all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer.
859	861	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I know the debate on whether computers benefit society is greatly debated, but to me the answer is obvious. The internet is an extremely useful invention, used in all schools and is only inconvenient when misused. I'm not saying that its @PERCENT1 necessary for every house to contain one, but that its a luxury most people have. The computer and internet combination is probably one of the most genius ideas ever thought up. It is basically any information in a click. Websites such as Myspace and Facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new. Also the ability to create your own web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a business or company. Not only that, but the internet also makes it possible to purchase clothes online without having to go to the store. I know that's useful for those parents, like many, that hate driving to the mall. Second, I can guarantee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessible internet. The computer was just one huge leap forward for education. There are many websites with an educational purpose only. These are websites like this for children and adults of any age. Many teachers nowadays are assigning homework where the internet is necessary. Also tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online. I can tell you right now that many teachers would be torn apart without the computer. Lastly, one of the most important issues is the downsides of the internet. Even though Myspace and Facebook are meant for good they also have a dark side, such as privacy concerns and online predators.
860	862	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immediately go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much. I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extraordinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on Facebook; Facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination. When projects come along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it won't look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on T.V. and otherwise, like YouTube or Google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that I will never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlet to come home and let yourself unwind. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view and understand the value computers provide.
861	863	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day society and how we are connected to them. So I believe that these atrocious things should very well be disposed of. There are good reasons for thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an environmental breakdown we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if you're talking about actual talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to mention the fact that the environment is already falling apart. The way nature's heading we will all end up dying no thanks to computers. First how harmful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In America there's only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reproduce more will be gone forever due to expansion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staying inside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because there's a hypno disk in all computers making us stay close suffocating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagine all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minutes I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and none knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for hours on a time you would think that they're alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do illegal things on the internet like download music which they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an interaction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satisfied sexual offenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. That's a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with lawyers who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who don't have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunately those @PERCENT1 persistent without computers are likely to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a deadly poison that the computer delivers to your brain. In conclusion this world can be one of the more angerest. So come together get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those virtual meetings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attack the robots back. People should go for a run cut off some of the obesity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room. Get outside go for a road trip save life humanity your fellow neighbor your family.
862	864	1	3	"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. This issue is debatable but really I think that computers are not helping the big picture. I don't think that they benefit our health or social actions because computers keep us inside when we could be out. Everyday when I come home from school, I find myself going straight inside and to the computer from there, I log into @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. And my exercise in the next @NUM1 hours or so is only in my fingers. My point is that there is a whole world outside if we only got off our computers and played outside. Statistics show that @NUM2 kids spend more time inside year-round than out these days. ""@CAPS1 is ridiculous how much things have changed in just @NUM3 years."" says @PERSON1 a pediatrician in @LOCATION1, ""they all need their exercise."" @CAPS1 is outrageous how much people are on computers now, @CAPS1 starts to affect their attitude, and control their lives. Sometimes checking notifications on @CAPS3 can be more important to someone than spending time with their family or friends. A mom of @NUM4 teens says ""They all go to their rooms, shut their doors and go on @CAPS3 and @CAPS6 until dinner and after, they go right back."" In this case, they just plug into their computers and forget about everyone else. I think @CAPS1 has gotten out of hand how much people and teens especially are addicted to computers. One in @NUM4 moms says she sees her kid growing apart from the family because of a computer. You @MONTH1 say that when on your computer there is a person you are talking to, and while pen-pals are great, you should really go out and do something! You are talking to your friends, but its not the same as being with them. On my recent trip to @LOCATION2 to go skiing, I found that some of my friends jokes funnier when you're with her and not just sitting on a computer. We had a blast! Now I regret not getting together with her to hang out. Also @NUM6 arguments now, have something to do with a misunderstanding through the computer, people @MONTH1 get the wrong message when you send something to them or they take @CAPS1 the wrong way. The truth is, computers are starting to take negative effect on our society and even ruin relationships. If we just get off our computers and get out, we can turn that around and improve our lives."
863	865	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have. My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and become obese. You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my story. First of all if you're always on the computer you're not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. Also you're going to have to eat and when you get excited you're going to want to eat more. Then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise and you just sit there for hours. Secondly, you would spend less time with your family. You would think that you're going to hang out with them later. So then you play more and get addicted to the screen. So then you and your family would grow apart over time. And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you won't have friends. I think you won't have friends because if you're on the computer all the time you won't even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone there. The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. That you will never meet in real life and won't socialize with them about their life and to hang out with them in person. In conclusion I think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spent less time with your family, and you won't have any friends to talk to. I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration before spending too much time online.
864	866	1	3	Dear, Local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are everything, They provide with so many things for you to do like chess, listening to music, and even downloading your favorite movies. First of all, computers are a great source of communication because if you have a long distance relative that lives in @LOCATION1 then you can talk to them online. You can do this through via email, instant message, and @CAPS1 which makes it feel like they are right there with you. Secondly, Computers let you search the web. So if you need to find out some directions to your destination or want to get information on some far away places like @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, or my favorite @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you can because the web lets you do that from your own home. Thirdly, they are a great source of entertainment. Well because you can watch episodes of your favorite @CAPS4.V. show or you can watch music videos on demand. Also you @MONTH1 enjoy listening to music from your computer as you personal entertainment system. I think that computers are great. I use them myself as an example I love to download music into my ipod from my computer. Then I get to enjoy the music from my ipod wherever I go. Last, but not least, @CAPS5 computers have a great effect on a majority of people and how they live their lives. I believe that if we didn'@CAPS4 have computers then our world wouldn'@CAPS4 be the same and we would lose so much convenience. So I say keep computers here to stay. They complete us all and make our daily tasks easier and more fun.
865	867	1	3	I think that computers have a bad effect on people. I think that because of many reasons and I will tell you some of these reasons. One reason would be not get exercise going on the computer all day, you will only get worse. Say if you were @NUM1 years old and when computers come out you bought one and went on it every day instead of being fit. Then if you have no exercise then you will get bigger and bigger and your health will decline. Another reason if you would only use computers for research I say this because there is no reason to go on your computer all day a good reason to go on the computer would be if you have some kind of project for school or a job instead of just using your computer for facebook or myspace which is a waste of time. Then there is some kind of disease that can happen to your if it does the same thing to many times like carpal tunnel syndrome. Your don't want to do that because if you don't use computer that much and you play some kind of sport like football, baseball, or any other kind of around some place you can avoid that. Also if kind of surgery on it and that will cause you from doing almost everything with that one hand which is a big problem. My last reason go on the computer your viruses connected to it. If you do that then maybe your computer will lost everything on it from a bad virus. Then you have to get a new computer and everything all over again. If you bought a new computer and you got somebody can hack your computer and get all of the information from it like your passwords. The information then they like how to use it against you. And if you don't know person you don't know what they can do with your private details. So I hope you don't buy something that has a really bad virus else like that which can ruin your computer. Those would be all reasons on why you shouldn't go on the computer to much and why it does not really help other then when you are doing research or any other kind of work or job related way that is necessary.
866	868	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, ore and more people use computers @DATE1, but this is not necessarily a good thing. Spendign too mcuh time on computers affects your activity level. Also. Kids are now staying up later on the compute, in turn lowering grades. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decrease the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time spent has on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising. For instance, @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study. Doctors have said that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most o ftheir time on the computer, thus limiting their time exercising. The amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. If we want to become a healthier country, we should state @CAPS5 writing time spent on computers. Also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades @CAPS5 doing so. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids in spent an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while kids spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours each day. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ just @CAPS5 spending less time on the computer and more time on their studies. That studnet also felt more because they get more computer. This tests and quizzes. Computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work. Finally, computers limit the amount of time spent with family nd friends. A student, @PERSON1, said that she, spent more time going out with friends now that computer isn't up all my time, @CAPS5 doing this, i have a better friendshhip with all my friends than before. ""A kid that uses the computer during all of the free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who usues it in moderation. Afmilies also suffer from this a swell. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together an dwill likely not know what is going on i their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does nnot benefit society. They affect a persons activity level, students grades and most importantly a persons realtionships with family and friends. In oredr to ake our country a better and healthier place, we must the time spent on computers and prioritize real-world interactions and physical health."
867	869	1	3	In my opinion computer ars benefit with the socient here are my s reasons, I can talk wit my friends, I can do my homework, or I can do olner things in the computer to. First reasons, I can talk with my friends or I can talk with my family on facebook or myspace o his on msn or I can se my family in the camera msn the camera is allot of help with me because lik my family is in @LOCATION1 I chat with them every @DATE1 instead of sending pictures and videos or going visiting to @LOCATION1, which saves a lot of time and money. Next reasons, I can do my homework on I can write a big letter on I can do a lot of work in the computer is and easy, allowing me to finish my assignments faster and more neatly. Final reason I can do a lot of things like find a question or do project on the internet, which helps me learn new things and complete my school projects efficiently. Therefore, computers are a great benefit to society because they help us communicate, learn, and accomplish tasks more easily.
868	870	1	3	Computers are a nice item to have but they are bad if you don't know how to control your time. Many people @CAPS3 days donít get enough exercise and the lack of healthy people is costing the @CAPS1 tax payers millions. Also, people aren't enjoying life as much as they would if they didn't use a computers all of the time and thier are many people who have completely cut themselves off frfom their families and friends. I am positive that when you are done reading this you will be, one hundred percent pursuaded that the effects computers have on people are bad. To begin with, many people spend to much time on a computer instead of being outside or execising. This effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy. Because so many are at an weight it is costing tax payers millions. For example, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 talking about healthcare, and anc easy sollution to cut the cost down is to have people exercise. More ofen in order to stay healthy. As technology to affect our lives, we used to remember that being healthy is more important than sitting on a computer all day. In addition to people not people dont enjoy life as much, You only live once and life is special, so why sitting all day? I many anymore because they spend all of there @CAPS3 are so many things to do in life that will bring you enjoyment than playing on the a computers. need to be and I can tell you that you life will not being you in enjoyable luife. Lastly, computers have made a lot of people when people got to Too many people a major view when it comes to family and friends. Although computers are an easy way to communicate to people, they should not be the anly thing you use to talk to friends and family. So as you can see, computers are causing us to lead on-healthy lives because our priorities on health are why to low. They also keep you from enjoying life, to the fullest and can separate you from friends and family when not controlled. I am positive that I have pursuaded you not to spend so much time on a computer. So next time you are using a computers, think of all the things you are missing out in life and make a change for the better.
869	871	1	3	"Dear, Newspaper In my mind the computer benifits us in many different ways. Computers are entertaining, computers help us with education, and the heath/safty purposes are fantastic. People love entertainment. Computers are very fun. At electronic stores computer games are sold. These games are usally good. Instead of having games that are bad for the brain most compuer games are not. My friend @PERSON2 bought a computer game last week. @CAPS4 says @CAPS3 is very entertaining but is not brain damaging. Everyone loves watching @CAPS1.V. On computers people can now watch @CAPS1.V. Not only is that entertaining but @CAPS3 will save money because you don'@CAPS1 need a @CAPS1.v. Now people can insteadly down load @CAPS1.v. shows and movies on thier computer. @PERSON1 just got a new computer for his birthday last week. ""@CAPS3 is so fun watching @CAPS1.v. on my computer and @CAPS3 is so easy."" @CAPS4 explained. Learning from @PERSON1 I hope you can learn how entertaning computers are. At school we use computers all the time. If we did not have computers we would not learn the same. On his new computer @PERSON1 can do all his projects and homework on @CAPS3. Before @CAPS4 had his computer @CAPS4 had to write out all his papers and when @CAPS4 finished @CAPS4 spent to long writing that @CAPS4 could not do his rest of homework. Now @CAPS4 can not type @CAPS3 out, and still do all his other homework. If you think that amazing then read this. Research done by @ORGANIZATION1 found out that @PERCENT1 of kids with computer are smarter than before they had thier computers. ""I was getting all @CAPS5's when I did not have my computer. Now I get honors on my report card because of my computer."" @PERSON1 says. I hope people can now be like @PERSON1 and buy computers. Do you want to have a smarter world? Computers open up an all news heath and safty field. You @MONTH1 learn a little about geneitics. @CAPS3 would have took about @NUM1 years longer to crack the code of the genes of we did not have computers. All the information scientists have learned from the human geno project can cure cancer and other dieseases. Computers are also safe to make sure your kids are safe. New technology can track kids. If an unfortunet event happens an your kid is missing then a computer can help to find him. A new mother lost her kid last @DATE1 while eating lunch at a park. She knew she had a chip in the childs body. She opened her laptop and found where her kid was. Amazing right. I hope everyone can have a computer for heath and safty reasons. I hope you can now see that computers benifit the society from heath and safty to education in school. Without computers we could not be where we are today, and they continue to improve our lives in countless ways."
870	872	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 The purpose of this letter is about how computers have changed our lives for the better. They have improved our society. Changed our way of life and have made things easier. I am a firm beliver that computer were one of the greatest invention of all time. Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society. For example, education has vastly expanded since the computer. Both teachers and students have benefited. Students can now search the intrenet and learn about different places, things in history, how to read and write bette, etc. Also computers have been a major part in entertainment. From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us. And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people. Aside from that computers make life easier. People can get degrees from learning online learn another language. Research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers. Some people say computers stop people acting with family but infact facebook you can still stay connected with them online. Computer have also improved ourlives. From helping small buiness thrive by making it easier to make and recieve orders to help spread information globaly computers make this all possible. As I have shown computers have benefited society and have had a positive effect on human beings from educating individuals to staying in touch with relitives, computers have made their mark on improving the way we live. I hope this letter will help show you that computers are a necesary part of the twenty first century and will continue to drive progress forward.
871	873	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that having a computer is a very positive thing. I know that teenagers are on the computer a lot, but if it really bothers the parents, why do they have computers in their houses? @CAPS3, I can tell you @NUM1 reasons why. They are good sources of information, it's a good way to talk with your friends and it gives you information about places that you might not know about. Primarily, I would like to say that computers are a fantastic source of information. They can tell you anything! This is also helpful because if you are working on a project, and your mom can't take you to get books at the library, then there you go! A computer is just a simpler way to look up information. Did you know, that @PERCENT1 of parents who got their family a computer do not regret their decision? That's almost all the parents in @LOCATION2! @CAPS6 as you can see, it would help kids with whatever they are studying. Secondly, we teenagers today use computers to talk with our friends through @ORGANIZATION1 email. @CAPS3, I think this is a lot better than sending @CAPS4! Why would you wait for a letter from your cousin in @LOCATION1 when you can talk to them in seconds! And it doesn't waste paper if you just @CAPS5 to buy it. I would like to say that having a computer helped my family one time; I was working with my parents and we were looking for a hotel to stay in when we went on vacation. We ended up finding a great hotel, for a cheap price online. You can also go on map quest if you @CAPS5 to find someone's house. @CAPS6 for all the people out there who don't think computers are important, I ask what would you do without one? In conclusion, I think that having a computer is a very important thing for @NUM1 reason: they are very good book sources, they help us communicate with friends and they provide information on everything. For @CAPS6, I'm leaving the opinion with you, hopefully you will learn something and make a better, right choice.
872	874	1	3	Almost every family has access to a computer. They have become a part of daily life and a way to be connected to the world outside of your house, even if you have to stay at home. Computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources. They have already caused exponential advancement in many fields. Overall, computers have a positive effect on society. On a rainy day, @NUM1 students will spend time on their computers. Out of those students, @PERCENT1 will be on sites such as A.I.M.(@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3), @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @ORGANIZATION2. Even if they can't use their phone or get out of the house, they can communicate with friends, old and new. Teens and adults use the @CAPS6 to talk to friends they haven't seen for up to @NUM2 years. People will talk to each other more, building more relationships and better conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites used by teens are based on @CAPS8 networking. To be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement. @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi-million dollar company. @PERSON1, a founder for @ORGANIZATION1, says that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have skyrocketed in popularity over the @DATE1. More and more people are putting down their @PERSON2 dictionary to type the word into @LOCATION1, where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily. Students use computers for information on school reports in @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. Information can be found in any subject. There was a survey taken to see which is used more often, books with a specific subject or computers for information on various subjects. Computers are used overwhelmingly more often. They're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a vast resource on the @CAPS6. And a site of particular interest or exceptionally useful can be added to your favorites. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have @NUM4 main component: computers. Ads from @ORGANIZATION3 show that their computers are getting smaller and smaller. There's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments so they're more legible. Computers can even score tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. But computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is faster than hand-writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. If our country keeps advancing at this rate, then it is possible to have computers that do mundane chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that talk back to you like a real conversation. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and think of progress. There are points about computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are beneficial to society. In a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources. Most of all, computers represent progress and advancement. I see no direct harm from computers.
873	875	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer benefits society due to the positive effect on people. Such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look up definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. You are probably wondering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1, I was working on a long history paper and a @CAPS1 essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock off I went to my basketball game, and the best game of my life was played. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; I missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that with consistent use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethnicities and religion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology. In history class, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through the knowledge of this hunger, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like myself do not eat for @NUM1 hours. Research has proven that @NUM2 children in countries of Africa die a day from malnourishment. Now that this has been brought to my attention, I am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what I consume. Thus through the use of computers I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it's my duty to help. Do you have family that's across the country that you are rarely able to see? My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3 and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we are only graced with their presence about once a year we begin to miss them. But now through skype, email and facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @LOCATION4 as well as the places they have recently traveled to. Also @PERCENT1 of the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spend at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I have moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 and staying in contact with my friends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth. The use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives. To conclude, due to improved hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online with other people the use of computers benefits society. Through the internet, people can learn about @LOCATION2 places to travel, bike and exercise while enjoying nature. Furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computers.
874	876	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I think you're wrong!! I totally disagree with this letter. People need computers to do research. It also helps us keep in contact with others. Another thing is @CAPS1 can get anything needed online. First, @CAPS1 need computers. @CAPS1 need computers to help us with research. Instead of picking up a book you can go online. It's faster and easier. Also, you can look up information on any place or any project and it will help you. That's the great thing about the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4; it has any information. Next, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 web is also used for keeping in contact. For example, instant messaging. Also you can chat on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. You can even go in a chat room. But just keep in mind to know who you're talking to because it might be a stranger. Anyways you can use the internet @CAPS7 as an easy way to talk to people or to ""keep in contact"". Lastly, @CAPS7 you know the internet is used for research and talking but also for getting anything you want. You can go online and get pictures, games, videos, music or even directions to a place. Also the internet is used to just have fun. I use it mostly for youtube, @CAPS5, and for googling pictures. You can look up basically any thing on line and it will most likely be there for you. In conclusion, the web is used for researching. Also for chatting. Finally for basically anything you want it for. That is why @CAPS1 should have internet because you can still go online but have fun outside too. But maybe people should cutback a little on @CAPS8.V. Now do you see why I chose this side? Maybe in the future there will be a way to go on the computer but be active too."
875	877	1	3	"Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and prove themselves to be invaluable because we use them everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our daily routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay in touch with a far away friend, learn about and experience faraway places, or to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so beneficial to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relative move; when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of a computer you can stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which allows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actually get an image of your friend or relative. Even Oprah Winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people ""skype"" on to her show. In addition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older. These relatively new ""social networking sites"" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when I wake up and watch sportscenter I always hear about what famous athletes are posting on their twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of dollars to go to a beach paradise in the tropics, but with the use of computers, you can go there virtually. Computers are great in this aspect because they allow you to learn and experience many expensive things for free. For example if you wanted to learn something about India, you wouldn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type it in. There are many websites such as this that give you access to information that you could ever need. This proves also to be valuable if you are studying for a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information without ever having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It allows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive a car. Many computer skeptics believe that you don't benefit from using computers but a recent study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than non-computer users. When driving you often need to operate the car, turn up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be a scenario where improved hand-eye coordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important skill and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are beneficial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in getting information on a topic. Computers are one the most significant inventions ever and are valuable in many many ways."
876	878	1	3	I think using the computer is great. You should heed my advice, as people should be using computers more often. Computers are an excellent way to communicate, allowing people to connect with others from all over the world. My dad moved to Brazil, so we have been communicating via email, Skype, and even Facebook. It’s the easiest and cheapest way to communicate. If I call someone from a different country it would cost me way more, but if I send them an email it’s significantly cheaper. Studies from the University of Cambridge show that eighty-five percent of people think it's easier to use a computer to communicate. Moreover, you can do it instantly, so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds. Computers are indeed the best way to communicate. Another thing computers are used for is learning. Many people from around the world have learned different languages from websites or programs that offer great instruction and lessons. I learned to play guitar with many programs and online lessons. Many people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. My mom is a secretary at an insurance broker company. Without computers, the customers couldn’t learn about the different policies that are available, and they might be spending more money than needed on insurance. Without computers, scientists couldn’t do much research or learn about plants or rocks. Computers make it easier for them to study and learn about the Amazon rainforest and everything. Doctors wouldn't be able to do half of the things they can without a computer. They learn about different sicknesses and broken bones by using computers. Dr. Evans said she couldn't be able to help out as many people without the use and help of a computer; she states that she learned seventy percent of what she knows from websites that have information about the human body. Even teachers say that they get better teaching skills from websites. Builder and modern designer John Miller says he learned about different building designs that are sturdier and stronger shapes; he used this in his building today. I hope that you can now see how great computers are and how much they help our present day citizens.
877	879	1	3	Dear Editor, do you think the computer is the best technology made so far? Computer! They are the best technology because you can do anything on the computer. My friends say computers are one of the best technologies because the internet can help a lot with things like if you have a research paper. Research has proven that computers are a positive effect on people. My mom says computers are one of the most hardiest tools in the world. Ninety percent of my friends say that computers are one of the best because you can get help from the internet on homework assignments. They say that it allows people to talk online with other people. They said that they can interact with family members who live far away. They also said that being on the computer has taken more teens off the streets and into their homes. Dr. Smith has done extensive research and has proven that being on the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. Another thing he has proven is that since computers have been invented the violence rate has gone down because more people spend time at home on their computers rather than out on the streets. He also proven that since people have started using computers for school, the success in school grades has gone way up. He thinks they have gone up because, instead of students reading long boring articles on someone or something, they can just search it on the internet. He said using the internet also saves more time. My mother says when she was younger the computer gave her the ability to learn about far away places. My mother said that the internet would also let you learn about people's customs rather than reading books because some books have not yet been upgraded and you would want to learn about their newest customs also. My mom thinks that using a computer is a positive effect on the world. Editor, you are doing a fine job at writing at your job. My friends say computers are helpful, research has proven that computers have dropped the percentage of violence down, my mom also thinks that the computer is a positive effect on us. I know you will agree with me when I say that having computers has put a powerful effect on people; it gives people an easier time in life.
878	880	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, ninety percent of the people would agree that computers are useful and by having them they help the ability to learn about far away places. They also allow people to talk to other people online. Lastly, computers are important to people that work with them. There are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society. Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places? Sometimes people don't know when they want to leave the country. With a computer you can organize it all. Some people, like my family, like to go visit their families in other places. For example, once my mom told me we were going on a trip to Mexico to go visit our family; she told me she already got the tickets on the computer. I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful Mexico is. Some people like to see new and beautiful places, such as Paris, Tokyo, and even Rome. Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online. Most people have Myspace and that allows kids my age to keep in touch. Also, Facebook allows you to find people that you probably haven't seen in a long time. For example, one time I was looking around Facebook and found my old best friend Sarah. I was so happy because when she moved I thought I would never talk to her again. I am one hundred percent positive that everyone in this world has a Yahoo account; you could find people really quick and talk to them. Would you believe that there are so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer? Such as scientists; they all have to have computers or else they wouldn't be able to invent all the great things they make. Also, secretaries have to assign dates for their bosses. For example, a secretary for a doctor has to be able to give and to change appointments. Lastly, students that go to school and most importantly college with no computers, they won't be able to do their homework. Most people would agree that computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons that they give the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to other people online. Computers are very important to people who work with them.
879	881	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, imagine being able to find the information of anything with only one hand. Computers benefit people because they can talk online with others. Also people have the advantage of learning about faraway places. Lastly you are able to find lots of information quickly and easily. Computers do benefit society. Furthermore, with computers people can talk online with others easily. All of the students use the computer daily to video chat with friends or instant message parents! A recent study discovered that computers keep families closer because they are able to see each other virtually when someone is away. Seventy-five percent of users utilize their computers to talk with others online. One could see why computers are bad, but ultimately they benefit a lot of people everyday. Imagine walking into a room where people of all ages are learning; computers are helpful to an individual because they can learn about places. As the saying goes, ""Computers are information in a compact form."" Nine out of ten people use the computer to learn about far away places. The research team had found that using the computer to learn about far away places is more effective than using multiple books. Some can argue why books are better to use, but computers are more efficient. Lastly, computers are great because they teach users to have better hand-eye coordination; eighty percent of people found their coordination improved after using the computer for one hour. Coach Johnson, a renowned athlete, says ""The computer can help to develop stronger reflexes."" One could see why computers might slow reflexes, but in fact they make them better. Computers benefit society greatly. They help people talk online with others, learn about faraway places, and strengthen hand-eye coordination, making them an invaluable tool in our modern world."
880	882	1	3	Dear Editor, should people use computers more? No, they should not use computers more. Computers have many benefits to society but they also have many negative effects on people who use them. People are spending more time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First, people spend less time exercising. Most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in their sport. I am a wrestler and a baseball player but if I don't spend some time a day working out or staying active, I will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game comes along. I'm sure Olympic athletes work out and stay active daily so they can be stronger and faster than anybody else out there, so I don't know why people sit at home on the computer all day. Second, people don't take the time to enjoy nature. Nature is one of the most beautiful things on this planet. Whether you are hiking a mountain or a lake, nature is all around you. I personally love to hunt and fish. I take the time every summer, especially in July, fall, and sometimes winter to go out, enjoy nature, and have fun, and so do many other people in the world. Everyone who sits at home on the computer can't enjoy this gift that we have been given. Third, people won't take the time to interact with family or friends. If you are on the computer all day then you can't go out and be active with your friends, or go for a bike ride with your brother. If you are on the computer you are on personal time that could be being used as a fishing trip or a walk in the woods. If you don't spend time with your family because of something you're doing on the computer, then you are missing out. You won't value the most valuable things that you have in life; your family is important and you should always be able to make time for them. Finally, should people use computers more? No, they should not use computers more. Computers take time away from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. There are good things about computers, but the less time you spend on them, the better it is for everyone.
881	883	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In @DATE1, more and more of the newest technology is being brought out to the public. Computers, @CAPS1-bars, telephones, and more are getting the most hi-tech softwares and machinery to @CAPS8 some of the most meraculous things happen. There is a cell-phone that allows you to turn of you lights in your house from thousands of miles today. This technology can be the best thing that has ever happend to the world. Some might argue that though. But I am here to argue The @CAPS2-sayers. With the new computers, people are able to talk with people all over the world. Also dreams can some true for people that never have the chance to follow @CAPS3. Also, questions that have been asked can now be answered. I have a number of cousins in @LOCATION3 who I only talk to if I go to visit @CAPS3 which is very rare. Because of some of The programs like @CAPS4, or @CAPS5 @CAPS6, I am able to converse with @CAPS7 cousins. Some people say That The @ORGANIZATION2 can @CAPS8 kids like me want to miss out on some quality-time with @CAPS7 family. Well, @CAPS7 brother is going to @CAPS10 in six months and I am going to want to talk with him. With phone companies haunting their costumers with scary prices, @CAPS7 family is not going to want to sit on The phone with him for @NUM1 hours and have to cut into their savings. On @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2, there is an application called i-chat which allows me to talk with @CAPS7 brother and see him as if he were home with me. @CAPS7 dad found out about @CAPS4 and he decided to try it out. As of now, he has reconnected with tons of his high-school Friends @CAPS13 get back in the game. Maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about. Or you can find out what is happening with your sister who lives in @LOCATION1. The @ORGANIZATION2 also allows those less fortunate who can never afford a plane ride to discover a place they've always wanted to go. The internet offers virtual tours of places like the @LOCATION2 of even @LOCATION4- @CAPS14 places can be explored without stepping foot out of your house. Also @CAPS15, a website that offers millions of videos, incudes tourtorials for dances, sports, tricks, and more @CAPS13 you don't have to break into the bank for charged lessons. Another good thing about the @ORGANIZATION2 is it offers mostly reliable information. Sorry didn't get to finish @NUM2 paragraph & conlusion. In summary, these technological tools provide incredible benefits for communication, learning, and personal connection, proving their immense value in our modern world.
882	884	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I've heard that you were taking a survey to see if people believe in computers or not. Well I'm someone who does because they can talk to there family and friends on sites like facebook, myspace, & aim. They can also exercise on the internet because if they go to youtube, then they can find different types of positions that they can do. Today, over @NUM1 people use computers and it is like @PERCENT1 adults anfd @PERCENT2 children use computers which means that more kids today are doing athletic sports. The adults use computers for there work ability and in schools. At newspaper places, they need to have a computer just to type the daily papers and if there's no compers, then how ill the type there work. As people get home from wherever, and they didn't get the daily paper, the you can go online and look at it. For students, computers are so important to us because we get to talk to our friends and when we need to look up something, we just go to the internet. In some schools, they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home. And that's bad for your back, so then schools came out with the books online. For those people who love sports, you can look up you favorite team and see if they won that weeks game. There is also vertual sport games that you can play for that is on the computer. When you first move somewhere oout of town, you can go to google and see where is a good town to live in and a good school system that you would want your child to go to. But there is so man things that you can do online and on computers. So thanks for letting me help you with your decision. I firmly believe that computers are a positive and essential part of our lives today.
883	885	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I just heard that people are spending too much time on computers than with their families and friends. No @CAPS1 is not true just listen to the reasons why in a computer you can find people that you'r looking for. Also @CAPS1 can always help you on something that you need help on and you can do different kinds of activities. If you keep on reading you are going to see all the tipical reasons why I think that people are not spending much time on computers than with their families. (@NUM1) @CAPS2 reason why I think that people are not spending much time on computerr is because, the computer can help you look for a family member that your looking for or a friend. My second reason why I think this is because naybe you never met that family member and you want to get to know them. My last reason why I think this is because @CAPS1's really a person that you really love and need in your personal like. These are the reasons why I think that they are not spending to much times on the computers. (@NUM2) @CAPS3 reason why I think that people are not spending too much time on computers is because @CAPS1 can help you in many things that you need help on. My second reason why I think that they are not spending too much time on computers is because you can do your homeworks their and @CAPS1 can help you with @CAPS1. @MONTH1 last reason is because if you find something really difficult that you dont know @CAPS1 helps. (@NUM3) @CAPS4 I think that people are not spending too much time on the computers because you can do different kinds of activities their. My second reason why I think this is because when your having a @CAPS5 party and you need invitations the computer can help you. My last reason why I think this is because if you want to move to @CAPS3 state or country you can see the place on the website and then you can go. These are the reasons why I think that the computer is very helpfull. (@NUM4) I hope that after reading all the tipical reasons of computers like, @CAPS1 can help you on many things, you can look for people, and you can do different activities, that I really convinced you, also I hope that you really liked and enjoyed reading my letter. It is clear that computers are tools for connection and assistance, not isolation.
884	886	1	3	Debates have come up on whether or not computers are benefiting or destroying society. Computers are only helping in aid in the growth of society. Computers allow people to interact with other people, see and discover other places and people, and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers are helping people more than they are hurting them. First of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. There are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime. Before computers were invented in order to talk to someone you would have to meet with them face-to-face, or send them a letter and wait on awfuly time get a responce. Now people can simply type up an email and hit send. Just like that, their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy. Another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing. All one has to do to display and show their pictures to everyone is done by simply hooking up a camera, uploading your pictures onto your computer, and posting them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any in- the- @CAPS3 person would @CAPS3 that computers are very useful. Secondly, computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people & places that are new to them. In the old days if you did not @CAPS3 about something or someone, like a movie, you @MONTH1 never find any info about them. Computers have internet websites and search like @ORGANIZATION1, that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the @CAPS4 information and pictures or that subject. These technological advances have given many people the general knowledge that they very well @MONTH1 need in any given situation. If you missed the best part of a you could easily go on a computer, look it up and importance of computers in every day society. Last of all, computer hand - eye coordination that is vital to every day life. Typing on a computer in leisure time is a skill that will be looked for everywhere. In fact, many employers @MONTH1 hire you based on your keyboarding skills, ones one is skilled enough they @MONTH1 even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers are not meant to replace your friends, family, and @CAPS5 air, they are very important tools that give you skills you will use for the rest of your life. Any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage. in conclusion, computers are vital in order to properly function in many situations. They allow you to chat and send pictures to loved ones, teach you about faraway people and places that you @MONTH1 not @CAPS3 about other wise, and help one improve on their hand - eye coordination. Computers are very useful peices of equipment that enhance our lives in countless ways.
885	887	1	3	Computers effect a lot of people. I fully support the advances in technology. I support this because computers can let you talk to people that are faraway from you. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. In addition, computers let you learn about countrys all over the word. Rapping it all up, electronics should keep advancing. Say your bestfriend moved to @LOCATION4. You won't see her but you can talk to her on the computer. Now in day there are a lot of websites that you can chat off at or you can also do a webcam chat like ovoo. For example, in seventh grade I moved from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. I was so upset about leaving my old friends. Turns out I was fine. I just made more friends when I moved. I would make plans with my friends over facebook chating. Consequently, computers help a lot you keep in touch with friends all over the world. Computers build up your skills for everything. Hand-eye coordination is the biggest skill that computers teach anyone. When your watching an adult type most of them can type without looking at the keyboard. This is an example of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very helpful in sports. In basketball you should dribble and look ahead. Kinda like typing. As one can see computers help with hand-eye coordination. Google gives you answers to anything. If you have research to do most people use google and google is found on the computer. You can learn about @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4 you name it you can type it in google, and you can learn everything about that country. For example, last year everyone had to pick a state and learn certain things about it. Most people used computers. Computers really are the best electronic in the world. There are many electronics that effect people. But, computers effect people the most. Computers let you talk to family and friends around the world. Also, computer teach you hand-eye coordination skills. Lastly, computer teach you about many countrys. In conclusion, computers should be advanced for the betterment of our global community.
886	888	1	3	Dear residents of @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has been some controversy about whether or not computers are a good thing and/or helpful to society. I strongly believe that computers are a very helpful resource that make day to day life easier. Computers can help us in so many ways including making learning easier, helps students do better in @CAPS4, and serves as a great teaching tool. One reason that I support computers is because they make learning easier. You might ask how a screen and a keyboard can make learning easier, @CAPS1 sounds crazy, but its true! Let's say you're a middle @CAPS4 student that has been assigned to write a paper on a designated topic; @CAPS2 instead of spending hours upon hours looking for the right information in a library, you could just google search what your topic is and @CAPS3! You have exactly what you need to know in front of you within seconds, pretty cool right? Still don't believe computers are helpful? What if I told you @CAPS1 allowed students to do better in @CAPS4? That's right, computers allow students to do better in @CAPS4. Websites such as Edline allow teachers to post their students grades very quickly. How is this helpful? When you take a quiz your teacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes! And with things like absentees, weekends and vacations, the day you get your quiz back gets delayed further. Sometimes kids don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after they took them! By the time you get it back it's time for a chapter test with @PERCENT1 of your grade and you just found out you didn't do @CAPS2 on one of the sections! This lowers your ability to do @CAPS2 on the test. But if your grade was posted on the internet days before, you will have more time to study and know what to study and you will do @CAPS2 on the test. As you can see, computers are very helpful for students, but are they good for teachers too? The answer is yes, computers are a good teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how much your teacher explains to you, it just seems like they are speaking another language? @CAPS2 what if they showed you a cool video on YouTube explaining it? Would you learn better with a visual in front of you? I sure would. Computers are also great for teachers because it gives them the ability to email other teachers if there is a problem and get the latest information about the @CAPS4 and what's going on. Do you understand why computers are useful, now? I hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier, allow students to do better in @CAPS4, and are a great learning tool. These are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and I hope you keep using them in our community.
887	889	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great benefits to our society. Whether it is because it helps people get their work done, or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers, or maybe it's because it helps students study. With any of these reasons, computers are really benefiting our society. Have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next? If you think back, what had helped you complete the paper? Most likely it was a computer. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of college students say that they would not be getting the good grades that they were getting if they didn't have a computer. But, computers don't just help students, they can also help adults in the working community. I know that I have made friends over the years that have moved away and that I have lost touch with. With a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them. With different types of programs, you could most likely find anyone. Whether it's @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults said that they found a lot of their high school friends thanks to the computers. Furthermore, computers are a way for students to study. Students could find search engines and research a paper. Or they could play educational games. With a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likely use a computer to find out what the work was. When I went to the middle school to survey, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students said that they would check to see if it was on the computer before asking a friend. So as you can see computers have benefits to our society today. Three just happen to be that they help people get work done faster, they help keep you in touch with friends and they help students to study.
888	890	1	3	I think that computers have positive effects on people. People can find out important news online, and you can connect with people you don't see often. Also, you can order anything in the world online. These are three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers inform people about important news. If there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food. If there is a burglar going around, people can find out, and lock all doors and windows. And by knowing all this information, it helps people plan events, like birthday parties. Finding out important news is very helpful, and convenient. And @PERCENT1 of people are less likely to face inconveniences, if they know the news. Another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with people they don't see often. This provides an easy way to share events that have taken place, and just have some time to talk face to face. With video chat, you can show off new things, or a newborn baby. You can share what you want with people you barely see. Experts say that friendships last longer if you talk to each other often, and with computers, this is possible. A third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online. If you need a Japanese doll for someone in Ohio, you can order it online. If you are old, and can't go to the grocery store anymore, you can order them online. I have seen that people who can order everything online, don't have to do a lot of driving, and this saves time, money, and gas. This is also very convenient and is less stressful than waiting in lines to purchase an item. These are just three ways that computers have had a positive effect on people. They are that you can find out important news, you can connect with people you don't see often, and you can order anything in the world; that's why I believe computers have a positive effect on people.
889	891	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a humongous positive effect on people. I support advances in technology. It's @DATE1; we shouldn't be finding information in books or writing everything by hand anymore. Life has gotten easier for everyone. Everyone can use the computer for communication with friends or family. We are able to learn things quicker by using computers. Working citizens use computers to help them with important jobs! Everything is done on computers! Computers serve as a great source of communication. Having a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 account allows you to chat with people all over the world. It's much easier to talk to someone online for long periods of time because you won't have to pay for phone minutes! Even @CAPS4 chats are available for computer users. Having a @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 allows you to do a video chat with someone. It makes you feel like they are actually there in the room with you. If you have a close friend who moved across the country, then these ways to communicate would be very helpful to you! You can't have these accounts without a computer; therefore, we need computers! Computers have made our generation very intelligent. We can easily look up facts about anything on the computer. Now, if there's something we're curious about, we can just look it up on Google. In the past, we wouldn't feel like looking in a book so we would just forget about it. Kids could get help with homework online if they are too shy to ask another person. At this point in time, we could even take online college courses! Being able to go to college at home can really come in handy for some people. Computers help us with our education. Adults who go to work everyday really need to use computers! People working in the medicine field use computers to keep track of all their patients. Now @CAPS6 use computers to organize lesson plans and print out reminders for their students. Scientists use computers to do research on things for their experiments. Engineers use programs on the computers to help design what they are going to build. Computers even allow you to advertise your small business or company to the whole entire world. Computers have a really positive effect on jobs in our society, which is a good thing for our economy! Computers benefit us physically, mentally, and socially. Certain computer games can improve our hand eye coordination. We can learn about many things from computers! They really make us more intelligent! Computers give us a way to communicate with long distance friends and family. Websites like @CAPS7-@CAPS8 even give adults a chance to find their soulmate online! The positive effects of computers on people are infinite, but we need to learn not to take them for granted.
890	892	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I often think about the effect of technology on humans. The human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology. New machines and robots are built all the time, and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing. The most widely used machine is the computer. People use it for all sorts of things, communication, awareness and learning and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and I couldn't agree more. Computers may be useful but they are over used. People spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family. Computers are also not always dependable or safe. First of all, the biggest computer users are adolescents. Young adults spend hours on websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 communicating with their friends. At their young age, exercise is very important. Obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common, and it's because young people are glued to their computer screens. The average child needs @NUM1 minutes of exercise a day, and many have very little or none. I say that computers are ok, but only in small doses. The growing mind and body needs to move and exercise. If internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back, some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future. Although it is very easy to quickly communicate through the internet, it can sometimes do more harm than good. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. I've heard parents say they barely see their kids because they're always either doing homework or on the computer. Also, face-to-face conversations are fading. Because of the internet, people no longer need to get together and talk, they just turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not just go see your friend instead of typing all day? Lastly, computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages. There are plenty of dangers out there in @LOCATION1. Online predators lurk in many corners, and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen. The risk of any of these things happening is very high. It's better safe than sorry. So, if you think about it, we really don't need computers to survive. You need your exercise, don't blow it off for online chat. Also, it's very important to interact and be part of your family, and less internet use will cut down the risk of identity theft, or any other problem or virus. It's your time now. Get outside, have a face-to-face conversation with a friend and interact with your family. You can be healthy, happy, and safe without constantly typing away at the keyboard.
891	893	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think computers are a good thing. People use computers for business, allowing them to work efficiently from home or the office. Computers allow you to interact with people far away, bridging distances with ease. They also allow you to do research, accessing a vast world of information online. That is why I think computers are good. Computers can be used for many different things. They can be used for business, handling tasks like accounting and communication. Some people work at home on computers, which provides great flexibility. They can also be used to interact with people far away. You can interact with someone who you don't see on a daily basis, maintaining important relationships. Computers can also be used for research. You can do research on a school project or on other businesses you interact with, making them an invaluable tool. Computers are good for all these reasons, helping people in their daily lives and work.
892	894	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been asked to write a letter stating my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Some experts have been worried people are not spending enough time outside, but most people support advances in technology. During this time, computers are becoming more and more popular. They are very helpful in many ways. They allow you to learn new things, are very helpful for school and work, and they can keep family and friends connected. Computers have a positive and helpful effect on people. To begin, computers help you learn new things. If ever there is a question no one knows the answer to, ""Google it!"" Google, along with many other search engines, are an easy way to find what you are looking for. For example, one day a few of my family friends came over and we were eating dinner. The discussion led to the question of ""who is the actor that plays Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean?"" My little sister typed ""actor of Jack Sparrow in the movie Pirates of the Caribbean"" and there it was, Johnny Depp. Just like that, computers help to get questions answered fast. Computers also help you learn new things like typing skills; just learning how to work them is a new skill. A recent poll shows that a significant percentage of people in nursing homes who learn how to use the computer have much better brain function. Although, there are much stronger reasons as to why computers have a positive effect on people. Furthermore, computers help people with work and school. Computers help you send e-mails for work, make slide shows for presentations, and keep calendars so you can be organised and on time. A large majority of people use computers in some way to benefit in work, making them essential in the modern professional environment."
893	895	1	3	"To whom it may concern, I believe that computers benefit society. Computers are a wonderful household object to have that make life easier in many ways. Computers allow the everyday family to see new places, through photos online, and people, through the internet. Computers also provide a social networking throughout a community, state, or even a country! Lastly, a computer is another resort to go to when trying to accomplish something, because there is always something on the internet that will help you. There's a famous quote that goes, ""the largest room in the world, is the room for improvement."" In my opinion, the computers could make that room a little smaller. While experts say that computers are making people spend too much time indoors, and not too much time seeing the wonders of nature outside, the computer can prove them wrong. The internet is a wide ocean of pictures, words, and sounds. The computer is the item that organizes it, for your entertainment. There is a picture of just about anything imaginable on the internet; from the palm shaped islands of Dubai, to the frozen Arctic tundra in the northern territories. You are able to see penguins in the southern ice cap and the ricefields of Vietnam from a bird's eye view all by simply moving your fingers. It's also possible not just to see places but to see people from far distances! Today, people are sending pictures to and from each other via emails. People are actually sharing their memories with each other, all thanks to the computer. I hope what I have just explained now helps me make my point. Computers are only here to make our lives better. Imagine talking to your friends, without ever leaving your room. This would have been an impossibility fifty or seventy years ago, but this is reality today. People's social relationships have greatly progressed and it has allowed people to keep up with their family and friends. I'll always see this as a positive thing, when using it the right way. Having your friends over to tell them, individually, about your trip to Disney World is such a hassle. If you just put the pictures on a social networking system, like Facebook, or Twitter, memories will be stored through, literally, the clicks of a button. Memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer. Planning a vacation is a tough job to do, but what if that job could all take place in one spot? An entire vacation can be planned, confirmed and paid for thanks to the computer. Jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in a matter of minutes for less using the computer. This allows people more time to go have fun with their lives and not have to worry about planning. Computers allow people to compress hours of work into a matter of minutes. Experts say that computers are taking away people's lives, but I would disagree, because people are seeing new places and people, social networking is more advanced, and time that could have been spent planning is now spent living."
894	896	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, This is a letter about how I feel about the effects of computers. I think computers are great; you can interact with family and friends, learn about things going on around the world, and it could help you with school work. First I would like to say that you can interact with family and friends. You can just go on Facebook, Twitter, or Myspace and talk, send pics, and comment on other peoples things. There are many groups you can join too, which allows you to talk to other people and meet new friends. You can also interact with your family if they have a Facebook or Twitter account. The second reason why computers are not bad is because that there are many websites that you can find different information like science, math, history and all that kind of stuff. There are a lot of different topics you can learn. You can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from. My last reasoning for thinking this way is that many kids do their homework on computers and if people are saying that computers are bad than the parents are not going to allow them to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects. There are many other reasons why computers have a positive effects on people, but interacting with family and friends, learning about things around the world and your education depends on computers for success in today's world.
895	897	1	3	"Dear Editor, The age of the computer is upon us. Everywhere you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree; I feel that the computer is a great way to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good for people to communicate with their family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a way to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of Canada is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is Ottawa. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using items found in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after conference after interview, or, you could simply post it on the internet. It is plain to see that the computer is an important tool in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry son, but we can't fly out to California to see your grandmother. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers, your grandmother over in another state is just a click (and a screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive plane rides, long phone bills, or years going by without seeing a loved one. Computers are not just tools that are used strictly for work; computers can be used for fun purposes as well. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does this make computers have a positive effect on society? I'll tell you how. Many professionals are workaholics, also known as people who work too much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitaire? That's possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitaire and chess. These games are a great way to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us exchange information, talk to family and friends across the globe without a big price tag, and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there who does not like the effect computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society, enhancing our lives in countless ways."
896	898	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have an effect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, it gives online games to little kids. Lastly, you can watch videos that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have an effect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example, if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place, I can go online and look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even their landscapes. Also, the computer is good for book reports; if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5, instead of going through your textbooks, going online you can look up their culture, their food, their location, how their economy is, what kinds of schools the kids go to, and what kinds of festivals they have, etc. My second reason computers have an effect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example, there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer, and that is @CAPS1 and @CAPS2; these two allow you to talk to friends that live far away from you. My friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2; we don't have cellphones so we go online to either @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, ""isn't that great""!! The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places, like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have an effect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example, when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistics say @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school; that's a huge percentage even for kids. Also, when kids play computer games it is more fun to them than sitting in class all day, like my little sibling. In conclusion, these points clearly show the significant and positive impact computers have on how people learn, communicate, and play."
897	899	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1't you love to go on your computer? @CAPS1't you get a lot done on them? Well I think they have a positive effect on people. I strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. These are my three reasons; you can chat online with friends and family, help people do research on projects, and help people get their jobs done in everyday life. So please, local newspaper, keep reading and I will change your mind about computers' effects on people. Do you have family or friends who @CAPS1't live around here that you want to keep in touch with? Using the computer for email or a chat site like Facebook will do that. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2. The only way my family can keep in touch with them without spending money is email. My mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time. If you ask me, I think that is a positive effect computers have. Have you ever researched anything using a computer? I know I have! For a school project in @CAPS2, I had to research about @LOCATION1. I did all my research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have gotten that grade if I did not use the computer to do research. Do you use a computer in your job? Well even if you @CAPS1't, I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work. He is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, which means he manages portfolios. He has to use @ORGANIZATION1 to check on the stock chart. Another example is my mom, a teacher; she uses the computer to email parents if the student needs help or is acting up. So as you can see, computers have a good effect on our society. These are my reasons: you can chat online with friends and family, it helps people do research on projects, and it helps people get their jobs done in everyday life. I hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Say yes to computers' good effect!
898	900	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am aware that some people think computers have a negative effect on others, but I think it's the opposite. Computers have completely changed the world. People can save work on them, visually experience things they've never seen before, or even catch up with old buddies. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. With computers, you can create documents, pictures, and even movies that will stay on your computer forever. How about your newspaper company? Does somebody handwrite every paper that comes out? Without computers, hundreds of copies of your newspaper wouldn't be able to be made every day. Not to mention, what would happen if you didn't use computers and a fire occurred? All of your hard work would be turned into ash, but if it was on the computer you would be able to retrieve it. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because through the internet you can visually experience places or things you couldn't before. If I was going to book a vacation, I wouldn't just trust a book; I would want to go on the computer so I could see pictures, videos, or hundreds of other articles I couldn't see anywhere else. This goes for anything else like furniture, instruments, or even clothes. Computers offer alternative views that books don't. Not only can computers save data and give you visuals, but they give you an opportunity to catch up with old friends, relatives, or even meet new people! Instead of endlessly searching through phone books, you can just type in their name and you are bound to find them somewhere on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely easy. When my dad was in search of his childhood friend, he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! That wouldn't have been possible without computers. Computers truly do have a positive effect on people everywhere; without them, many things today wouldn't be possible. Hopefully, others will agree with me too.
899	901	1	3	Dear local newspaper, In @CAPS1 opinion, I think that those who make computers should add timers to the computers. There should be a law that people have to go out and exercise before and after they use computers. Finally, I think that children should use the computer less than adults for health reasons. @CAPS1 first opinion is that I think those who make computers should add timers to time the amount of time people should take, depending on what they are doing. For example, when someone is playing a game, they spend hours playing instead of doing a different activity. Also, when a person is doing their homework, they start getting carried away, taking their time going slow, and end up finishing very poorly. @CAPS1 second opinion is that I think there should be a law that people have to go out and exercise before and after they use the computer because a big percentage of people are obese. Everyone sits at the computers and starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours, and they don't take a break to go outside. @CAPS1 third and final opinion is that I think children should use the computer less than adults for health reasons because kids are always looking at the computers and their eyes are always getting red. Then they start not being able to see as well as they used to, and they end up needing glasses or a better prescription for their glasses. Also, because kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people they don't know, they can end up getting raped or kidnapped by the person that they talked to for hours. So, local newspaper, will you make that change for the society and for the children? Because I would!
900	902	1	3	I think that computers help people in their everyday lives. They just make things so much easier. Computers help us to find information @CAPS2 we need, book hotels and airlines; they even allow us to interact with our friends. Yes, it might take away time to do other things like exercising, but we can find a way to do both. Every day I go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basketball. People just need to find a way to fit it out. Computers are good for finding information about anything. All you need to do is type in what you want, and within seconds you have hundreds of different links for your desire. For example, if you are in @CAPS1 school and you are deciding what college you should go to, try the computer; it is a great place to get information. People all over the world do that just about every day. It is also a great place if you need information for a project in school and you need more info on your subject; @CAPS2 I say it makes things a lot easier. There is no better example than making a reservation for a hotel or buying a plane ticket. You do both of those things on a computer because otherwise, odds are you would be out of luck. If we didn't have computers, you would need to go to the hotel and get a room, and if there were no rooms you would be out of luck. On a computer, it will say if they have any or not; you would know immediately. Buying @CAPS3 tickets would be the exact same thing. The computer will say @CAPS2 there are available flights to your destination and how much they cost. So @CAPS2 when you go to the airport you are not surprised. Another good reason why computers are good for people is that they help you interact with your friends and family @CAPS2 you can't see them. There are so many different ways you can do it, too. On @CAPS4, @CAPS5, Myspace; all these websites help you stay in touch with all of your friends. Even now they have things where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer. So if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon, you can talk to them then. I even do that with my brother; he is in college and I don't see him that much, so I just start chatting with him on the computer. Now those are some reasons on why I feel that computers are a great part of our lives. Things like finding information and booking hotels, airplanes, etc., all help make our lives a lot easier at times. And talking with other people just makes us happy. Now I hope you see why computers are a good part of all of our lives.
901	903	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that people should stay with computers. I have three reasons for this issue and they are learning, communication, and discovery. I think these reasons would be good for this issue because every human being can do these three things on a computer. One of the reasons why I think people should stay with computers is because they can learn. People can learn by using computers because if a child is interested in something like animals, they can go on the internet and look up what they need to find. Children can also learn on the computer by putting their first-grade jump drive into the computer. Children can learn like this. My second reason why people should use and stay with computers is communication. I think communication is important because you can talk to your friends about various topics. They can also talk about if they want to go somewhere for fun, for example, some good exercise. Another reason why I think communication is key is if your friend is explaining something to you that you do not understand. I also think communication can be had for other reasons as well. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computers is because people can discover different things on there; these things can be bad and some can be good. For example, a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix it, that would be good. And I will know about computers and what to do. A bad thing about discovery on the computer I can do is bringing up a virus. That no matter what I do I can't make it go away and the computer ends up being broken. In conclusion, Local Newspaper, this is why I believe that we should keep our computers, because many people, even young children, can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn.
902	904	1	3	Dear town of Southington, Computers in our town are very important, for instance, for all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job. We need computers for life, and that doesn't make us lazy and forgetful; it makes us busy. The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games. But the only reason some kids do that is because they all don't want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday, but because they want to talk to their friends, make plans, and just talk while they play together. If someone is ignoring their family or becoming more lazy, it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing. And I do agree that people are becoming overweight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week, and that isn't right. I think that this newspaper should post up ads about gyms and maybe that will lower the obesity rate in our town. Or if they think people are neglecting their families, have people work less so they can go home and see their families. As for teens, I think you parents out there need to set some rules like two hours of play a day, three hours on a weekend, and if they don't listen, take the game away for a day or two, but that might not get them to spend time with you because they might be mad, but it will get them outside or at least doing something more active and not watching T.V. or playing video games all day. Also, I know this from experience because I am a teenager and I always go outside and run around when my parents take my games away, and it's better than being at home. Please take my advice and your happy, caring family will always stay together and active and not always sitting on the computer stressing over work and playing video games.
903	905	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, I, a member of the public, am writing a letter to you to inform you what I think about the subject of if people spend too much time on the computer. My first idea is that sometimes people do spend too much time on the computer than usual. It's a problem because some people begin to become overweight and start to lose control over their eating habits. My second idea is that computers do a lot of things for us, but there are still a lot of things a computer can't teach us how to do. So computers are helpful but they're not always a substitute for finding something to do outside, which is sometimes different from using a computer. My last and final idea is that people become too attached to their computers and lose sight of what really matters, such as exercising and fitness. Then people are angry when their computer crashes and forget how to do things because they're always on the computer. And those are my ideas on the subject about if people spend too much time on the computer but not as much time with friends and family.
904	906	1	3	Dear Community, I want you to imagine it's a beautiful summer day. The birds are chirping, the smell of beautiful flowers are filling the air, but instead of playing outside with your neighbors, you are inside trying to master the unbeatable game Cubefield on the computer. Computers have had a negative impact on today's society. When people are engrossed with whatever they might be doing on the computer they become very lazy; they lose the motivation to go out and exercise; people also lose interest in helping around the community. This is why computers have a negative impact on today's society. Statistics show that a majority of people would rather stay inside on the computer than out and about helping and working around their neighborhood. Computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors. Yes, computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances, but at what cost do these technological advances come? Many kids are becoming obese and lack the motivation to come out of their room off of the computer. Computers are making society very lazy; this is why they have a negative impact on us. Computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise. A very close family friend was very obese. She was lazy and never wanted to exercise. Instead of going out and doing something about it, she stayed in her room on Facebook for weeks at a time. Though the computer wasn't the one who made her obese, it was used as a tool to hide behind the real problems. It is sad when many teenagers say they would rather stay inside on Myspace than going outside for a jog. Yes, it's true computers help you learn things you might not have known before, but so do books, newspapers and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Helping out in your community provides many opportunities to meet new people, and it feels like a sense of accomplishment. But the urge to stay in on the computer clouds your better judgement. I know that I would rather help the elementary school across the street build a new garden rather than stay inside on Twitter. If you are inside searching the web, how will you know if the old lady across the street needs help with her groceries? Helping around your community lets people know you care about what's going on. So don't let the computer have another second of your time. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy. They lack motivation to exercise as well as help around the community. Now it's your turn; don't just stare at your computer screen absent mindedly. Go out and toss the ball along with the neighbor's dog. You've heard the facts; now make the right decision.
905	907	1	3	"Dear newspaper and readers of our community, I am a student from the local school; I have recently been informed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way too much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a business. In addition to using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that moved away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone; the only way to talk to them is chatting through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to business, so they are more useful than people realize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentially bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most important thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to people's lives. Think about people who travel a lot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for; don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time."
906	908	1	3	"Knowledge is one of the greatest quests for mankind, always trying to figure out how and why things happen. Thanks to this natural curiosity we have made amazing leaps in technology. A few decades ago what seemed to be impossible is now possible. And one of those many thought to be impossible was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds. I think computers are a great benefit to society because you can learn things around the world in the blink of an eye, they allow you to talk to people around the world and they give you better hand eye coordination. The first reason I think that computers are great for modern society is that we can learn instantly about foreign countries. Years ago the only way you could learn about places far away was if you read it in a newspaper, many of which didn't tell you about faraway lands. Now with the internet we can learn what is happening anywhere we want to know. ""Thanks to our modern technology people are now more informed about the rest of the world than ever before,"" stated Dr. Evans, a communications expert from the University of Michigan. ""Modern computers and the ability to collect information quickly compared to years ago."" Without computers we wouldn't have known anything about the recent earthquake in Japan. Furthermore, with computers we can now talk instantly with people over the internet. A century ago talking to people instantly seemed just about impossible. But thanks to technology that kind of thing is an average part of our lives. ""Many of our advancements and decisions are made while we talk online, even some of the world's greatest leaders make the hard decisions because of this advancement,"" stated a reporter for the New York Times. ""Without this technology many of the decisions made in Washington and Brussels wouldn't be made and many soldiers would have died as a result."" The final reason that I support computers is that they help teach you hand eye coordination. One of the ways that computers teach hand eye coordination is through video games and simulations. In video games people make it so you have to react to movements and notes in order to complete your objective. In the military, computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations. Through these situations, many soldiers have learned how to survive in combat and save many of their fellow comrades. ""The simulations we have invested in have improved combat effectiveness by over twenty percent,"" stated General Miller of the US Army. ""Without these simulations many more American lives would have been lost in recent wars."" So now that you have heard all of the reasons of why I support computers, I hope you are much more informed about this topic. Without computers we wouldn't be able to learn about foreign lands, talk to people instantly, or have as good hand eye coordination. I hope everyone else will see these reasons for supporting computers."
907	909	1	3	"Dear Editor, as you all know many people in our town have been quarreling about computers. Some people are pro computer usage and others not so much. In my opinion computers are a great modern technology. One way computers benefit our society is the ability to access ample information, pictures, and news. Also you can chat with new or old friends. Another good thing about computers is you can also have fun on the web, watch movies, even go shopping. Have you ever done a report on a far away country? Maybe you've never heard of a small nation or a remote city. So what do you do? Search the web! Instead of taking a walk to the library just search one of the many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing or Ask! A large percentage of people nowadays have at least one maybe two computers in their household. A significant number of people can access the web on their cell phone! Can you believe this? Pictures are also accessible on the web. You could find just about anything in the picture search engine. Have you ever wondered about current events in our country or others? On certain sites you can find live newsfeeds or an article about something important such as the earthquake in Japan that recently happened. The internet is benefiting our society today. AIM is just one of many private chat rooms that is available to people. On these open chat rooms you can talk to people that are thousands of miles away. ""I was on Facebook looking for my friend from school and I found her page; before this year we didn't talk very much but now we can talk through Facebook we hangout and talk all the time!"" comments an avid Facebook user. Dating sites are now available, too. There you can meet new people and develop a relationship with them. Entertainment is everywhere on the internet. You can play a variety of games, watch missed episodes of your favorite TV show, stream live movies, watch videos on YouTube, and much more! Many people think there are only pointless games on the computer but there are educational fun games as well such as math puzzles, language tutors, and history quizzes to learn from. Did you know that more than half of shopping for clothes, car parts and other things are bought on auctions such as eBay and Amazon? I recall a time when my dad and I was going to see a movie but we weren't sure what was playing or what times they started at. So we simply looked on the cinema's website. So now you know where I stand on the issue of computers. Computers are a great reference point, can allow you to chat with friends, and provide endless entertainment, making them a valuable part of modern life."
908	910	1	3	"School Board, In the modern era computers have helped mankind. Computers are everywhere in schools, homes and businesses across the nation. They help people in many ways depending on what the person wants to get done. The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends and family, and it also helps me with my school work. I have been alive for thirteen years and have already lived in four different states: Texas, Florida, Ohio, and now California. You would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you may ask? I use various apps and websites. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with them anymore. Moving from place to place was a very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thanks to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen your family in three years, well sadly that's my life; so many birthdays and holidays where all the family you can see is your parents. School is another great example where society benefits from computers; students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opinion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends said this about the computers we use in the library: ""Whenever you don't get something about what we learned in history class that day, you can use the computers to better understand it."" Computers are a great way to research a topic, and that's why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least an hour writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spent writing because it is fast and easy; it is easy to type something, like an essay paper on ways to persuade the reader. In the end computers are something we need in our life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in Ohio through email it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the postal service it would take days. A life without computers is a lot harder, as they make simpler the things we do every day."
909	911	1	3	In my opinion I think that computers have a good effect on people. I think this because millions of people use computers every day! The effects on them are that people learn things easier. There are millions of job sites that would have to do with something about learning. About half of college students go online and do challenges for their courses. If you were a college student and did college online you would: see your family more, it wouldn't be a hassle to get to college, and it would be easier to concentrate being by yourself and learning. Also they even make software which is very popular for learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer. My second reason is the ability to talk to people online. About a third of our daily communication happens through online platforms. You can use online phone services and you can also use applications that have you talk to people for free. I know I have a Facebook account and I think it is a good way to keep in touch with people. So in conclusion I think that there are good effects on people that use computers. Also when everyone that uses their computer they can still enjoy nature and talk to their family in person. So if you don't have a computer you should get one and you will be able to do other fun stuff you like while also enhancing your learning and communication.
910	912	1	3	"School Board, since computers were invented they have grown so much, which makes a lot of people use them more. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but there are negative effects too. I believe that computers are a negative effect on people because people spend too much time on the computer; they are not exercising, there are many dangers, and there is less interaction with family and friends. First of all, a negative effect computers have on people is that they spend too much time on the computer and that leads to less exercise. Recently, I spoke to a local parent about this issue and she spoke out, ""We have one family computer and my son is the one who is always on it right after school to late at night."" This shows that many children are on a computer too much. I have to admit that I personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours have passed. I try to cut back on my computer time, but it doesn't really work out. Sitting on the computer for hours every day also means a lack of exercise. The hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising. Someone's health is very important. Spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people. Secondly, the most concerning issue parents have with computers are the many dangers, which is another negative effect it has on people. Recently the biggest site is Facebook. So many people are addicted to it. Though, it isn't that safe all the time. Another new thing is ooVoo or Skype, which allows you to talk to someone with a webcam. There could be a time when a teen ""meets"" someone on-line and agrees to do things on the webcam for someone they don't really know. These sites aren't safe, and knowing young people they can be in danger. I spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are potentially dangerous to young teens. All these dangerous risks are another negative effect computers have on people. Lastly, another negative effect computers have on people is there is less interaction with family and friends. Instead of getting together with a friend people just go on the computer to talk. That isn't the same as an actual get together. I actually enjoy family parties. Seeing all my aunts, uncles, and cousins is so much better and fun. I do e-mail my family and friends when I don't see them, but I get excited when we have get togethers. Nowadays it's not like that for a lot of people. Many people work long hours and spend too much time on the computer, which takes time away from interacting with others, and that should be more important. The computer also negatively affects people by reducing interaction with family and friends. In conclusion, I see computers as a negative effect on people. Computers make people spend a lot of time on them, have dangerous risks, and take away valuable interaction time. I strongly suggest you look over my points and consider the negative impacts they bring to our community."
911	913	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have been informed that recently, people are questioning the use of computers. Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are changing the way everyday people live. This technology is the basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers. People learn so they can become better at things, be aware of what is going on, and to gain the knowledge that can possibly help them succeed in life. Computers grant access to information that people want to know whether it is to learn how to dance using youtube.com, to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit, or to research a topic for a school paper: computers have it all. It sits right at home so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book; with the right researching skills, almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for. Computers contribute significantly to people who want to learn. Being so popularly used, computers have been improved to make them the best tool for the job. Whether that means faster internet, better research tools, or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephone was invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communication, which is important because it is the main source of connecting with others. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guaranteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their best friend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without necessarily creating a place where people become lazy. Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check their grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want. So when people say that the computer is isolating, consider that if a sibling is away at college, their family can easily connect with them through @CAPS3. When a family is together, they could discover new things since new things are discovered through the computer everyday. This inspiration can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphasize that fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and activities that bring creativity to life. This technology gets people everywhere to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around their block. Even though the actual computer is inside, the fun and creativity can be accessed whenever a person wants it to be. Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new world of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer. Communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people. It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things. Computers affect people in the greatest way and I don't know why some people doubt its magnificent ways of indulging people in the environment.
912	914	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am against the idea that computers benefit society in any way. Yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to worry about what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time for exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time for interacting with family and friends. Computers don't benefit everyone because it gives less time of exercising. When people don't exercise because they are busy always doing something else less important, then you would always be tired. You won't want to do anything but just sit around & do nothing which calls for laziness; you would go weak without exercise. You wouldn't have the strength to eat or lift anything which calls for your bones to go weak and you wouldn't get the calories & calcium & vitamins that your body needs to be strong. You would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape. Since your body has no exercise the weight & fat just stays. Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way that you are supposed to. You will never see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there. And you will always be stuck in the house which is going to get boring & there's nothing fun to do. If you're always on the computer all the time you will never interact with family & friends. That is mostly & always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you. You will miss out on fun important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them. Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, nature and especially family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you are going to see they had a great time & you would want a great time too!
913	915	1	3	"Do computers really benefit society? This has been a tricky question for years. Some people say computers are a huge help and it allows us to see the world through a different perspective; we learn more from computers and this vast increase in technology. Though others say computers are addicting, it is the @CAPS2 unsafe and unsecure machine to be using especially when it is left with a lot of personal files on it while hooked up to the internet. Plus people spend more time on a computer than ever, missing out on their families and friends, not being able to enjoy nature and the other simple things in life. Besides, if you want my honest opinion, computers should only be used as tools. ""The fact is many people look to computers as personal diaries or something to save files on or even something to play games on,"" says @PERSON2. ""They ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier."" This is really what computers are made to do, help us. It could be as simple as a @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or as complex as a super computer but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier. Even if you tried to upgrade a computer it would still serve the same purpose, yet people still look on it as if it were still the next big thing in entertainment. Many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life. Ever since @PERSON1 made @ORGANIZATION2 the @CAPS2 popular disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 around, people have been using computers a lot. Its not because he created the fastest computer ever. It is because @ORGANIZATION2 is selling world wide; for businesses, small companies, schools, even in entertainment. A few years ago they made something called the xbox @NUM1. It revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming. But whats the problem here? The problem is that because of @ORGANIZATION2 people are now more addicted to entertainment. When this happens people will start becoming dependent on a computer. Its not that @ORGANIZATION2 did anything bad but the fact that since @CAPS2 computers have internet, those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse getting all their information stolen. There is this one thing about computers that remains constant. Family and friends will find it hard to talk to there loved one when they spend all there time on computers. This makes communication hard, and like I said before its very addicting. ""@CAPS2 of the people who don't have real friends will chat with people online not knowing who they really are."" says @CAPS3 @PERSON3. Making friends online is the @CAPS2 unsafe thing to do on a computer. Over @PERCENT1 of the people online are not who they say they are and people will often break away from their real friends just to find this new ""friend"" they've made. So remember, even though computers are helpful tools, they come with significant risks that can negatively impact your life and relationships."
914	916	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1's the dilemma @CAPS2 that people are supporting computer technology and others are not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them everyday and it is very efficient for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games. Another @CAPS3 effect that computers have is educational websites; games, and articles. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job. Primarily, computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as @ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide safely for people all around the united states and other parts of the world. My father always told me, ""Computers save people everyday"". Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, @LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacher, Mr. @CAPS4, on his computer every single morning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purpose required. Would you want all those people to lose their job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't. @CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This is things like staying in touch with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could be relaxing to almost anyone. @CAPS6 is an example of keeping in touch with someone else. For me, @CAPS6 is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother while he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website like @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my @CAPS6 contacts deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it lets me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give adults and kids free access to education. I remember my old elementary school used to play many amusing math games. These were why @CAPS5 my education grew greatly due to this game. Games as these are used frequently throughout the world. In addition jobs have been lost from this bad economy. However, jobs are being found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computers saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers. To conclude, I implore you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student, for they are very important. Jobs use them everyday, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why the technology of computers effects people in a good way."
915	917	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects computers have on people are good. I believe this because people can learn hand-eye coordination, they give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk with people from around the world. Firstly, effects computers have on people are good because the people can learn hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is good in many occasions, such as playing sports or performing precise tasks. Secondly, computers effects on people are good because computers give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people is important because people can learn about history and important figures in life, expanding their understanding of the world. Lastly, the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world. This is useful because the people can learn about each other, their customs and religions and also their cultures and heritage, fostering global connections. All-in-all, I believe that computers have good effects on people because they can learn hand-eye coordination, computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and computers even allow people to talk with people online from all parts of the world, making our global community more interconnected and informed.
916	918	1	3	"To whom this @MONTH1 concerns, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that you're doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your computer, open up a web browser, and type ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries, newspapers, and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, interviews, documentaries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips, saving you considerable time and effort. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everything a phone can do and more. You can share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined Facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away from where I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about a month later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who grew up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in another state. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was the son of my dad's uncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also, I recently learned how to use video chat and am getting pretty good at it. So one day my friends contacted me through a service which has all of it. We began video chatting and posting updates. So the computer has also allowed us to share experiences without them having to be there in person. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us to learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you are on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy, but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise routine by using the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective exercises that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patterns which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened almost instantly. Finally a computer allows us to learn about different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient Egyptians lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All these are things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us to access information and connect with others, showing us how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a positive decision about the effects a computer has on people's lives."
917	919	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I understand this focus situation, the effect of computers on our society and people's reactions are less than positive about them and my question to you is why? Computers have a very good effect on our town's specific needs. Computers are aids in tracking hand-eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things and talk to people that traveled here; they make wallets empty faster than the speed of light. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people do things that are safer than in real life. Let me explain more about these reasons. Computers are very good for our society because they are great in helping kids and adults with tracking hand-eye coordination. Just to help you understand why it is important to teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 are so many games that help you learn but help you learn without the risk of getting hurt. In football, catching helps to teach the skill but makes you fall on the ground after being tackled by someone, potentially hurting yourself. In baseball, swinging at a pitch teaches this skill, but if the ball is very close to you it could hit you, or if you do hit the ball it could hit someone and hurt them, taking away your ability to play for the day. Computers are a great way to practice this skill in a safe environment. Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an improvement of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to computer games. Do you want to have a good effect on our town? Well, computers let people connect to the world. You can talk to relatives in far away places without having to travel with this technology. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have more reasons, and I do have another reason. Computers have the ability to store things electronically so fast and easily, making a room look empty. Look on computer's hard drives, @CAPS2 are so much more files that can be stored on a computer, that make a room empty of physical clutter. Before my family had a computer we had a complete room dedicated to papers and files that were so important and that we could not lose. When we got a computer, all the pictures and typed up papers were saved, and our room was empty! I hope that this letter has proves to you the positive effect computers have on our society. Computers help with learning and in the process of improving hand eye coordination. They help to make things happen but if done in real life could be dangerous; they also help to store things electronically faster than a filing cabinet. So now, after reading this letter, I hope you go out and publish this information, telling everyone about the good effects of computers. Again I thank you for reading this letter.
918	920	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? Well I @CAPS2. People are on the computer for hours, sometimes up to @NUM1 hours a day. We need to @CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, and are just making them stay in their house all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting their exercise. The computer, next to the @LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day eating snacks and junk food when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could do almost anything on the computer that you @CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is, which keeps people indoors. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, internet, and ways to talk to people that get them attached to the screen. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one, because the salesman talks them into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more expensive, the better. Also just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download software, games, and mobile apps, that all costs money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollars. Plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pricey computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waste of time. People spend hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and talking to friends, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time you're on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside instead. Think about it, how often @CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting their exercise, eating junk food and playing games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day why don't you think about going outside to get the air you need. Also you don't want to be wasting all of your hard-earned money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with software and their viruses. My advice, computers are terrible for our health and our wallets.
919	921	1	3	I believe that computers benefit society and help people understand things more clearly. Computers help people study, learn, and even talk to other people. Here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems. First of all, computers give you information on things that you cannot find in books. People can look up places for vacations, check what their child's grade in school is, and find healthy food recipes. Without the computers people would be lost not knowing what to do, spending hours searching through physical materials. Next, computers let you talk to friends easily. You can discuss things like the weather, share ideas you have, and you can even plan exercise days together. What if something important happens and the person does not have his or her phone? What could they do? They could go on the computer and tell their friend through email or a message. It would be a lot easier than driving over to the person's house and then driving all the way back, saving both time and fuel. Finally, computers can give you a good sense of hand eye coordination. Computers can teach you how to type without even looking at the keyboard, improving your dexterity. This skill could be used to pursue a good career in fields like carpentry or data entry. Computers can also help you study for a new job and learn what the requirements are for that position. In conclusion, I believe that computers make people's lives a little bit easier knowing that they have vital information right at the tips of their fingers. It can also help them in anything they want to do, like talk to friends, look up information, and teach valuable skills for the future.
920	922	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 more people are getting involved with using the computer and while I think that is great others don't. I believe that using a computer is a good thing because technology is going to progress and computers will be the base, also computers are safer now because of privacy options and virus blockers. Finally, computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you. Although technology is progressing computers are only the basics. Sooner or later everything will be based on computers like, jobs, school, and even the medical field. Jobs will have more computers and touch screen devices because they are easier to use and more technologically advanced. As for school, @CAPS1 students have to take computer classes to learn how to write brochures and make websites. The medical field is now using more advanced ultrasounds that take the image and make it three dimensional for better diagnosis. So, if everything is changing around you why do you want to be stuck in the past? Although, some people are worried about internet safety and viruses, there are ways that those can be limited. As for social networking sites, don't set your profile up for the whole world to see. Set it up for only your friends to see your information. Also, make sure you know who your friends are online. As for viruses, don't go on websites that cause viruses, and be cautious with email attachments. Also, you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them before they cause harm. The computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge from around the globe. You can learn about current civilizations or modern day events without taking a step out of your house. Also the internet has virtual simulations so you can experience what it was like in other cultures, in other time periods, making history come alive. Computers give you knowledge that helps you through your life especially if you don't have a library nearby. Even though some people disagree, computers are the base of technology, safe when used wisely, and full of knowledge, and I believe in their benefits. Yes, they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool that opens up a world of information.
921	923	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Experts are concerned about the increasing use of computers. They say that many individuals spend countless hours on the computer and consequently devote less time to exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree with this perspective. While people are using the computers, they often do not interact and meet new friends in person. They tend to stay inside for extended periods and do not get adequate excersise, and there is a particular risk for kids who might talk with strangers online. When we use computers we primarily chat with friends online and do not really engage in meaningful, face-to-face interaction with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never actually meet them and socialize in the real world, so that is one significant disadvantage of a computer. Another pressing problem is the lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time sitting and this sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise regularly. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy as a direct result of this sedentary lifestyle. Another major problem of computers involves talking or chatting with strangers. Some users might meet some random people online and irresponsibly give them personal info. Kids might even be persuaded to meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and could potentially get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. It is clear that kids and even adults dont interact with freinds in person, lack sufficient exercise, and can carelessly give personal information to strangers, which are serious issues we must address.
922	924	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But my opinion is that the comuter is great and it does not keep people away from other activitys. First, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys because, there are @NUM1 hours in a day, and it's that persons folt if they don't get off the computer, and go do other activitys. Even though the computer has lots of fascinating things, and it is very interesting, people should still have the common since to get off nad go do other things, so I think it's there fult if they don't get off the computer. Also there are a lot of reasns that people don't get out and do other activitys, so why just stop computers. Secondly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because there are lots of destration that keep people away from other activitys, so why blame computers exclusively. For example the television also keeps people from doing other activitys, but their not talking about stopping that. Also the computer teaches you about a lot of thngs, an can so you a lot of things that you don't know about and is trying to find out, such as educational resources. For example your family's history, you could go look that up on the computer efficiently. Lastly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because if people were really worried about there other activitys then they would get off the computer and go do what they had to do. For example if they had to go to the gym then they should get off the computer, and go to the gym because the computer does not make you fat, you make yourself fat, so the should be resonable enough to go to the gym, and not be on the computer all day. Also if you were going to spend time with your family the how could the computer stop you from doing that, you should already know what you need to do and I don't think the computer would make you forget important things like that. So it would be the person's fult if they forget not the computers. To rap this up, computers does not keep people away from other activitys, because it's there responablity to remeber what they need to do not the computers and there are lots more destrations then computers, but it's still not computer's falty it your's for not managing your time wisely.
923	925	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I was sitting at home when I have realized this has to come to an end! The computer bissness has taken my mother and my stepfather away from me, I mean when they are on facebook they are in a whole nother galaxcey, completely oblivious to the world around them. The family spends no time together what so ever, which is very disheartening. Also, they argue frequently, dont sleep properly and again, we don't spend anytime together as a unit! Not spending time with family isn't a good thing for anyone's well-being. Social activity is good for everyone, providing necessary connection. Even if the time spending is not with family, socializum is a very important rollplay in use for developing interpersonal skills. On the other hand arguing isn't beneficial at all. Arguing just decreases the quality of social time spent together. Arguing in my family causes friction to the point where we become unsocial and turn to a computer for escape. Now if were arguing about the computer itself then we have a huge problem that feeds into itself. The arguing will never end if that's the case! Not sleeping is my biggest concern though, when they are up all nite on that stupid thing, oh gosh don't get me started on the exhaustion it causes. I believe they don't have good days during the day when in school or at work. Actually I know they don't because they are tired and irritable during the day. Computers cause my parents to use up valuable family time, fight with each other, and not sleep enough, they spend more time on the personal computer than I'm able to spend with them! @CITY1 @PERSON1, I think we have a problem. A very big one that is disrupting our household!
924	926	1	3	I believe that people spend too much time on the computers, which leads to several negative consequences. If people spend hours on the computer it will often result in bad eye sight over time. They donít get enough exercise, which is crucial for health, and most teens aren't getting home work done because of this distraction @CAPS1. When people sit on the computer for countless hours their eye sight is slowly going bad due to the strain. The bright lights of the screen make your eyes go into an unclear state, and studies say more people lose eyesight from looking at a computer than they would by staring at a normal light. Furthermore, sitting down in front of the screen you aren't down in front of the screen you arents getting any exercise for your body. You mostly just move your hands and fingers, which is not sufficient. If people dont exercise for at least @NUM1 minutes a day, we will all become week and physically unfit. Lastly, your teenager probably fails to do their homework properly. while they are in his or her room they've most likely all the computers as a major distraction. if they spend too much time on the computer they are more likely to fail their classes because they are not studying. which means they will most likely stay back a grade, affecting their future. In other words, people spend too much time on the computer, and this habit has serious repercussions. If we continue this path most people will lose eye sight prematurely. if citizens keep sitting there motionless then we will became an unhealthy society. And lastly, more teens want do homework and wont succeed academically, which is a great concern for their development.
925	927	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer for @NUM1 @NUM2 hours a day, but this is not a healthy habit. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, offering endless information, distractions, and more entertainment than ever before. You can find just about anything on the internet these days, which is both a blessing and a curse. Some people use the internet for doing homework and research, which can be helpful. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment online, which discourages original thought. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie for simple tasks. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the use of computers and such, that could mean negative things for our self-sufficiency and physical health. For instance, the world is suffering environmentally because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2, preferring screen time over active participation. Most people, instead of taking real action, will be on the computer talking about problems rather than solving them. People are becoming more and more lazy these days as a direct result. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement with their hands. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise regularly and eat right, leading to health issues. They are also neglecting to spend meaningful time with friends and family, replacing real connection with digital communication. Instead of texting or using @CAPS2 to contact someon try to call them for a more personal touch. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family in person. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer later on. But your cant get a new family, so they should be your priority over digital devices.
926	928	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people believe that the negatives of computers out weigh the positives. I believe that computers help as much more than hurt. There are a few minor instances where computers have hurt people, but @CAPS2 more instances where they have helped @CAPS2 people. There are some cases that a victim of an accident recovers with the help of computers, using specialized software for physical therapy. Likewise there are other times that close family or friends can talk to each other over the @CAPS3, sharing life updates. Also, people could learn about amazing places through virtual tours. Thus computers are very vital to us. Computers are vital to us because they help our reflexes. In my experience as a computer engineer, I have learned that playing or using a computer call help victims of reflex damaging accidents. A computer helps the victim by giving them a better feel on their environment through interactive simulations. The victem could see exactaly what he is doing and so could his therapists and doctors. Like wise to the physical treatment, computers an relief mental stress through engaging activities. Thus the patient gets stronger physically and mentaly. Thus, computers help a humans life be enchacing their reflexes. Likewise to help our reflexes, computers with the @CAPS3 would help people that are distance apart could connect. One of the ways people very far away connect is with soldiers and their families. Back in my military days, nothing helped better than talking to loved ones. The easiest way of this was talking over a video call. It gave me a gigantic morale boost. Thus computers are vital to as humans. Likewise, computers help us see places that are amazing. For example, when a @NUM1 year-old boy visits a website that talks about the wonders of the @LOCATION1 rain forest, he sees vibrant pictures and videos. He then tells his science class, who the spread the word of preservation of the forest. The boy then grows up to be an explorer of the @LOCATION1, finding new speceses. All this would happen because he was on a computers. Computers help us see the unseen. In the end, computers are great if used in regulation. They help victims heal, soldiers connect and inspire the youth, Computers are vital source of knowledge and advancement for humans, making our lives richer and more connected.
927	929	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself have a computer; it is very important and useful to me for daily tasks. Over @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer, showing how common they are. Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away, through various applications. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in mu opinion, requiring minimal setup. Based on these positives, @CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them directly. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computers you could type ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and receive pages of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that efficiently. They also augment the information I use with multimedia content. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other people, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter, and video calls are better than having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that convenience? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work, saving commute time. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, ""I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home, in my own space."" @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definately. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long and tedious? Look at what they have involved into @DATE1, becoming multifunctional tools. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient for work and leisure. These are major benefits to society, and everybody should embrace computers for the advantages they provide."
928	930	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it will help you with interacting, learning and coordination. By interacting with people like far away friends or unknown frieds online. If they are far its a nice way to send photos back and forth to see how the person/people are doing and staying connected. Family is a very important factor in computers because if you havent seen the person you can tell how they are progressing in life through regular communication. If thats not the case you can meet new people in online communities. By meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust and share experiences with. Learning! Learning is a good thing for adults an children. Computers can teach children by showing them new words, colors shapes and sizes in an interactive way. For an adult it can show them meanings of words or new words for professional development. Words, colors and sizes can all be round on a computer all by learning through educational software. A computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination and motor skills. You can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type and use the mouse. Your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways for precise tasks. By sitting up straight in your computer chair all day can improve your posture over time. Your back can get straigher from all time you are sitting with proper support. Your mind can be foucused and in one pot fucusing on thing is good for you such as the computer screen during work or study. Now, people can think that computers are good for you too for these various reasons. But there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way, which is a valid perspective to consider.
929	931	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both good and bad effects on people. Some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy, neglecting other responsibilities. Other people actually use their computers for things that they need, like work and communication. Also some people need their computers for their jobs to perform essential tasks. I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising and being active! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends? Not me, I would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake, enjoying fresh air. For other people though, the story is much different. Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life and work. A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer, for example working at a bank you use computers all day to process transactions! I also think students rely on computers to do work too, for research and writing. A lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers, making editing easier. Students also use computers to look up information quickly for their assignments. The internet can be a very good source for students to find academic journals and articles. I know for me, the internet has come in handy for school projects, or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word in an online dictionary. I can also see why people dont really care about advaces in technology or computers! Some people dont need them for anything, and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much, which can be isolating. To me, I honestly find computers useful because I can talk online to my family in @LOCATION1, keeping our relationships strong across the distance. I hope you liked my opinion about computers, remember, they are useful to some people, but not all, and balance is the key to a healthy life.
930	932	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and kids of any age at this society, are way to focused on the latest technology. One piece of equptment that is affecting peoples lives, is the computer. We need to get rid of this habbit and learn to do different activites like sports and reading! People are spending way to much time on computers and less time enjoying nature excersing, and need to interact with friends and family more take the time to agree with me as I confront you on how the computer is taking over our lives! Is time flying you by? Are you overwhelmed, at how life passes you so quickley? Well, if you answered yes, stop the computer madness and head on outside for a walk! Your no enjoying nature! Nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 love oceans with pink sand and clear blue water. Who would want to miss this amazing sight? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house, like sunshine and fresh air. Just think you won't be able to see the stupendous, the seasons changing, withought going outdoors to experience it firsthand. ""I want my @CAPS6, to experience the wide variety of nature as she grows old."" @CAPS5 of her daughter, expressing a common concern. Well, @MONTH1 I add, little @CAPS6 is not going to get much nature out of her, if she does not get her eyes unglued to the comuter screen! Yes, comuters, are very brilliant, and have lots to do, but if you want to be missing out on the new trees being discovered every day, be my guest! @PERCENT2 of all the population in the @LOCATION2 is overweight due to technology brought into our world, reducing physical activity. The greatest impart is the computer! high-paid physicians try and teach their parents at a young age, to go out and play sports - while excersing at the same time and nor to stay home and play videogames. Now you tell me, would you rather get a good healthy excersise, and have all the energy you need or would you like to slowy add on to your weight and gain health issues as you browse the internet? I remember @DATE1, I grabred my nike hightops, and my pink ipod I started jogging at a slow pace while listening to my favorite song. Naturally by the end I felt amazing when my run was complete going each day is as healthy as eating a bannana, @NUM1 apples, and cheese eery morning their healthy foods! ""@CAPS7 since technology has been a part of my life, my two daughters have not visited their grand parents in over @NUM1 years! This needs to step!"" @CAPS8 @PERSON1 to the press, highlighting a real problem. Yes, comuters have ""online-talking"" devices such as @CAPS9, but if you are never going to spend quality time with family in person, this is a bad habbit. On @DATE3, @DATE2, my brother and I, were too busy on the computer, we missed a birthday party for the family we are addicted to this device, and need to spend time with our loved ones making memories. @PERCENT3 of all therapy computers have @CAPS2 into depresion and have been with their plains, due to the high amount of to do on this device and less time bonding with members of your family. Who would rather play on a old, gray, computer when you can have fun talking about you day and the game life with your family? @CAPS10's now a never! What will you choose? Do you agree that computers take over lives? If you try and prove me wrong just remember, nature is a big part of life and many people are missing out on the advantage technology is taking over peoples excersing habbits, and many families are less bonding time together. @CAPS10's up to you keep the population of @LOCATION1 in good hands by choosing a balanced lifestyle!"
931	933	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers are not good for the society. There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following; first, people don't get to spend time with their family. Second, you can get misspell words using instant messenger. When your doing your homework you can get distrated by the computer. The first reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family, I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting. When I type something, I use abreveations for any word. The professor at my university says at least seventy percent students spell abreveated words in tests. For example, if you wanted to spell ""what"" instead the seventy percent would spell ""wut"". Finally, my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot. I know that because I am driven to the world of computers. When ever I do my homework, I can't keep my eyes off the screen. Therefore explains that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers keep you from spending time with your family, has students misspelling words, and distracting you from doing your homework. I hope you agree with me on this important matter."
932	934	1	3	"Dear Editor, I strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and the society. My reasons are you can learn and find new information on anything, you are able to talk to people faraway and computers teach skills to use in the future. I will now like to elaborate my reasons further. First of all, going on the internet and search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want. On the internet you can even ask questions, and they will probably be answered. You my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show ninety percent of people who do reports, find their facts on the internet. Google, yahoo, and other search sites have helped children become more intrested in learning. Also, using a computer ables you to talk to other people from faraway places or friends you have not seen in a while. You can even webcam with people. I remember a few weeks ago, my best friend moved to florida, and now we webchat everyday! Talking online will even lower your telephone bills. Chatting online doesn't lost anything, where as the telephone charges for out of country calls cost money. Computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money. Last but not least, computers teach skills that can be applied later in life. Today many jobs in due using a computer, and technology is getting mom advanced. Before you know it will have to know how to work a computer. Also, you probably will need a computer in college. Proffesor Smith even stated, ""every single kid in my courses have some sort of computer."" In college you will take notes and do assignments. Using computers will help you do this and make your life easier. As you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly. My reasons are you can learn and find information on anything, you are able to talk to other people who are faraway, and computer skills will help you in life. Technology is advancing and were going to have to use a computer sooner or later."
933	935	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper Editor, Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on YouTube.com. I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at ten pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around two. The following moring I wake up at six am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am ninety percent sure they are on facebook or MySpace all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper Editor, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people often say ""that would never happen to me"" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sybling might need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on MySpace and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer."
934	936	1	3	Dear Local news paper, I think computers are a bad and good thing because computers keep some people inside more than usual and then on the other hand a computer allows you to talk with family members that you haven't seen in a long time, search for upcoming events and see if they are canceled and to search up other stuff like when a movie is playing. Computers are a big part of school too, because without computers it would be hard to study and for some teachers most of their homeworks aquires you to use a computer. There is some other things that are bad about computers too for example: my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day. Its like when he's on that computer he dosen't listen or hear anyone, not even his parents. He barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him. His parents started to get tired of it so they took his tv and laptop away so he could go outside and play with his friends. After a while he started to come outside a lot mostly every day when it was nice. They gave him back his computer and tv. The only time he goes on it now is rainy days, which shows that a balance can be found with proper guidance.
935	937	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, Recently, more and more people in our proud and courageous country of America have been using computers excessively. Computers were mode to simply difficult situations, such as typing, finding information, and keeping a record of financial statuses. Despite the main uses, many citizens have been using the computer for activities that are neccessary which result in a loss of opportunities to living a healthy, social, life. these are exercise, and spending time with fellow people including family and friends. as a result, please read on so that you, the readers of our newspaper, can understand why computers have became out of hand and relay my message to the readers of your paper. One much important part of life is exercise, and due to the appeal of modern computers, exercise is often neglected, yet it is the key to a healthy life. Personally, I know at least four poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease, known as obesity. The reason for these children is quite simple-they over use, and forget the natural bounderies to using something. Practically every day, each of the four children begin to use their computers from the second they get home, to the moment they fall asleep. this outrageous number of hours denies them the vital chance to exercise, therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children: sleep, eat, computer. This upsetting manor of the four kids enables others to pick on them for being fat, yet they can't fight back, they have no muscle what so ever, thus the over use of computers can result in a over weight child, with no exercise, and no power or muscle to depend themselves from. Another reason whay computers are affecting such a America's youth, is because of less than meaningful usage of them. Everyday I chose to walk from school, for the breathly sounds of type of wheather day should I hope you understand, spending time with your friend and family yet ones again people who abuse computers fail to see the importance of this. Around two years ago, I was on the computer non-stop, chatting online, playing video games, and all sorts of computer-released activities. every day, constantly, for about a year, I came home, to get on the computer, and began my routine, as I remember it. This resulted in loosing the time I had with my family. Furthermore, if I needed to contact my friends, I just messaged them, rather than speaking in person, which felt impersonal. Over time I drifted from both my family and friends and grew tired of this electronic device, called the computer luckily, I use nothing like that now however, I hope that you see the negative side to the computer, and how loosing your family and friends is possible. In conclusion, I guarantee that with all the information about how computers are used, you will see the problem. Hopefully you will publish this letter in our newspaper and demand a column about how computers loose the valuable time for exercise, nature, and family & friends. Thank you for reading my letter, and I will look for an article relative to this subject.
936	938	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a child of the tech generation, or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning. That meaning is life. Our life revolves around technology in general as the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The chief technological preference, computers, is greatly beneficial, arenít as bad as many people speculate, and help us live and prosper in this struggling world. Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a neucence but could never have used aho. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, lets be practical, how many normal people actually wake up and point out the drearyness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously choes t o overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, bag things, and get the cutting-edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Further more, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? Thatís funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companys and saves lives? You probably didnít even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the hubble space carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didnít choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didnít even say that seismologist use computers to traet the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didnít know. So, letís face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did on them. In fact, pardon me. You probably didnít do the research in the first place, instead pointing fingers at the innocent. Smooth move, buddy. Therefore, it is clear that computers are a fundamental and positive force in our modern world.
937	939	1	3	I think having a computer is good because you can research stuff for school projects or personal curiosity and you can meet people and chat with them from all over the world. Computers are important to society because it helps keep track of info like doctor appointments and crimnal records for police to follow by, making organizations more efficient. having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes from the screen's glare. Having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved and have website that they can talk to you on like myspce or facebook or even yahoo chat, which helps maintain those important connections. When having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas, from education to entertainment. Computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school the next day. Having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses for vision correction. The way i look at it as i see is that to much is bad so i think spending some time on it is good do you agree? Moderation is truly the key to a healthy relationship with technology.
938	940	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I disagree because it would give kids, children to do negative thing like being rude, not listening, being loud, not doing homework just because your on the computers. Please listen to why I disagree here are some reason why. I know when i am on the computer my mom every @NUM1 mins what you own because there nasty things on that computers that kids, children be looking at you never now they could learn how to kill someone just being on the computer, which is a real danger. I know when I go on that computer I am rude and disrespectful because when I am on you can tell me nothing because I was into the computer my attention move to the computer completely. Thats why they should have @CAPS1 computers because it takes the attention away from everything else. I don't listen while I am on the computer my mom tell's me to get on "" I will say ""@CAPS1"" I am doing some thing she will tell me to get off i @CAPS1 leave me alone because I am on the computer and because I am focus on the computer screen. And I have the computer loud so @CAPS1 one could get my attention so I have the computer allways loud because my main focus was the computer than I'll do whatever later. O and I don't even remember what be happend when I get on the computer, it's like time disappears. Not doing your school work is another big issue. I know I be telling my mom let me use the computer so I could do my school work and I be getting on different things instead f doing my homework my mom be like t through you were doing you homework and say ""I did finish my homework when I know I did not finish my homework but I only say it because my focus was on the ocmputer. These are reason why the society should take back the computer. I hope you undertand the reasons I give you because the society should really stop giving out the computers in the first place. If you have a daughter or a son and know they have said some of thease things now you know you children have been and always lied to you. Know I could olny the computer for @NUM2 min each day under strict supervision. So yes take them away to protect our children's well-being and future."
939	941	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town. Many argue that computers provide quick easy communication, help children and adults learn, and even teach balancing habits to our generation. I firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society. @CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!"" are the words @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1-year-old @PERSON1 cries out. @PERSON1 has been working overseas for two years in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. One @ORGANIZATION1 the only ways she can contact her father is through @ORGANIZATION3, a video calling service. Communication is extremely important in our society; it brings families and friends closer together. Computers provide a variety @ORGANIZATION1 forms @ORGANIZATION1 communication, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging, which are all fast and reliable. ""@ORGANIZATION3"" allows people to have what can be called a ""visual phone conversation,"" making distances feel smaller. A teary-eyed @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS4 since @CAPS7 wife died, @CAPS7 daughter has been @CAPS7 only companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice every day but see her face, too. It never fails to make me smile."" @CAPS5 and instant messaging also give out society fast, easy communication with others, allowing for quick exchanges. Invitations, announcements, and just a quick ""hello"" can all be done by @CAPS5, making it incredibly convenient. Therefore, computers are very important for communication in our society. Have you @CAPS4 seen the look on a child's face @CAPS10 he/she learns something new? Computers provide an excellent variety @ORGANIZATION1 education in our society, offering interactive learning. For example, toddlers and children can use programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6), which are designed for young minds. @CAPS6 programs teach reading, writing, and speaking to children through fun activities. ""@CAPS7 child used @CAPS6 @CAPS10 he was a toddler,"" says @PERSON3, a @LOCATION1 resident, ""and now his teachers are so impressed by his reading and writing skills. I couldn't be more proud."" Computers don't only teach children; they teach adults, too, through online courses and resources! Did you know that adults learn @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information from the computer? Computers are needed to help people learn in our society at all ages. Finally, computers teach balance and time management. A @LOCATION1 mom says, ""@CAPS7 teenager @PERSON4 has learned how to balance computer and life, and I can definitely see how it connects to other areas @ORGANIZATION1 balance as well, like homework and chores."" @CAPS10 teenagers learn to balance their computer time, they also learn how to balance, extra-curricular activities in school, which is a vital skill. This shows, as a result, that students actually learn responsibility from computers by managing their screen time. I hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary. @CAPS10 they provide commonication, teach education, and help kids learn how to balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can most certainly improve our society and our daily lives in countless ways."
940	942	1	3	"Dear local newspaper committee...., I am writing to you, about how there is a substancial dilemma within the concern of computer use. From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable ""@CAPS1,"" or drawbacks, toward computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @MONTH1 ""help,"" one in obtaining the loss of their social enviorment. Computer @MONTH1 seem helpful but of @ORGANIZATION1 they are a great way to research for @ORGANIZATION1 reasons, like for school or work. But there is also the choice of books for research, which is often overlooked. Computer use has risen to a substancial crisis line, because they are addicting and consume so much time. An example is the well-known link called, ""@CAPS2,"" a social media site. @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize online with friends. But when your child has a @CAPS2 profile, and they are on the computer doing ""homework,"" there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will end upon @CAPS2, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 study on @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games, which are designed to be engaging. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @ORGANIZATION1 purposed of you child's education and health. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2, and online games, making it hard to stop. Computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health and can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 population has increased their weight, due to videogames and computer use? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic of physical health. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit, which is a serious concern. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time without breaks. In the end, computers are a harzardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends and real social interaction. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you in person. But computers see it a different way, by promoting online interaction. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need for companionship. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them, leading to isolation. This also revolves around addiction, as it prioritizes the digital world over the real one. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social enviornment and your ability to connect with others. Computer @MONTH1 seem ""fun,"" but are defuliated when it comes to maintaining genuine friendships. In the end, I beleive that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social enviornment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons against widespread computer use. Computers are not the way to go for a healthy and balanced life. So, try books for a more focused and less harmful alternative."
941	943	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home makes it easier. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I don’t know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topic for school there is always an endless library of information once you turn on the computer. You could get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time to get to a local library. Also, if you have a project in school that you need to type, it is helpful to have a computer at home so you don't have to use one at short notice. This way, you have more time to get extra help from teachers or practice on an instrument in the school band. I can imagine that my grades would be worse if I did not have access to the internet or a computer at home. Have you ever lost a paper or document and had to start over? If you own a computer you can backup your files. Can you imagine an essay of five pages getting lost? Rewriting is boring, but you wouldn't think so if a backup saved you from hours worth of writing! For some people, having a computer can help you make money, and who wouldn't like more money? You can run a business online and avoid the hassle of renting your own space, as a building to run your business can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, you can refrain from making a trip to the store by purchasing items online. Then, the item will be shipped to your door. You save time and money on gas by doing so. And these days, any way to save money is a good one! By having a computer you can boost your education, keep yourself organized, and save money. Although it has many recreational purposes as well, it also can be very helpful in your life. And besides, it is perfectly fine to go online to talk to your friends once in a while, isn't it?
942	944	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 I think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. Because right now some jobs are going bankrupt. And parents cannot help because they didn't have a job to support their loved ones. Another thing is that cars are going up in prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car or truck for great prices. And it can help you save a lot of money in your pocket. For some reason, one out of two people like to go to far away places for example @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. And if you go to these places then you would need a place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends. So you would need a nice pleasant hotel which will have awesome food, comfortable beds, pools and more things people like to do when they are on vacation. And for example if your mother or father wants you to go to your public school but you don't want to because you heard something bad about the school, you can find a great school online. For example @CAPS4, cap pre, classical, brizzal, and some other schools are the best too and fun to go to and be successful with your life. Now you know why more and more people use computers and you should always use technology and it would help you with hand-eye coordination, giving people the ability to learn about using computers.
943	945	1	3	Dear Newspaper, In my opinion I think computers do have a positive effect on people. They can learn about far away places. They let people talk online. It can even help you find a job. This is why I think computers are very positive. Certainly, people can learn about far away places on the computer. Say, someone wanted to take a trip to @LOCATION1; they can look it up, learn the language. They can buy tickets. They could also find interesting things to see in that country. These reasons are why I think a computer is a positive technology. My next reason I think a computer is positive toward people is that people can communicate online. This can help keep families in touch. It can help you find and talk to old friends on facebook. You can even make new friends to talk to. These are other examples why I think computers are positive. My last reason I think computers have a positive effect on people is that it can help you with jobs. It can help you find a job. It can also help you with your job duties. Lastly, it can help you get a higher position at your job. These are my reasons I think computers are important and positive to people. For all the reasons above are reasons I think computers are an awesome and positive technology, I mean just look at all the reasons. They let people talk online. They can also teach you about far away places. And even help you with your job. This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people.
944	946	1	3	According to the @ORGANIZATION1 government, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer a day. A study shows @CAPS1 aren't getting enough exercise, aren't spending enough time with family, and aren't enjoying their lives. Right now people would rather be on the computer than doing other stuff. Since more people have been using the computer, those people haven't gotten enough exercise. Now @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have become obese since they have always been on the computers. One year a @CAPS6 was fit and healthy, but when a friend told him about a website, within @NUM2 minutes he was hooked. After @NUM1 months, the fit and healthy @CAPS6 became obese. The @CAPS6 would always have junk food when he was on the computer. When @DATE1 came, he tried out for his school baseball team. He didn't make it because he was out of shape. After that happened, he went back to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport he plays. Next, people aren't spending enough time with their families. A lot of jobs require people to be on the computer. When that happens a person will forget what's really important to them. A couple years ago, a @CAPS6 was going to have the biggest game of his life. It was the championship game. He was reminding his dad about it all week. When the game was about to start, the @CAPS6 looked into the crowd for his dad. He didn't see him at all. The @CAPS6 was just thinking where his dad was. After the game, he looked again, but now he was sad. His own dad wasn't at the game. His team lost the game. Now his dad doesn't miss a thing since he doesn't go on the computer as often. Finally, people aren't enjoying their lives; they would rather be on a computer than doing stuff they like. One @CAPS6 used to always play basketball with his friends. When he started to go on the computers, everything changed. People would ask him to play, but he would say no. The computer was the only thing that mattered. When the @CAPS6 tried out for his @CAPS8 school team, he didn't make it because he forgot how to play. When that happened, he stopped using the computer and went back to basketball. Now when he tries out, he makes the team. It's now or never to decide either waste your life on a computer or live your life. I would rather live life than be on a computer.
945	947	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay due on plants for science tomorrow. She was absent @DATE1 and didn't know about it. If she had a computer, she could go on to the website and check, but she doesn't. The town took them away. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay. Her handwriting is terrible so her teacher will not be able to score it. What are they to do? Although many some say that computers are not good for society, most know that life without computers would be a disaster. New @CAPS1 is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town. This would be a big problem for everybody involved. One reason is that people need it to get information from search engines like ""google"" and ""yahoo"". They also use the internet for communication like ""facebook"" and ""aim"". Taking away computers would drastically impact every day life. Society uses computers to get information. I know that whenever I don't know something I just look it up online. If I didn't have this resource, my homework would not be as detailed as it is with the computer. Another example is that the public can look up information about the world on my computer. When many heard about the earthquake in @LOCATION2, they could pull up information within seconds. This led to many bake sales and fund raisers. Lastly, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows one day, they can just look it up the next day to get caught up. This is a big part of teenager life. Society needs computers in order to look up crucial information. Many people also use the internet for communication purposes. I know that in my family ""e-mail"" is what makes it all work. My mom makes all her plans by email and sometimes even e-mails herself from work to remember things. Without it, our family would not be able to function. Another mode of communication is ""facebook"". Any time my friends and I have a question about anything that happened that day, we will ask each other on this website. It is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone. A final example is ""aim"". This is a messaging tool that lets you talk instantly with friends and even see them with ""video-chatting"". My friends and I would not be able to show each others outfits and other items without ""aim"". Teenagers as well as adults need to communicate through computers. In conclusion, society needs computers in order to look up information, as well as talk with friends and co workers. Do not even think about removing such an essential tool from our community."
946	948	1	3	"I am so happy, I just finished my school report on @PERSON1 and I didn't even need to leave my house. I was able to talk with my classmate online and ask her questions through a chat program. I also managed to get all the necessary information just from my computer by searching on the internet. I also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the mighty @CAPS1 river, and I learned that skill by taking an online course. This is one clear situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research shows that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vacation use the internet extensively. The primary reason these citizens use the internet is to get detailed information about the hotel and the vacation site. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, because it makes it easier for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the essential info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says ""computers now offer programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill, and @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software."" Everyday @CAPS2 often don't have time to go out and join a group or a physical class to learn new skills. That is precisely why computers are so helpful and people just love them. Instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another significant reason why computers are useful in very positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not being able to get an A in that class. Well, because of computers, forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework assignment and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school's website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, and because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. Let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to connect with long distance friends. That is why the effects of computers on people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is important that computers stay in our lives; they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps your business running efficiently and effectively."
947	949	1	3	Many people in society think computers are bad, but I think computers are excellent. Computers allow you to communicate with your friends, family and relatives easily. With a computer you can do homework extra fast, without having to go to the library to look stuff up in heavy books. Computers also allow you to take out your anger on ones and zeros in a harmless way. Many experts like @ORGANIZATION1 think people will talk to strangers on websites like Facebook and Myspace. If a parent places their son on these websites and also makes it so only friends can view the profile, you will be a lot safer. Communications engineer @PERSON1 says that it is better for people to talk to relatives online than not at all. I know he is correct because I have relatives in @LOCATION1 that I love talking to but they are @NUM1 miles away so communication was hard to get, then I got a Facebook account and it is like they are next door. @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 expert @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of strangers that are molesters or thugs go after people who don't protect their profile, so protect your profile and be safe. Computers are better than going to the library! This is true because going to the library means you have to round up the kids, get in the car and go. With a computer you can just go into your office and do research from your chair. That saves money on gas and is more convenient. If you have a project you can just send it straight to the teacher via email. In many cases today, experts like @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 are conducting experiments that are rigged. Violence they say is caused by the games but they use test subjects like the bad people you don't want to meet. I have found video games to be a great outlet for stress built up during the day. Many of my friends have also found this to be true. Video games make you think and solve problems, that is also a reason they are good. In conclusion, computers are excellent. They make it so there is the ability to communicate with friends and they allow you to take out your anger safely. What is not to love? Get a computer now!!
948	950	1	3	Each year the world becomes more and more advanced in technology. Technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way. Computers are a part of this positive technology and definitely benefit society. Computers help us look up places and things we have never seen before and they teach us about them, too. In addition, computers have a positive impact on families and benefit them greatly. Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends easily. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and make life easier and more fun. To begin with, computers help us expand our knowledge. It helps us look up facts or recent news quickly and efficiently. For example, just recently the @DATE1 @CAPS1 occurred and they usually go late into the night so I didn't get to see the whole competition. I could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals. Computers helped me by allowing me to look up the medal results quickly so I wouldn't have to wonder who won a medal or not. Computers help us expand our knowledge all the time. They help us look up facts for a report, places we want to travel to, learn about the benefits of a certain pet and the possibilities can be endless. To continue with, computers help families by bringing them closer in a way. A family member could be watching a funny video on YouTube or @ORGANIZATION1 and could think it's so funny that they want their whole family to see it too. In addition, stores sell clothes online now so a mother and daughter can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together when we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when we choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night. As a result, these things the computer gives us brings out discussion in the family and gives a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about. Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together socially. There are many ways to communicate on the computer these days. There is Facebook, Twitter, email, AIM, and many more. They are all different, but they have one thing in common which is to bring old friends and new friends together. For instance, my mom just signed up for Facebook so she can talk to all her old friends from high school and she found one really good friend who she hasn't seen in ages and it made her really happy. Therefore, it shows that computers aren't just for bringing new people together, but old ones, too, strengthening long-lost bonds.
949	951	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts when they say people are spending too much time on the computers. The reason for this is that one, people don't get enough exercise. Two, new websites have been made and people want to see how @CAPS1 works. Three, more and more teenage kids have the new technology. They're on @CAPS1 all the time, and don't realize they're not spending any time with their family. Now that you know that, let's move on to my first reason. First of all, people are spending a lot of time on the computer and they don't have time to go outside and exercise. More people probably figure they don't need to go outside. Really they do, @CAPS1's important that they get their body moving and blood flowing through their body for good health. Another thing is that we don't always need to get the answers off the computer. @CAPS1's easy to find a friend and play a game with them outside. Find something to do other than play games on the computer. Now that you know, let's move on to the second reason. Second of all, the computer network came up with new ideas for the computer. They now have Facebook and other social sites. More and more people use Facebook now. This right here shows us they won't get out and play, and this also means most kids won't do their homework on time. Another thing is that either parents should set a time limit on the computer or they take @CAPS1 away. There is just so much amount of time you can be on the computer for and not get bored or tired. Now that you know that, let's move on to the last reason. Third of all, I would like to say people are spending more time on the computer than with their own family. The reason I say this is because @CAPS1 is important to spend as much time with family and friends instead of being on the computer for @NUM1 hours. We need to know also what's going on in our daily life with our loved ones. Another thing is that our family is way better than some game on the computer; go outside with your family and play a game of wiffle ball together. Now that you know that, let's move on to the conclusion. In conclusion, you have read an essay talking about how people spend more time on the computer rather than go outside to exercise, new websites keep them on longer, and they are not spending enough time with their family and friends. @CAPS1 is important to have a time limit on the computer and get up and moving. Don't be a lazy couch potato and sit on the computer all day; get out and spend time with your family and friends, I hope you agree with me and take this advice to heart.
950	952	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the concerned experts, and I'm sure many others agree also. I bet you that if you keep reading it would be understandable, why I agree. First of all, too many people spend too much time talking with friends online. I think that once you start talking with them online, you should finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone. Talking online is a great way to connect with friends and people you haven't seen in a long time, but too much of that can start problems. For example, rumors can spread quickly. In my opinion when friends get too excited online they decide to start rumors about other people and it ends up being sent to almost everybody in the school. Another example is online arguing which can lead up to many problems like physical fighting when you get back to school. How would you feel if you turned on your computer and found out that someone has been talking about you or that someone is trying to start a fight with you? I'm positive that you would not enjoy it and your feelings might be hurt. The next reason is, being on the computer too much can effect most people's grades negatively. Many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying for a test. There are many people who go to my school and their grades have declined because of excessive online usage. Pretty soon many people will be held back because they have failed the school year. For example, picture yourself as a parent and getting your child's report card and finding out they have all @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's. You wouldn't like that either. Lastly, computers have caused another problem called cyberbullying. Too many children are being bullied online and they are being hurt emotionally. Those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad and feel alone, thinking that nobody cares about them. Bullying has caused death or many other serious problems. Imagine being someone who is getting bullied and your feelings are really hurt; you don't talk to an adult or a parent and all you end up doing is killing yourself. Picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too, to find that their child has been bullied to death, it really hurts them deeply. And I'm sure if you were one of those parents you wouldn't be too happy. In conclusion, being online too much has a negative effect on everybody and it is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by parents and schools alike.
951	953	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 the world having a network where people can connect, learn and work efficently. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help @CAPS3 connect with far-away places, develop hand-eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area. @CAPS2 being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world, unable to enjoy the beauty of @LOCATION3 or send help to the starving people in @LOCATION2. @PERCENT1 of money donated to @ORGANIZATION1, an organization that assists in global disasters, comes from online donations. Without the computer how would our willing people help the rest of the world, or even know about the rest of the world? Give our community the ability to reach out to the farthest parts of the globe, give them computers. Computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else. Playing baseball simply doesn't require enough focus. The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand-eye coordination that could save lives. @PERSON1, who trains the @CAPS3 air force, weighs in on the effects of computers. ""They have made a great deal of positive impact,"" he states. ""@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots."" @CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well? The computers we own train @CAPS3 as we use them to have reflexes and hand-eye coordination equal to the best of the military. Computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster. Before computers, @CAPS7 and calculating took @PERCENT2 more time, but now they get our work done quickly and without error. @NUM1 year old author @PERSON2 states, ""@CAPS4 computer helps me type @CAPS4 writing a lot faster and it is done right, more importantly."" @CAPS7 and typing is just more efficent when you are using a computer; accountants, students and even the journalists for your own newspaper need the computer to work faster and more efficently. Don't stunt our community's workers, give them what they need: computers! Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. Our community benefits from the computers that help @CAPS3 connect with far away places, give @CAPS3 hand-eye coordination and help @CAPS3 work quickly and correctly. So explain in your next article that we need our computers. Computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them!"
952	954	1	3	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are out! The effects of over-use on a computer can severely change a persons life! People who are spending too much time on their computer will most likely spend less time exercisizing, enjoying nature, and interaction with their family member and friends. I believe that the act of computers overwhelming a person's life should be with in a serious manner. Exersizing, an essential part of anyone's life, has suffered; since the development of the internet forty years ago, the average @CAPS1 or body mass index of an average person has increased fifteen percent! This is no coinfidence, computers are causing more and more people to avoid challenging themselves to run that extra mile, or swim that extra lap, and instead go home and play on their computers. This not only is hurting peoples' weights, but excersize equipment store owners are having to close their shops, because less and less people are coming in to work out, or excersize like they should everyday! Our children are also being affected by this addicting sensation; childhood obesity is one of the main effects on children, because when they get hooked playing on these they as well stop excersizing, and play videogames. The average amount of people who went to @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 every year was around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer the attendance dropped to a mere @NUM2 people every year. Less and less people are able to enjoy a fresh @DATE1 and instead spend it indoors on their country. This is hurting people as well as the wildlife around them. The ratio of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3 in @DATE2, the year the computer was invented. But a mere ten years later, it changed so now their are fewer squirrels! This is because now that there are less people, fewer squirrels live in the @CAPS3 @CAPS3, and went to find food by themselves. Tour guides who worked in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, were being fired, due to less people wanting a tour, so less tour guides are needed. Families are seeing that the more a person plays on a computer, the less time that person is going to spend talking to @LOCATION1, or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Scientists held a test with three different people: one spent an hour reading a book, another spent an hour on a computer, and a third spent three hours on a computer to see who could stay in a conversation with their mother the longest. The first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother, the second only ten minutes, and the last, a mere five minutes. This shows that the more time spent on a computer, the less interactions are held between son and mom, an important relationship in any one's life. Mother's worry that the next time they have a barbeque, @PERSON1 won't be in his room, playing on his computer like last time. @PERSON2 was chosen to conduct an experiment where @PERSON2 had three freinds, @CAPS6, @PERSON3, and they all showed similar declines in family interaction. We must address this serious issue for the health of our community.
953	955	1	3	I walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. I saw the front page talking about computer use. An article said people are using computers too much and are not exercising. I thought the article was going to say we shouldn't sell more computers, but it mainly said that people are using computers and are not exercising much. I think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer if they try. I had a friend that didn't know how to use the computer. He passed his hours playing outside. In the @DATE1 he tried out for @CAPS1 baseball. He is a very good athlete. He does great in school too. Other people without a job are not looking for something to do; they are at the computer everyday. When they should be doing work around and inside the house. Peoples with computers shouldn't be on them all day. Like this friend my friend has; he is using his computer everytime he comes from school. He doesn't do his homework on time. Every time he doesn't want to go out and exercise his mind or get a little bit of sun; he sometimes doesn't eat so he should give his brain a rest and do physical things that will help him. Another person, such as a computer worker, should write a note to people with computers saying how computer can be addictive and maybe they will realize how often they should use their computer. I knew someone who was using it to go to get information and for collage work. She started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage. I believe that computers are a major impact on people. People should be going about to have fun and get sunlight, not staying at the computer all the time. Many adults don't use the computer; it is mostly the teens and kids. People should go to the gym and build strong muscles. They should stay away from computer for a time. Taking a stand against computer overuse would be the right thing to do for our health and our future.
954	956	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people that excersise and go on the computer mainly, so I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise from online videos. Sure, some people just chat and learn about that far away place, but they could also use that information to go there and explore the buety and nature. I think computers have great effects on people; They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2 uncle that came from @LOCATION1; he learned how to speak english from the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are significant. People have classes online; they go to school virtually. For @CAPS3 mothers that are single that have kids, for example, they get their diplomas and degrees off the computer online. And theirs other @CAPS3 @CAPS2 aunts and uncles; they go to english classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. @CAPS3 I go on @PERSON1 all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. @CAPS4's fun, but also educated. I think that all computers have positive effects on people. All of them should; their should'nt be one computer with negative effects on people. But that's only by @CAPS2 opinion. Computers are like @CAPS3 robots; they do lots for us. We type reports, learn, read online. And then theres also were we play games online, and educated games. I believe that their are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example you could search up: mistery, animals, natures and places. You wouldn't beleive how many results the computer has. So who would have negative effects from the computer? All @CAPS4's trying to do is help us and out education; @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2 spanish sometimes. So why would people think that computers arn't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tommorrow. Also I could see what the news are, and i could contact @CAPS2 teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people and is a valuable tool for learning and connection.
955	957	1	3	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I am deligted to write this letter to you. It has come to my attention that the people who support advances in tecnology believe that computers have a positive efffect on people. I agree with those people. I agree with them because one: you can communicate with your family and friends via email, via @CAPS2, via @CAPS3 etc. Number two: you can use a computer for research, and number three: it can tell you directions or give you info. on a resteraunt or place you want to go. I will now get into more detail on these three topics. You can communicate with your family or friends via computer. For example my friend Amor, when we were best freinds and we were in third grade, he had to move to @LOCATION1. I cried the first day he moved. then the next week or so I got an email from him and so now we can keep in touch with each other. He comes to @LOCATION2 every @DATE2 and we hangout with each other. Maybe one day, I will like to go visit him now in @LOCATION3 becasue he moved again, but I will have to do some research on @LOCATION3 first. With a computer you can research alot of things; like this year our language @CAPS4 class read a book called ""My Brother @CAPS5 Is Dead"" and it was a true story. So we had to do some research on the book and I found out many details online. Without computers how would I be able to research anything? The website shared where everything is, a description of the thing, and how to get there (diretions). Directions are very important. They show you how to get to a certain destination. You can get directions off a computer. I remember one year I had to go to my friends birthday party and we didn't know how to get there. So I went online on @DATE1 and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer we would not have been able to find the house easily. You @MONTH1 disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also became very addicting to some people, but I think I am right. Thank you for reading this letter, once again computers are good for the community and for study!"
956	958	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. For instance, you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting fresh air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere on the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is preventing you from doing. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. This is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. You can use the computer but just don't stay on too long because you are missing the fun all around you.
957	959	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the affects of computers is that while there are good benefits that come out of them, I believe more strongly that negative issues and situation arise from computers and that they affect people with greater impact in a not so good way. @CAPS1 three main reason as to why I think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are @CAPS2-bullying is a very big issue. Also there are many 'scams' and 'cons' out there on the @CAPS9. Lastly there is a lot of mis-leading or wrong information online. Going back to @CAPS1 first reason, ""@CAPS2-bullying."" @CAPS2-bullying can be defined as rude or nasty teasing over the @CAPS9. On social networking websites such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and so on. '@CAPS2-bullying' can include teasing, hurtful comments horrible name-calling and foul language. It is much more effective than regular bullying, such as ""Give me your lunch money"", because once you put words out on the @CAPS9, you can never take them back, no matter how hard you try. '@CAPS2-bullying' is the new generation of mean. Secondly, scamming and cons come out of the @CAPS9/computers. When purchasing items online, you never really know what your going to get. @CAPS1 father was scammed, or conned on the @CAPS9. He was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to get it. He took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at our @DATE1 home, and the engine and motor were broken. That is what can happen when buying something off of the @CAPS9. Lastly, mis-information can be another negative impact from computers. When researching a topic, you should stick to the library, it @MONTH1 sound old-fashioned and slow, but when you research on the @CAPS9, you need to remember anybody can put or post anything, even mis-leading or untrue statements and 'information' online. Researching topics is not the only way to get false information. People can pretend to be who they are not in real-life, which is why anonymous chat-rooms and instant messaging are dangerous and un-reliable. As a conclusion, the @CAPS9 basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Because @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning and mis-information are all negative factors of the @CAPS9, and out-weigh the positives significantly."
958	960	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers are not a benefit for us because we spent to much time on them not every one has a computer and they cost of a computer. Every one doesn't know how to use it. If we timed many hours we spend on the computer people would be amazed at what they sound. People spend looking up random things when they could be outside riding bikes or going for a walk. And you cant do that with a computer. Not everyone has a computer because that cost so much @MONEY1 a basic computer can cost upwards of @NUM1 and more and thats @MONEY1 sure their computer. Then you have to pay for the internet which can so for @NUM2 a month. And you have to pay for certain apps like (windows, microsoft ect.) The bill on a computer up after a while and people dont realize that when they are paying for the internet they arent getting allot what the cable com says they are giving you. Not every are knows how to use a computer like older adults dont know how to really know use the full potential of a computer. Because they never learned how to use computer. In this is the computer arent a hose help for our society because of the time and the cost and the knowledge on computers required to use them properly.
959	961	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negative or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising little time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valuable exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only take away from that kids well be on facebook instant of eating a nice meal with their family. My @CAPS2 always told me stories of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now kids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it tells you where go. What happens when it breaks? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must stretch the negative affect of computers to our health, our relationships, and our independence.
960	962	1	3	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about foreign places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about foreign places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Also, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history class, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Second, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using my texts and running over the phone bill every month. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hasn't seen since he moved here from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on youtube and type in""nike sb skate lair demo"" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount and the benefits they provide are substantial."
961	963	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers. A lot of teens spend a lot of time on computers, a view I hold from my own experience and which was supported when I surveyed @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class. I would first like to expand on my idea that teens spend a lot of time on the computer. Some teens go on the internet to do homework or might check their emails, while others go on @CAPS1 for hours and get addicted, meaning they're not outside or doing sports. In my own experience, I used to have a @CAPS1 account and I would be on it for the whole day, missing out on hanging with my family and friends. So I deleted the account. But, I still feel addicted to the computer; I'm always listening to music or chatting with my friends or checking my emails, like most people do these days. And lastly, regarding @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of people are on it for a significant part of a day, and @PERCENT2 said that they spend a considerable amount of their time, which is @PERCENT3 of the class, on the computer. This is just one @NUM1 grade class, but it shows most students are addicted to it, no matter what age. This is why I believe that people do spend too much time on the computer. Many students go on @CAPS1 for hours at a time, and in my own experience, I have been addicted to the computer. When I surveyed @PERSON1's class, there was a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer. So parents, please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer for their own well-being.
962	964	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever wondered how much the world wide web has to offer? I would definitely agree that computers have a beneficial effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and they give people the chance to reconnect with old friends or meet new people. The internet has so much to offer and is absolutely beneficial. Studies done by @PERSON1, a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1, stated that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer typing have better hand-eye coordination than those who do not. You could be improving your coordination and not even know it! Intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you. There are many computer games out there that require you to react quickly and call for fast reflexes and hand-eye coordination. I know personally that it has helped me. Since @CAPS2 has been on the computer more, I have noticed that my reaction time has shockingly improved! Yes, I know that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can exercise and improve your hand-eye coordination; either way, you can't go wrong. The massive sites in space-like, high-tech, fascinating worlds are accessible through computers. The technology of computers allows us to learn about far away places. Kevin, a scientist, stated that @PERCENT2 of our knowledge about space comes from computers! For example, think about Google Earth; it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! I think you would agree that without computers we would lack a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. Would you rather we not have computers and not know half the stuff about where we live? Through these high-tech computers, we can learn about life outside, like space and other galaxies. Did you know that @NUM1 of the population use the computer to talk and reconnect with friends and family? I know I do! I know that people shouldn't be too dependent on the computer for talking to people, but it's a great way to stay in touch. They have awesome websites like Skype and Oovo that allow you to chat with other people online. Friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from high school or even way back to grade school. Another great aspect of online communicating is that long-lasting friendships can be created. Newly explained, now they are not just online; they got so close they became real friends! Personally, I know that I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like Facebook helped me keep in touch with them. Clearly, this is a great source to use! The time has come to decide; the choice of using computers would definitely be a wise one. Without a doubt, it will certainly help you with hand-eye coordination and keep you talking or reconnecting with people. Most importantly, it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places. So don't make the wrong choice; appreciate and use all that computers have to offer.
963	965	1	3	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you want to learn good hand-eye coordination? @CAPS1 you want to have the ability to learn about far away places? And @CAPS1 you want to talk online with other people? If you said @CAPS3 to all of these questions then using a computer is the way to go! While using a computer you can @CAPS1 many things. You can look up a good healthy recipe for your family or find a good relaxing place to @CAPS1 your daily yoga. Although some people say that using a computer cuts down your time for exercising and enjoying nature, it really doesn't. A recent poll was taken at the Planet Fitness in Newington @CAPS2, and it showed that @PERCENT1 of the exercising people discovered Planet Fitness through the internet. @PERSON1, a nature expert from the department of health and wellness, said ""@PERCENT2 of my customers take online courses for exercising at home so that they don't have to be in public."" @CAPS3, I know it seems lazy to not go to a gym, but some people are terrified about what others think of them. I mean, who doesn't want to exercise in the warm comforts of your own home and not have to go to a sweaty old gym? All right-minded people would stay at home and exercise from their computer and not have to go to a sweaty and smelly gym. So it's never a bad option. @CAPS1 you go to a sweaty old gym, or @CAPS1 you stay at your beautiful clean home with the internet? Imagine, as soon as you get up well-rested, instead of going to a yucky gym you can stay home and enjoy a relaxing walk in the comfort of your own home. Certainly, you care about your nose and want to be able to smell a nice warm apple pie. But if you don't, that's fine too. So don't go to a gym; stay at home and enjoy your day with your internet!!! I say stay at home and love your internet for a healthier, more convenient lifestyle!"
964	966	1	3	Dear the daily newspaper crew, I have seen some of your own articles disagree about using computers. I for one believe that using a computer really isn't that bad. For example, the computer is actually good for education. Many use them to create @NUM1 images of things for school projects or science fair projects. I use these machines to play video games to cure my boredom, like most young teens and children do. Unlike most people, I don't stay on it forever; I usually play for a couple of hours. There are some downsides to having a computer in the house. For one, the machines use up loads of energy in the house, making the electric bill rise, especially around @DATE1. On some websites, there are people who try to be stalkers, like on the website MySpace and Twitter, but on the bright side, those who try to be stalkers usually instantly get caught and put in jail. Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. For example, children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or do things for themselves with their parents watching, and they learn hand-eye coordination. Many children who play sports and have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual. So you see, computers are not that bad. So please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned; they would lose these valuable learning tools.
965	967	1	3	"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are a relatively new invention, and they have become very popular. Computers allow people to talk online with each other. They also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects. Computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that won't get lost. Computers are helpful in so many ways, but these are just a few. Computers allow people to communicate online, whether it's through email, instant messaging, or a video chat; computers replace old and outdated ways of @ORGANIZATION1 communication. For example, instead of writing a letter to someone, mailing it to them, and having to wait two days for them to receive it, you can just email them! Obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. They will receive the message instantly and can even reply soon enough. @PERSON1, president of @ORGANIZATION1, says, ""Computers are an important part of technology. People use them every day."" Using them every day doesn't mean just for fun; it also helps with work. Three out of four adults who used computers say that they help them with their work and social status. Computers are a part of everyday life, and they can help with almost anything. Computers allow students to finish homework and projects quite fast. Instead of hand-writing that four-page essay on @PERSON2, you can use textbooks and the internet for finding information. Computers also allow students to email teachers in case they missed classes and assignments. @CAPS4 @PERSON3, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 who had missed quite a few days of school, says, ""All I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me all the homework assignments. I missed nothing, and it was that easy."" @CAPS4 is not the only one who agrees that computers are a big help; millions of kids and adults agree. Computers not only let students write reports; they also allow them to save them for future uses. They also save important files and precious pictures. Everyone hates it when their camera or video camera breaks and their precious and wonderful memories are gone. Well, just save them to the computer, and they're there forever! @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who store their pictures in a computer agree this is the best way to do it. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people. They allow people to talk online, do homework and projects, and store important files. I can assume that everyone agrees with me that computers are an important part of everyday life. We just wouldn't be the world we are without them."
966	968	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate money and needed items, providing crucial aid to the affected region. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are looking for. You can also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless uphoria of information regarding his death and his life's work. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love, discussing new songs and concert dates. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one and discover these benefits for yourself.
967	969	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I don't agree I think the experts are correct that people are spending too much time on their computer. My following reasons will explain why I don't agree. I think there is also an issue with computers. Please read on to understand my reasons. First of all, my reason on not agreeing with those who support technology is because their is no saftey! I think chatting online is great but dangerous. For example, most kids are followed by predators and its usually online. This is because they share personal information all to unknown people. Also, kids get into dangerous situations for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to. Secondly, I don't agree because it also caused addiction to the computers. Most people get addicted for the certain things they do online. These life of addiction can also become dangerous. For example, people play some video games wich people killing and commiting crime. We cant not do in the ""real' world. These kind of game also bring people to dangerous behavior. Another example is we've had students bringing weapons because violence is the answer when it is not! The addiction to computer is so bad that people do have a look of reality and interacting with real things. Lastly, I dont agree because its also unhealthy. Most people who are addicted sit for hours and again. These habits can turn into an unhealthy life because you are not enjoying the real world at all. For example, people die of heart problems from lack of activity. This letter will hopefully effect others so thanks for reading. Hopefully, people understand why I dont agree with excessive computer use."
968	970	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society is much more different from what it was like twenty years ago. We have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please just like a computer. Our access to such a large network beings us together, can broaden mental horisons and keep many @CAPS5 hard workers on key point so that when time for work comes around, they are ready. Not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing well, but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms. Our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons. They vigorously build sley scraping towers, educational fucilities, additions to our health center, and even the very places we call home. However, when weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazzardous in the long run, they must still ramain at the ready when duty calls. Lately, there has been an advancement in technology to help chane opperators maintain their skills during their of season vistually. It @MONTH1 appear easy to the untrained spectation. To one it @MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a chair, pull a few levers, and push a few buttons. However, there is in fact a persition to such a task. Pull the lever to quickly and the crane can go sharply in the wrong direction causing it to tip over. One of feild reponters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a new @CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs at our builders. That just goes to show that @CAPS5 one does not keep such skill in check, they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site. I, personally, find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, @CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home, my studies would be near impossible. With @DATE1's economy going to a class outside & school, or even hiring a personal tutor, can be enough to effect anyones budget emensly. The internet provides an efficient low casting, or even free, way to help any language learner. One can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language. In @DATE1's society not everyone has the time to go to he library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in. Some @MONTH1 say that asking a neighbor about their home canbe just as afective, but that can awkward for those that don't particulary do well in face to face setting. However, havbing a complete computer at hand can make learning an enjoyabl experience. Once can find blog posts about someone's visti to there country of interest & even videos of their time there. Websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful. On the other hand, @CAPS5 someone were to be looking for and acception vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can be found as well. Some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive. One @MONTH1 have to take a plane or pay to take trips with relatives. Social networks on the web makes connecting with lvoe ones easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean. I hope that everything I have fare travel can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find way benefits to technological advances. Please do remember that technology can serve as a skill maintenance tool, educational resource, and as a connection for our foreign born citizens. Thank you for considering these points.
969	971	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 are big aguments about if computers are good or bad. I think that computers benifit our society. Why, because it makes socializeing easir, You can gain lots of education and also help with buisnesses. Wow, I cant believe how easy it it to ather people with computers. Computer are helping family chat with family and friends chat with freinds. It help peoples socialize by letting them send messages on paper that used to be forever to deliver and to get one back, also if family members go away on a vacation you can still contact them. Or simply if a friend cant get a ride to another friends house they on still talk on the computer. Also a computer gives you an oportunity to socialize with people all over the world. Its amazing how easy it is to talk with other people with the computer. I really astonishing how much education we have gained from using the computer. Computers have given us to many part to learn. Before computers you learned about things from books, And many of those books could not teach you as well as a computer does. With a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets. Also with computers you can learn about other nation. What @CAPS1 culture and landscapes are like without even being @CAPS1. Computers have truly played a vital role in our education. Computers have done lots of things but not as much stuff as the did for buisnessed. The computer itself was a busness and people model lots of money. It helped buisnessed organize @CAPS1 work and money also its given people lots of jobs working on computers. Also it gave buisnesses, quicker, more eficiant way to put up advertisements for people to by @CAPS1. Computers have played a vital role in creating our economy. Computers have made socialize long easer. The ability for us to get more education. Also it helps with our buisnesses This is why I think that computers have benifited our society in many important ways.
970	972	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper I'm writing a letter to you about how I feel about the effects that computers have on people. One of my reasons is that people that spend to much time on the computers they are litting their lifes pass by them. But the people that work on computers all day is a different thing. My second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other. My last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day. I'm not talking about the people that work on computer. My last reason is that the people that is spending all their time on the computer they are letting their lifes pass by there. The reason I say this is because if you are on the computer @NUM1 hours a day your life is passing by you. Because you are not doing nothing, just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat. Also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer. But I'm not talking about the people that work in computer all day long, because they have to do it. Its their job to. Thats one of my reasons. My second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family. The reasons I say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them, two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them. That's why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer. The last and final reason is do people to spend most of their lifes on the computer. The person I like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and don't go find a job go enjoy their life. Also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them, that, they had fun with them, and that they had somebody that they could look up too. So don't spend your life time on the computer geting fat, not spending time with their children and make something yourselfs. But I'm not talking about the people that workon computers. I'm talking about the people that don't work on computers. Thats why I said don't let youre life pass by you. i hope you liked the prompt and that you wont spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you. I'll report myself again I'm not talking about the people that have to work in the computer. I'm talking about the people that don't work in computers and should be living their lives more fully.
971	973	1	3	I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time on computers. In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business or work related tasks, which is a productive use of their time. But then again there are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day, often for many hours without a break. What they could be doing is enjoying life, engaging in physical activities and hobbies. Going outside and getting fresh air is beneficial for both physical and mental health. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer, often neglecting other aspects of their lives. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer; some people are constantly on their social websites, checking for updates and messages. Such as Facebook or Twitter. They are obsessed so those are two websites that are very addicting to some people, making it difficult to log off. and then these are the people who just like looking things up, falling into endless cycles of browsing. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there, your family and friends are more important. And use the computer only when you need to, for specific tasks and then step away. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment, like watching videos or reading articles. But all things are good in moderation, and this is especially true for computer use. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers and the importance of balance. So thank you for listening and considering this perspective.
972	974	1	3	What computers stop you from doing is your homework in school, as they can be a major distraction from your studies. But when you do something on the computer you're not supposed to do, like visiting non-educational sites, you get stuck on a website you can't get off your screen, falling into a trap of endless clicking. So what I'm trying to say is to don't stay on the computer for longer than just thirty minutes for leisure, as it can quickly consume your valuable time. It is important to manage your time wisely and prioritize your responsibilities over screen time, ensuring you complete your work first. By limiting your computer use, you can maintain a healthier balance between your digital and real-world activities, which is crucial for your overall well-being and academic success.
973	975	1	3	Computers are a common household item these days, found in nearly every home. Due to how much computers are able to do, from communication to information retrieval, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society by reducing face-to-face interactions. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic quickly and efficiently, but some people take it too far and rely on them for everything. Some people, their jobs are on computers, requiring them to be seated at a desk for the entire workday. Others like teenagers will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities and physical exercise. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch, making it more accessible and dangerous. Computers can also keep you in from outside, preventing you from getting fresh air and sunlight which are vital for health. Computers are bad in some ways but good in others, depending entirely on how they are used. Sometimes computers are a perfect resource for students and professionals alike. When your history teacher assigns you a five page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happened in the civil war, a computer can provide the necessary research. In this case computers are good, as they offer a vast library of information. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones, a task perfectly suited for online databases. Computers seem like a perfect resource for such specific queries. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book, fostering a more active and well-rounded lifestyle. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I believe, that a lot of things would be different in our society today, with people being more present and engaged with the world around them.
974	976	1	3	Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my opinion can help your decision. I think that computers are good for a number of important reasons. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world, connecting them to global events. First of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills, especially those who are shy or have difficulty communicating in person. They help them because there is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer, such as email and social media platforms. There is instant messaging and webcaming websites which allow for real-time conversation. Also a survey said that seventy percent of parents say that the computer raised their kids social skills a lot, giving them more confidence. Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting, which can be a significant barrier. It helps because you can go on Microsoft Word and instead of writing a great report that no one can read you can type it out clearly. I know that when I have a paper for school that neatness counts on I always type up my report to ensure a good grade. This can help a lot of people who can't write as well as others because on the computer you can change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want, creating a professional appearance. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is because a lot of people don't like to read newspapers and watch the news so they like to research certain subjects they like, to know what's going on around the world from sources they trust. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the news or the newspaper but when she checks her email the first thing that pops up is the biggest news of the day, keeping her informed efficiently. People all around the world go to the computer to find out the latest news, from political events to weather updates. I hope you consider my opinion when you make your decision, where you will think of all the kinds of people it helps, from children to professionals. People with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who can't sit down and watch the hour news benefit greatly from computer technology. Thank you for your time and for reading my letter.
975	977	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, my opinion is yes people are on the computer too much. I have three good reasons why I think people are on the computer a lot and why it is a problem. My first reason is people are losing valuable time that they can never get back. Second, they are not getting that much energy from being sedentary. Third, you are just spending your life on the computer; keep on reading why I don't agree that it benefits society for people to be online so frequently. People are losing time to have real fun and create lasting memories. They don't have any time for friends, family, pets, and such more important parts of life. It is mostly an addiction to go on websites like Facebook, Myspace, YouTube, and such more; people just need to get off the computer and have fun outside in the real world. Mostly people don't really get that much energy from sitting still all day. Some people are always inside they just need energy, which comes from movement and activity. Fresh air will help that, maybe by going to the gym or going for a jog outside for a while to get the blood flowing. Being inside isn't really good for you, as it can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Just being inside just makes you kinda gain weight from lack of exercise. And then you wouldn't have any time with your friends, and more only if you're inside like always, missing out on social connections. Finally, you spend all your time at home being on the computer, which is a waste of your one precious life. And you don't have any time, energy and such more for other pursuits. You spend all your time inside with cool computer technology but you don't need to be on it all day and night. You just need to make time for friends and family, who provide genuine support and happiness. Now you know my opinion why computers are not a benefit to society when overused. People are losing time and everything that makes life meaningful. People don't have anymore energy to live actively. And you spend all your time on the computer instead of living fully. Bye for now, and I hope you consider this viewpoint.
976	978	1	3	"Dear Readers, Can you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your town, or even failing tests because you didn’t have a computer? I know I couldn’t. Some of the great benefits of having a computer are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able to study for school and tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now possible with the computer. Facts show that a large percentage of families in the country have distant friends with internet access, now all of these people can talk to each other! I'll never forget the time that my close friends moved, but I was still able to talk to him because of the computer. Second, the computer allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have known about some of the places I've been to if it wasn't for the computer. A leading organization stated that the computer expert Dr. Smith says ""Computers are the reason we have so much information; without computers we wouldn't know about these places."" Furthermore, it is now possible to study without leaving home because of the computer. Homework can be done on the internet online. I'll never forget the time that I forgot my book, but I could still study because of the online book. In conclusion the computer has many benefits to you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. Computers are just full of all-around benefits."
977	979	1	3	"To whom it may concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out to exercise, or to enjoy nature. Perhaps the worst effect is that hardly anyone interacts with their friends and family anymore. Surely you don't want to succumb to the computers. Put down the mouse and go outside! Obesity in our nation is at an all time high. Experts agree that computers and other types of technology are to blame. People who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that affects them negatively. These people have a shorter lifespan! They might not be around in twenty years to see their grandchildren grown up. Also, they have many medical problems. Dr. Evans, an obesity expert, says, ""I have seen a positive correlation with the obesity rate and that of computer usage."" Computer addiction can kill you! Obesity can also cause heart attacks and infertility! Since you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? Using the computer is not a good price to pay for your health! Do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature? I know I do. Most people who spend too much time on the computer don't get the chance to make memories like that. They're too preoccupied with the computer to care. Many people won't ever see any of our national parks! Drew Johnson, a park ranger, says, ""In the past few years, we have had less visitors than ever before."" If people can't tear themselves away from the computer for even a minute to see the splendor of our national parks, there is obviously something wrong. Get off your computers and go outside! I share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible. Almost all people who use the computer often say a significant percentage of the time, they use it as an excuse not to see friends and family. In reality, they don't want to leave it. As a society, we are becoming too dependent on technology. A community supervisor says, ""I have seen a definite decline in family enrollment. We hardly ever see kids with friends and family hanging around"". She is right. Now is the time to stop using computers! Computers may not be totally to blame for the problems stated above. Maybe it's the people, though computers do contribute to the problem. If we didn't have computers, there would be more people out exercising, and enjoying nature. Memories would be made when we hung around with friends and family. Now is the time to turn off the computer, and go outside. Call up a friend and take a stroll, and you will know you can have fun without computers."
978	980	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, People spend too much time on the computer. Instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with real people they sit down and play games and watch music or movies on the computer. Therefore I do not agree with people who say computers benefit society. Our community, our towns, our cities. A lot of people's skin is jiggly and fat because of computers. Why, you may ask? People sit in front of their computers all day when they could spend that time exercising. My dad got extremely overweight when we got a new computer. All he did was sit and play games like Space Wars or Dragon Quest. I couldn't believe how fat he got so my mom told him and now instead of playing on the computer he goes to the gym. You wouldn't believe how much weight he lost. Also did you know that America is one of the fattest countries because people don't exercise and just play on their laptops and computers. So it would help America a lot to stop playing software and start exercising. So many people miss out on the beautiful works of nature. The cool relaxing air at the beach is much nicer than a dark stuffy room with just the glow of a computer. There's so much to discover, so much to be explored. So yes you could find the geysers in Yellowstone online but it's nothing like seeing it in real life. If there were computers back in the early 1800s people would never had the urge to find new land; you don't hear of many great explorers now do you? I bet if everyone took a break from computers new species would be found or maybe even a cure for cancer. Who knows what you can do if you step out of the box and into the beautiful part of nature. ""Please come down and talk to your grandparents."" ""Not now mom I'm playing on the computer!"" How many times has this happened to you? Has your son or daughter been on the computer when great Aunt Marie has been over? They might have wanted to play on the computer then but they don't know if that could have been their last day with him or her. Computers will be here forever or almost forever, people's time is limited. Therefore hanging out with a relative is much more important than playing on the computer. I know a kid named Billy who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over. Billy said no. His friend was so disappointed and angry. I would be too. Would you like to have a friend pick a computer over you? I'd hope not. Therefore computers hurt and are not as good as real people. In conclusion quality time with people, nature, and exercise is more important than a glowing box. I hope you agree that computers do not always help society."
979	981	1	3	Dear newspaper, I don't think that computers benefit our society. I don’t believe that computers can be dangerous; they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer. One reason why I don’t think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous. Computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or harassed. The town of Springfield police department says that over half of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as Myspace and Facebook. The police chief also says that there are many cases about people being harassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them. Another reason why I don't think computers benefit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer. A shocking number of people say that they have lost large amounts of money due to credit card scams on the computer. On computers there are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them and they will take your card and buy things with it and you will have to pay for it. Credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer. The final reason why I don't believe that computers benefit us is because they make people lazy. Computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games and you can watch videos and you could shop and you could see just about anything on a computer. I did some research and found that a majority of people that are over weight have accounts on multiple sites on computers. These are the reasons why I don't think computers benefit us. I hope you too heed to my advice and consider the risks involved with excessive computer use.
980	982	1	3	"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on what's happening around the world. First, I believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you always wanted to know, like, French, or Japanese, or even Russian if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of Japanese"", and listen to what it tells you about Japanese! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on what's happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on TVs because computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the videos, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an end. Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the what's happening around the world. Wouldn't you want to uphold those amazing events also?"
981	983	1	3	The computer is a good way to contact family and friends. People send messages all over the world or just to the person next door. People enjoy playing video games or browsing websites that they like. People all over the world buy laptops to travel from one place to another. Not everybody is on a computer because they think it's not good to have, but some people do like to have one for sending messages, hanging out with one another, or talking about how their day was. Many people want a computer but do not have enough money to buy one. Some computers cost a lot of money, like several hundred dollars, or even more than a thousand; it depends which one they get. Around the world, many people sell their old computers to get money to buy different stuff like shoes, clothes, or new games. They often sell stuff on eBay to get less or more money, but they can't take the computer back to the store to get a refund or a new one. People sometimes want the classic computers, but now companies come out with new ones like touch screen models. Many people have been buying them at major electronics retailers or online stores. Every time the new computers come out, people buy a lot, and the company makes a lot of money from selling the touch screen computers. Every new year the company makes new computers so they can get thousands of dollars. Companies all over the world make different computers to bring out new styles so people will like them and purchase them. The newer the styles, the more money they make. Some people start their own companies to get money like the other companies do, but some of the money you make goes to the government. The money given to the government is used to take care of homeless people. Computers are used for learning or for fun. People sometimes share computers with others; they cannot always share because it wouldn't be fair, so some people take turns using it. Some people do not like taking turns with one another. Everybody must share or have their own, and they can use it or not, but they can't force their server if somebody else wants to get on the internet. Some people lie and say they were getting on it. People like joking around with others. Parents always say a computer is not a toy to play with; computers cost a lot to repair, and when people spill water on them, the computer messes up. The people get mad, especially if he or she just got a new computer. When computers first came out, people bought them to see what they would be like. Many people liked them, and they became popular all over the world; people were talking about them, and the company made more and more until they were in stores everywhere. The computer got famous, and the company made newer styles for everyone else. People bought a lot of computers every time a new style came out. Many people had one or two at home as they collected them. Companies made other companies mad because they were making better styles. People were ordering online to get new computers, and the company that makes them is making a lot of money. One company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that was the best one ever. When they came up with one, the other company was mad that they made a better one. Some companies even joined together to make one computer collaboratively.
982	984	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I agree that computers benefit us totally. This technology lets people explore the world and do almost anything. Also, computers are used for many things in daily life. Last but not least, a significant number out of every ten households have at least one computer. So computers let us do anything and everything we need. It helps most people with their jobs, college or school work, and you can even buy a house or a car online. It doesn't cost that much for the value it provides, and it's very useful. You can look up facts you need for research or even play games when you're bored. It keeps us in touch with the world and current events. Also, many modern activities require a computer. For example, in order to play Xbox Live you need a computer with an internet connection. Xbox Live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends online. Some homework assignments require computers, and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home and learn. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. Statistics show that a high percentage of households have computers, or a large portion of the population does. I agree that some people waste their time on them, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to send a document; instead of having to wait five days for the mail, you can just e-mail it instantly. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers in their workplace. It saves people's time and lets them do other things instead of having to drive somewhere to give a letter to someone. So I think computers are a huge benefit to society. Like I said, you can do anything, like shopping or communicating. It keeps you in touch with friends if you're on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your portable device. Also, it seems like everyone has a computer today. If scientists are going to complain about computers, then why do they use them for their research? I think computers are great and essential tools for modern life, but what is your opinion on this matter?
983	985	1	3	"Dear Editor, ""Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me, I can't live without a computer,"" said many local residents in the town of our community. For me, computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications available. But they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine, from history to science. I also think that the computer is important because it is where businessmen do their job and manage their work. My favorite part about the computer are applications like social media sites, communication platforms, and entertainment portals, and so many more. These apps are great because on a messaging app, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state. Social media is easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and so many other endless possibilities. You can also play and download games onto your computer for entertainment. It's always very fun to do things on the computer that you enjoy, and not have to research all the time. The second important thing on the computer is research. Researching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, but researching is educational. I asked a mother with a young child, a pre-teen, and a teenager and she said, ""The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. It's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The best thing about researching is that there are endless amounts of websites that have information for us to look at and learn from. People that work and have jobs are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them are researching while working. People that work are the ones that are basically on the computer all day. Businessmen, designers, etc., use them constantly. The computers are mostly used by workers for e-mail communication. My father is always on the computer, checking e-mails, typing something for his boss, and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because for some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, are one of the best things ever created. They are the best because they have amazing apps for me to have fun on, but they also provide an educational opportunity through research, and they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person in the modern world that can live without one of these technological beauties."
984	986	1	3	Dear local newspaper, a survey shows that a majority of students at the local high school say that they spend most of their free time on the computer. I think computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues, health issues, and of course education issues. With all this new technology, teenagers aren't aware of their surroundings at all when they are focused on the screen. On top of that, they're not aware of what's happening to them in the real world. Adults also use the computer, but not as frequently as us teenagers. It's time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today. Computers can cause serious safety issues. Now more than ever people use social media where they talk to friends. But, what they don't know is that the person on the other side might not be who they think it is. Lately, on the news we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because the people they were talking to on the internet were not who they said they were. Bad people are always lurking on the internet, and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with kids. But, even besides having bad people online, computers can interfere with your privacy. It's possible for computers to give out your personal information to other people, so we really need to watch out what we share. Computers though not only cause safety issues, but health issues also. Computers play a major part in destroying our health. About a large percentage of children are now overweight or obese. TVs used to be the issue for people not exercising, but now computers are doing just the same. There are so many things to do on the computer that just don't make you bored, so there is no reason to get away from it. But, you need to get up and exercise, and computers are preventing people from doing so. It's like they are hypnotizing us because we simply don't want to get up from the chair. Computers can also have an impact on your vision. I know that after a long time on the computer I have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad. Also, computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally. Talking and interacting in person makes us have safe relationships with one another, but computers again are preventing this. Besides interfering with our health, computers do the same with education. Computers can really be bad for our education. Students now easily forget to do homework. There are so many distractions today that when people spend a long time on it, we forget to do other things that we're supposed to do simply because we're distracted. But, even though we forget our homework, we also sometimes forget to study before a test. This would result in a drop in high grades. Computers shouldn't be distracting people, but instead helping them with schoolwork. I think it's not entirely the people's fault for getting distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features. For example, the internet, and websites like social networks, video sites, and games, etc. We have so many distractions in our lives that we don't need more from technology! Computers really don't have a good effect on people overall. More and more people get computers everyday. They should know what it's doing to them, and what's happening to the world around them. Why not go outside and enjoy nature? Maybe, go to the mall with friends and socialize. There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day. People need to stop being so dependent on technology and open their eyes to see the negative effect computers have on people's lives.
985	987	1	3	Dear Editor, I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on computer use. In my opinion, I think that some people use and rely on computers too much. Whether it be for a research project, talking to friends, and even finding answers for homework, the dependence is clear. Everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight without a break. Moving your fingers doesn't count as exercise, and it wastes electricity and time. Many people I know would be lost if they didn't have a computer because their friends are online or they need it for homework assistance. These type of people need to be taught how to get things done without technology because one day it might fail them. Some students rely on their technology to work or they will fail their assignments. These children need to be taught that there are other ways to do things, like hanging out with friends in person, reading a book from the library, and even doing their homework with pen and paper. Since students rely on their computers so much, they are always on them. Every day people I know go home from school and jump on a popular online platform for the rest of the day. They never seem to do anything else, like going outside and doing sports. Many kids do not do any type of athletic sport anymore. Obesity is a huge problem in our area, and the numbers keep increasing drastically. Everyone thinks that it is being caused by bad eating habits, but that's only half of it. People overusing their computer is also a big part of the problem. Children around the neighborhood are stuck on their computers all day checking messages and setting up profile pictures. While these children are on the computer, they don't even think; they just chow down on unhealthy snacks. This computer usage problem is beginning to become a big deal with the obesity rates and how much people rely on it for basically everything in their lives. So we need to be the first people to stop this before it forms a bad habit that is hard to break. This could be a huge problem in the future if not addressed. So let's start to cut our usage time down now for a healthier lifestyle.
986	988	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family, and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing. For instance, you could ride your bike or even walk the dog; exercising in @MONTH1 can be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well doesn't mean you're healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, swim, walk the dog, or go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time you're on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Let's say your family is going to the beach, but you stay home to play games on Facebook. Your family comes back and talks about all the fun they had, even though you weren't there. You could have been a part of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. It's movie night, and all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot of fun and bonding. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, and you learn about different types of literature. Over all, reading books makes you smarter and more informed. When you're reading online you often just read what people say, which is basically rumors and unverified information. You should READ more books! In conclusion, I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends, and reading instead of being on computers, as these activities contribute to a healthier and more fulfilling life.
987	989	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, In today's age computers are seen everywhere and they have been so helpful. They act as an information highway and connect people together. The new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over. First off, computers are an easy way to have a universe of information at your fingertips. @PERCENT1 of students at @ORGANIZATION2 say that when assigned a report or project the first source they use is from the internet. The internet is fast, simple and reliable when you know how to use it properly,"" said student @PERSON1. Children from the age of @NUM1 and up are learning how to use the internet's multiple online encyclopedias, magazines, news sites, and other resources to get information. I remember my kindergarten computer class where we'd research dinosaurs and weather patterns on kid friendly websites. And now being in middle school we use websites like @CAPS1 Online for up to date reliable information for our schoolwork. Moreover, I've seen my mom, a nurse and hospital manager, use the internet for instructional videos and medical articles on how to do certain procedures and ways to organize a productive hospital. The internet is a great way to have a highway of information at the touch of a button. Furthermore, computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch. @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they talk to other peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 or @CAPS5. Its a great way for us to communicate with our busy schedules when we can't always get together in person. Also with parents losing jobs in this economic downfall, kids are always moving. Last @DATE1 one of my best friends in the world moved all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought we'd never talk again and I was so upset to say goodbye, but because of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 we talk non-stop and have actually never been closer. And its not just for young people to fool around with friends but adults use social networks too. They connect for business through the internet and talk about future deals or problems and even use it to connect with old friends they haven't spoken to since college or childhood. As you can see the internet has had many positive effects from doing research faster to connecting with old friends, computers are helping everyone stay informed and connected in our modern world."
988	990	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe the computer does have positive perks, but it also has negative perks. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you then forget to exercise. Reason three, your health is in jeopardy. Firstly, you loose interaction with family and friends because you would spend so much time on the computers. It ruins your marriage if you are married, creating distance between partners. If you have kids you risk your relationship with them, as they may feel neglected. I am not saying to stop using computers completely, because I use them myself. I am saying don't make your life the computer; it's not good for you! Secondly, you need exercise. Statistics show @PERCENT1 of the people who live on their computers gain weight faster. I would know because as a @NUM1 yr old I have gained a little weight because of computers. Most people when on the computer tend to eat more; snacks like @CAPS1 are all well-known facts that have been proven. Since you can't walk with a computer in hand, you stop moving, meaning you stop exercising regularly. You have to limit your time and then there is where I believe they (computers) benefit you. Lastly, your health is very much at stake. If you are at the computer for @NUM2 hours at a time your eye-site will pay the price. My eyes stink when I am on the computer for half an hour. Doesn't your head hurt when you are on the computer for so long? Yes, the computer is fun and it gives you things to do, I am the first one to admit that. But, it also hurts your health. For being on the computer for so long you are at risk for carpal tunnel syndrome, which is very painful and can affect your wrists. Computers are so much fun and make life easier in many ways. But, they have disadvantages. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you stop exercising. Reason three your health is at risk. If you limit your time on the computer, everything will be alright and you can enjoy the benefits without the major drawbacks!
989	991	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 my name is @PERSON1 and I am writing to you because, I want to inform you about the benefits of having computers. I think that having computers is a great way for kids like me to learn more about things in the world, from history to science. Having a computer also helps people in need by connecting them to vital resources and also informs people about far away places in the the world that they might never visit. I believe if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't really know that much about our world and its diverse cultures. Computers also help us to send emergency messages across the world in @NUM1, allowing for quick help and coordination during crises. Some people do not think that computers have an effect on our society but I for one think computers have a very positive effect on people and how we communicate. People also think that computers make people spend less time exercising, but I believe that it actually helps people to exercise because you can go online and find different exercising techniques and follow along with video guides. In conclusion, I think that computers have a positive effect on society by providing educational resources, connecting people globally, and even promoting health and fitness through accessible information.
990	992	1	3	Computers are good to use because they tell you everything you might need to know. Like if you need a phone number to a restaurant you can just get it off the computer quickly and easily. Sometimes when you wanna go on a vacation and if you wanna know how much it cost you can go onto the computer and find the best deals. And computers are good because if you wanna travel to different places you can go onto the computer and look for a map and print it out for your journey. But sometimes computers are bad because when people go on web sites to chat, people can be grown ups but they are talking to little kids, which can be very dangerous and misleading. It is important to be careful and use computers wisely to enjoy their benefits while avoiding these potential risks.
991	993	1	3	"Have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts are concerned that people are using too much time on the computers. I believe we should still use computers. Without a doubt using a computer helps us learn. The computer helps us learn about other places in the world through virtual tours and educational websites. @PERCENT1 of people say they would love to look at beautiful places in the world. Computers also can teach you how to speak a language with interactive software and online courses. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that ""taking spanish online helped im a lot on her class. Computers now offer online study groups that can help us get into a college by preparing for entrance exams. Many people would agree that using a computer helps us learn new things. Its a fact that you instead other people on computers. You meet new people when you are in the computer through social media and online forums. Most people live meeting other people online. You also learn social on the computer by interacting in digital communities. @PERCENT2 of people say they learn social on the computer. People also can learn to have a personality because they in use, gaining confidence in online interactions. @PERSON2 says that ""because I got on the computer I didn't have the personality but I feel like a whole person. As you interact with people on the computers, you develop communication skills. Did you know that a computer teacher in life say if you need to use a computer in your will one already. @PERSON3 says that using a computer helped you type faster and more accurately. Using a computer helped hand eye coordination through using the mouse and keyboard. You type a lot of essays in college too os that can help you as well with your future career. So now you know that a computer helps you in the future with many essential skills. Without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways for education and social growth. So what are you waiting for go out and go your computer today!"
992	994	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Have you even been on a computer too long & haven't spent time excersising, or haven't spent any time with your family? Well, that's a big problem here in the @LOCATION1. In my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain amount @ORGANIZATION1 time & after they enjoy themselves with a nice workout, time outside & most importantly with their families. I think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school & shooting right to wherever your computer is & being on it for the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the night. I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades by creating time for homework. If your on computer all the time & don't have any time to excersise, go outside, and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. By not doing homework, your grades could go lower & you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. This one problem ran also affect you so many other ways, like your health and relationships. The problem with computers & why people, mostly kids are so attached with them is because @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as twitter, facebook, youtube, etc. & kids are @CAPS1 to them. This is part @ORGANIZATION1 the problem because kids can't get off @ORGANIZATION1 them, they like it so much. This problem leads to the main problem because if parents say ""Time to get off... go get some fresh air."" the kid always goes ""one minute"" & the parents let them get away with that, but then that ""one minute"" turns into an hour at most. This is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, its dark out and they can't go run around outside. I think this is important because think that facebook & twitter should be limited amount @ORGANIZATION1 time and should log you off after @NUM1 minutes to encourage a break. In conclusion, this problem is a national issue & in my opinion should be a new law, that kids have to play outside, and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. As you can see having all these great websites leads into a problem with kids becoming too dependent on them. Thanks for your time on reading why I think computers are a big problem here in the @ORGANIZATION1."
993	995	1	3	I think computers are good, because some people dont have phones so @CAPS1 a good way to conect with people you know, also meet new people through social networks. Second some people are going to collage when there done with high school so you could just look on the computers and find one you like and pricess, also find ways there by researching campuses and programs online. Third reason is ahopping if a holiday is coming up you could check online and find stuff for cheap and nice to you, comparing prices easily. You could also order it to your house online if you dont got alot of time to go shopping, making it very convenient. @CAPS1 some reasons why I think online is good you could chat, find places and pricess, collages and also shop online @CAPS1 why online is good for modern life.
994	996	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 I heard a lot of people are spending to much time in the computers and less time exercising, enjoying the nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion I think you should know the compouter because it helps for school homework or projects, talking to family far away and finding new friends. My first reason why we should keep computers is because it @MONTH1 help on school homework or projects. This is my top reason because its really helpful and its useful when you need it also if your computer its not working you can go to your friends house and use computers, when your done you can save on hardrive and print it in your school's computers for your assignments. My segond reason why you should keeps computer is talking to family. Without the computer you can't communicate with family easily, especially if they live far away. In my opinion computers are very helpful to cummnicate with family. If your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family through email or video calls. My third reason is communicating and find new friends without the who are you going to meet and communicate with you can communicate with your family throught the computer, or even if your running late you can send them a message through the computer quickly. In my opinion I think the computer its a really good way to communicate with your family and stay connected. I know that people say they spend to much time in the computers and its addicting, but its good for school work like projects and assignments, also people said its just to what on the but in my opinion we should keep computers because its no to see whats on the other person, it's for useful tasks. Its to do school work and talk to family, which are important activities. I know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not a problem when used responsibly. In my opinion, we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family, which are essential parts of life. I think what you should do its not get rid off computers but learn to use them in a balanced way.
995	997	1	3	"Many families across the globe use computers, whether their from @LOCATION1, all the way to the deserts of @LOCATION2. However, believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise, In @CAPS21 perspective. I can agree, with there, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computer on @CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?"" that is where students can got their @CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer from home. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online from the comfort of your house. There are many shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1 which offer great deals. Furthermore, many shops like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a catolog online, where you and effenly browse products. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9) for staying in touch. Webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and @CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily, help maintain relationships. These are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy and daily life. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many @CAPS16 you can play, like @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14-@CAPS15 @CAPS16) for fun. I play many of these, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17 in my free time. I love these @CAPS16 because they are very amusing world to explore. You watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via @CAPS18 for enjoyment. @CAPS18 is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see, sharing experiences. A @CAPS18 video is ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22,"" a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother, showing viral content. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored at home. I can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day for balance. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @CAPS16 called @CAPS23 for education. With this, you can play many fun @CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science and other subjects. In @CAPS21 science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motion/gravity effectively. You can also conduct research on the web, you with many projects for school or work. I know I use the web to with almost every project I have, finding valuable information quickly."
996	998	1	3	"Imagine your life without the benefits of the computer. Do you think it would make life a little harder? Computers have positive effects on people for educational reasons and for a new way to develop communication skills. Technology is very important to our society. Computers can help with our educational needs. When a school project is going on more than ninety percent of students use a computer to access the information they need. I agree that students depend too much on a computer and not on books, but the computer has more information to offer than the average book. The computer indeed lets us, as students, to broaden our horizon. The study stated that ""a near eighty percent of students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know."" For example, in history and geography class a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book. I predict that as a result of the informational access the computer gives us, that soon grades will boost at least ten to fifteen percent. In a survey that was done by the National Education Association, found that seventy-five percent of students found more information, that was relevant, on a selected topic than in the whole school library. Next, the computer can help with hand-eye coordination for young kids. In school students are observed to see how well or if their coordination is being developed. With fifteen percent of students having very little coordination, computer games lowered the percentage to ten. The computer does help with the educational needs of students in our community. The computer is a great way to socialize with friends. It is a new and inventive way to communicate. I know that some critics say that there is less time spent humanly interacting, but on the computer it is still interacting. With a phone you can only chat with each other, but a computer has a webcam. This device allows you to talk to people with some human interaction. Around fifty to sixty million users have this device to use. It often is preinstalled into many Dell and Apple laptops, giving us portable access to talk. CEO at Dell said that ""since the laptops have come with a built in web cam, one out of every two that have it installed use it to chat socially and for business."" The computer can help with our communications for personal or business needs. The computer is a good way to start and develop with communication skills. More than half of children use a computer to start with the beginnings of their communication skills. Computer allow many people to become connected with each other in new and effective ways. In conclusion, the average computer can benefit our lives in positive ways. From our educational needs and to our communication needs, the computer positively affects us in these two very important ways."
997	999	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Imagine your life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would surely be a hassle. The question of whether or not computers are beneficial to society has risen in the media, where they argue that people spend less time exercising, interacting with nature, and less time with their family. However, computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have drastically helped out educationally at school, not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family. Also computers have so many different forms of entertainment. Computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society. Firstly, computers have helped academically in our schools and at home. I can't even imagine the hassle of coming home with the assignment or writing two essays, only to have to write it by hand! Wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush, resulting in a bad grade. Also, think of the handwriting factor. Most kids in my school don't have good handwriting, and I am assuming that teachers have a hard time grading something they can't read. With programs such as Microsoft Word, you are given the option of different fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so on. Another way computers have helped academically is in schools. More and more teachers are using computers to help us learn. Tests are taken on computers, websites to help us research are visited, and other Microsoft program such as PowerPoint can be used for a project. Computers help a lot in school, while helping us learn so much more. Computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family. The days of short letters are replaced with long emails with pictures attached, sent in a matter of seconds whizzing through the internet only to arrive on your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead having them stored on their computer, ready to print onto bond paper. There are advances in communication through computers that have been made. Things such as video chat where you can literally see and talk to the other person, or just audio chat where you can talk to the person, have been made. Such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch. Computers have made a positive impact on community by having simple ways to talk to your loved ones. Computers can also provide a fun source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, find people from your past, or maybe just look out funny videos. Anything you type into your toolbar instantly transforms into a page of links websites where you can find details on your topic, or relative things. One fun website is that of 'YouTube'. This website lets people upload videos. The possibilities are endless on the web. Another fun website is 'Facebook'. This website is where you can 'friend' people you know from the past and interact with them. You can post videos, write messages and such. As you can see, entertainment is everywhere on the web. The time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. Computers are a benefit to modern day society because they help academically, encourage you to stay in touch with family and friend, and provide entertainment. We should all understand that computers are a huge advance in science, and they are a great help, and also fun!
998	1000	1	3	"The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one, and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced, not feared and avoided. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. Besides, for personal usage, computers are highly beneficial. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers it radiates, which really isn't reasonable, when analyzed closely. To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational, the computer is the future plain and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that, paint the picture of the future of our world. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate pollution margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and water. Our nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to modern technology, or we will fall behind and watch our environment slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever-growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumstances, such as an occurrence in a workplace causing the area to be off-limits. A member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accident and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing them the trouble of a commute to work. Even from home to office, with simply the press of ""send"", people across the world can be informed of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information, is so easy with a search engine. Where would we be without computers to find information rapidly? We would be still going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer. Even a person opposed to computers would have to admit that to be highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows ""good"" websites to be viewed, and ""bad"" or potentially dangerous sites to be blocked. This eliminates all that is heard about on-line interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only one out of a hundred websites, includes content considered ""detrimental"" to humans. Also, of those hundred, ninety-five provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminated, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of personal computers are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable, and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear of computers. We have come so far to create such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device, we must put it to use, and by doing so, better our own lives, and the life of our planet."
999	1001	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think people should use computers for specific reasons. One reason is that many people lose family or to be more specific lose contact with people. Then when you have a computer or someone else has one then you would be able to see them. For other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers. Plus your fingers get a exercise when you're typing. Many of us young kids say that Myspace and Facebook is a bad place. Actually its not because most of your family is on it. Doctors use computers all the time to notify other doctors that something wrong with a patient or give a visual of the breathing. Workers even use it to see whats going on with the jobs if there are any jobs open so they can take it. Students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers not there. If I was a carpenter or a real estate agent I would have a computer with me. The reason why is that my group would know what houses are available to use or that are sold. Or I would give them different house to choose from and give them a good deal on it. I would also bring a computer with me for GPS so I can know where I am. Many people use computers for different reason. Such as programs, cheatcodes, greeting cards and other thing. My reason for using this is because my work is important to me. I would do it on the computers if I miss it. That is why you should have computers all the time. You never know what would happen. In conclusion, This is why computers are very important to have. The reasons are for if something happens to you and you don't have a phone use a computer. Also its beneficial that everyone has thing to do but computers are the best thing to do.
1000	1002	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instantly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great but they can also have negative effects on us too. I like computers but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers it's like they're in another world. When you're on the computer you are a lot less social than you would be if you not on the computer. I don't know about you but a lot of people are addicted to their computers. They get on and they stay on forever. They act like it is a necessity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like Facebook and here is why. Computers get really annoying sometimes. They distract people a lot. Like the other day my sister and I were going to go walking but we didn't go because she wouldn't get off the computer to help us exercise so we shouldn't be using it. In this economy it is important to have social skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are gaining social skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer to long I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eye sight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They may not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long. These were some reason why you should not use the computer. I am not saying that it is an evil contraption I'm just saying, use the computer for info and work not for games and other things. You could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out! Go make some real breathing friends in person.
1001	1003	1	3	Dear Newspaper, People should play with their family and friends instead of staying on the computer all the time. People would be more fit, have closer bonds with their family, and get better grades in school. People will always get fit faster if they exercise instead of staying on the computer, engaging in physical activities like running or playing sports. When the computer is unplugged, anyone has a chance to go outside and play. When people go outside to play with their friends, they exercise which causes you to lose weight and build stronger muscles. Many scientists believe that it is better to go outside and socialize than to sit on a computer and watch monotonous videos. People would be more active if they stayed off the computer and went outside because it will keep you happy with your body, and healthy so you don't die of a terrible diseases. There would be closer bonds with families if people stayed off the computer. Family would be closer together instead of spreading apart by computers, sharing conversations and experiences. Your family is always there to comfort you whenever you have a terrible day. Your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward. If you did this by computer, all you see is a persons face who can't comfort you with a hug or a reassuring touch. Without computers, you get a closer family that loves and supports each other, but with computers, people just drive their families away. Closer families also help children in school get better grades. Families who stay off the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades, as they can discuss their school day. Many scientists agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school. If kids get better grades in school from staying off the computer and spending quality time with their family, we could get great inventions that can help mankind in every single way. All of this can happen from staying off of computers. Staying off computer is a great way to help yourself and other people to. It would get people fit, create closer bonds, and create more graduates who go on and achieve the greatest of all inventions. Imagine what else could happen by staying off computers, a healthier and more connected society for everyone.
1002	1004	1	3	Dear Editor, Many people have computers in their household but they disagree that a computer can help you. There are some advantages in using computers such as being able to search for information quickly, being able to learn hand-eye coordination through various games, and becoming organized with digital calendars and files, but it also has its disadvantages like children spending more time on the computer rather than going outside and playing with friends and exercising and staying fit. I agree that computers do produce a positive impact on children. Computers not only let a child stay in contact with their family that live faraway through video calls but it can also help them get a project done more efficiently and quickly, using software for research and presentation. It may seem that we are doing one thing but when in fact we can be uploading pictures and movies, downloading music and playing games at the same time, demonstrating the computer's ability to multitask. Now with all that I have told you today, I hope that we share the same point of views on computers like how they are good to have and their positive impact on our daily lives and learning.
1003	1005	1	3	"Dear The Daily Times, Experts say that computers are ""taking over people"", I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people to communicate to family and friends, too. Also, many people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also many things on the computer. You can learn about other countries and their cultures, you can read articles on news, also from around the globe. You can learn different languages and about the world, accessing online courses and educational videos. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam to see each other. there is also instant messenger, or chat applications. These applications are like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments instantly. Many people use computers for work. Microsoft Word allows you to type stories and type letters professionally. Many people do job reports on Word, creating documents and spreadsheets. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot with finding data. Websites can contain information that working people need for their projects and presentations. To finish this letter, I want to say that computers allow people to learn new skills and information. They allow people to communicate with friends and family across distances. Lastly, many working people use the computer for work and reports, making their tasks more efficient. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad but are useful tools in our modern world."
1004	1006	1	3	"I strolled into my bedroom, I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk. I thought that computers are very helpful. There are many controversies on whether computers benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. For instance, this year I had a science project about how my hobbies and interests are related to science. One of my interests is reading, so I had to research about how reading a simple book can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results came up. I had even gotten some pictures too to use in my presentation. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I received it back. I had gotten a high grade on this project! Clearly, being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to get an A on this. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend Sarah had moved away to another state. I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people. Both of us had been using this and we've been able to talk for hours on end. I don't see Sarah as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help re-establish old relationships with friends and family, keeping those connections alive. Furthermore, communicating on these platforms are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, ""Study Island."" Study Island involves you playing games that help you learn, and tests when you are ready to take them. Study Island has been helping us practice for the state exams. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the state exams and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of Study Island on the computer can benefit your school grades and test preparation. The effect computers have on people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge and connect you to the world. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers for their numerous advantages in education and communication."
1005	1007	1	3	Dear School Board, Computers these days have made positive changes to all of our every day lives. People have made better connections with family and friends, and even have the ability to make new ones through online platforms. While social networks are great and all, computers can also make work extremely easy and professional-looking, allowing for polished documents and presentations. They can also perfect the skill of hand-eye coordination through interactive games and applications. But with that in mind, is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are. Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as Facebook. I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made, and friends have been reunited after years apart. And besides reuniting friends, you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button, joining groups with shared interests. Isn't making more friends and reconnecting so easy now? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from Microsoft that can make making slideshows, projects, and reports far easier and more visually appealing. I remember making a slideshow with my best friend back when we were in fifth grade. All we did was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then we added captions and transitions to all of the pictures. We did an amazing, professional job on the project and received an A- for our efforts. Though I understand that in the process of computer-usage, people hardly find time outdoors, the technological advance will enhance hand-eye coordination, a skill useful in many areas. Imagine this: You're up at bat in a baseball game. Two strikes and three balls is your count. Everyone is cheering you on. The pitcher pitches the ball and wham! You swing that bat and hit yourself a homerun! Do you know what skill was used to hit that ball? That's right - hand-eye coordination, which can be improved by using the computer. So now while everyone is wondering what sort of effect the computer has, remember how easy that work was for me and the high grade we achieved. Also think back to that baseball player. You know, the one that hit the homerun using hand-eye coordination that might have been sharpened by computer games. But most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you, no matter the distance. The computer is a positive advance in society, and everyone should be assured so, embracing its benefits for communication, work, and skill development.
1006	1008	1	3	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 is true that more and more people use computers, which I'm sure you're aware of, but is @CAPS3 really necessary. I use my computer, I used to use @CAPS3 all the time, but then I got into sports like skateboarding and snowboarding so now I got away from @CAPS3. Yet, @CAPS4 are many many people that still use them and I believe that people should really try to stop going on as much because you could start to get big @PERSON1 fat, @CAPS4 are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air. First is that @CAPS3 is possible for you to get big @PERSON1 fat, being fat is not a good thing @CAPS3 could actually be heart breaking because they can't help @CAPS3, and I feel really bad for them. I have a few friends that are over weight like @PERSON1, @PERSON1 is a very over weight kid, he was about @NUM1 lbs when he was @NUM2, I have not seen him in like a year and we had some good @CAPS2, but I do feel really bad because he is very over weight and @CAPS3 is terrible, @PERSON1 does not even know how to ride a bike, nobody would teach him anyways because he doesn't have a father and his mother is over weight as well and as fat as his sister. I don't see her anymore. So being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make @CAPS3 worse. Next is @CAPS4 are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day, messing around on the computer all day is like saying I'm just going to throw my life away. Instead of being on the computer you could be with friends whether @CAPS3 is shopping or sports you're still moving and that is way better then being on the computer trust me. Go for a walk, @PERSON1 something just try to get yourself active, it might seem dumb, but still fun, unlike the computer. I will admit @CAPS3's fun @CAPS4 are many many things to do on the computer. Most importantly is that @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air, being outside is a definitely amazing thing to do, you could be walking, be on a trampoline, @PERSON1 skateboarding anything is better then being on the computer, even just sitting @CAPS4 on a rock outside is good for your body cause you need to get fresh air in your system. Just do something that involves being outside @CAPS3 is so much fun. So all you computer lovers get off and have some fun being outside with friends, @PERSON1 your family. I hope you all listen to me and take my advice so remember @CAPS3 is very possible to get fat, @CAPS4 are way better things to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air and enjoying the world around you.
1007	1009	1	3	"Has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computers in their school? Were you ever baffled when they said they were talking about @CAPS2 in the school, that they can teach hand eye coordination, gives them the ability to learn from far away places, or even allow them to talk to people all around the world? What did you think about that? Did you agree? If you did then you're thinking about the positive side and not the negative. Many reasons why I don’t agree. Safety, the money, health. Many people said that it's good to interact with other people but not all the time if your son or daughter interacts with people they @CAPS1 know are you going to be worried? They can be asked who they are, where they live. Sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face. My friend @PERSON2 said her school got those computers and her friend @PERSON3 was asked to meet up with somebody she never knew and she ended up saying yes and @PERSON2 says she never showed up. Would you ever want that to happen to your child? Well this is only the beginning. Once your child’s school gets computers they will be addicted to @CAPS2, @PERSON1 said that ""if a child does not go out and enjoy their childhood but they want concentrate on their homework, they will just eat and be on the computer eventually they will become obese."" @CAPS2 is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers @NUM1. Have you ever wondered that? Another thing is the school will have to pay a lot of money, if your child ever damages the computers then you will also have to pay a lot of money too. Not only if your childs school gets computers @CAPS2 will benefit you guys a lot. I truly and sincerely do not believe that students should get computers. Also your students computers @MONTH1 get viruses because of inappropriate sites. Then you're going to pay for that as well. Lastly the school will not have enough money for materials. What will you do?!? Your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education! Do you still support these computers!? I hope not because there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will or will not get @CAPS2. Hopefully I gave you enough information about the safety, money and health. This is very urgent situation so please be aware and consider the risks carefully."
1008	1010	1	3	Dear: local newspaper @CAPS1 recently been brought my attention, that people should use computers. My three arguments are they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow People to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 teaches people hand-eye coordination because when people type on the keyboard the more and more they type on the keyboard and the faster and faster. Many people have more coordination first, they get used to typing then, they start typing fast last when they type fast @CAPS1 give them more hand-eye coordination. Using computers give people the ability to learn about far away Places and people because they could search google people and places then @CAPS1 show a lot of websites then when they go on one website they type in the person name and state then @CAPS1 show them the places of person. Computers give people the ability to talk with people from other place like aim, myspace or face book and people could play games and talk at the same time so the computer is very popular this time because of what people make their website do and this is why I think people should use computer for a lot of like my three @CAPS2 so @CAPS1 been to my attention that people should use computer for three reason it is teach hand - Coordination give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people so this is why I suggest people should use computer for learning and connecting with others.
1009	1011	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common by now, but people argue rather they are really needed in our society. Computers give negative effects on people, for example, lose eye sight, interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise. One out of five people wear glasses or contacts, these days. The rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes them to lose eye sight. When people use too much computers, their eyes start to hurt and lead to headaches as well. These are sign of spending too much time, but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done, or simply addicted to the online video games. This shows that computers give terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there is no limitation to him or her. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted. Online, where anyone can go on, there are millions of people that are not connected or related. In other words, strangers, interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. They can have devastating influence, no supremacy, what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort. Unfortunately, people can not trust anyone online because they don't know who it exactly is. For example facebook. People think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person. This is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. These people get not enough exercises, which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. For the reason, people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society because, they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight. Second, they are creating a unsafe environment. Last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet and overall health.
1010	1012	1	3	Dear local newspaper writer, I'm writing to talk to you about the use of computers. I think computers benefit our communities a lot. I feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster. It teaches us about everything & everything. Last we get to talk to people online In these next paragraphs I'll share my thoughts about this topic to you. My first reason is natural disasters. Computers always warn us about them. For example when hurricane katrina hit computers were able to see that on their. Many people was able to flee the city before that happened. States shows @PERCENT1 of the natural disasters computer classified them. Computers saves people live each & every day. Another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in @LOCATION1. Computers informed many people about them. Those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters. My second reason why I say computers benefit us is because it teaches us about everything & anything we learn about faraway places, new word & things that is happening in our own country. For example I had to research a person my project & all I did was type in his name & pages full of information popped up. You will be amazed how much information the computer has. Computer has everything you need on a person & so much more. This is my second reason why computers are helpful. My last reason we get to talk online. Now the internet has its pros & cons. Talking online is very fun. I mean you in many website, myspace, facebook, twitter. Its never ending. People can talk to old friends, family anybody really. But many people have to be careful cause their creeps out there. Like say you can't meet up with you friend you can @ORGANIZATION1 or ooVoo (webcam) them. The computer is you friend. So you might as well make good use with it. This is my last reason now the computer can benefit you. In conclusion I think the computer makes the world that much easier. My reason why you ask. It warns us about, natural disaster. It teaches us everything & anything. Last you can talk online and stay connected with the people who matter.
1011	1013	1	3	I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. There are three reasons I think that. My first reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason is that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First, I think people should not be staying on the computer all day because it can mess up the way you see. This can happen because from you looking at a computer screen all day your eyes can get messed up, leading to strain and discomfort. I think you should never stay on a computer for no more than an hour at a time. And sometimes you know you been on it for too long when your eyes started to hurt and feel tired. My second reason you should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when you are sitting there doing what you are doing, you can be missing out on fun things that you can be doing with your family or with friends. But some people would just like to sit all day and look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out or even being a social person, which can lead to feelings of isolation. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time is because some people will just sit there and eat food all day without moving. And this will make them get more weight as they are not burning any calories. And this can make their life harder because now they are unhealthy; they are just sitting down all day anyways, which is not good for their body. And they should be going outside and running around to stay fit and active. These are my three reasons I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One, it messes up the way you see; second, you are missing out on fun things you can do with your family; and last, people are gaining more weight when they sit on the computer all day. It is better for your health and happiness to limit your computer time.
1012	1014	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought about people's views on certain technology? While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers, and are wasting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can help with homework, interacting with people, and even help us with exercising. You'll find that in the end, computers end up as benefits for everyone. For many students, they need computers to help them understand their subjects. There are certain websites that give online lessons and tutorials for difficult concepts. Along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework and access their reading materials. My math teacher, @PERSON2, is always saying, ""@CAPS1 into the online site,"" to check for new practice problems. I've found that it really helps me when I'm struggling with my work and need extra examples. We can also ask our friends for help through messaging if we still @CAPS4't understand the lesson. That's not all we can do. There are certain sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 where we can interact with other people and share ideas. You can talk to them when they're out of town and have no cell-phone service available. You can also talk when the phone is being used and you have something important to tell them, such as helping them with their homework or sharing news. When there's no telephone reception between each other, they can still talk; over one million people in the @LOCATION1 use these sites to stay connected. People are wrong when they say it takes their time away from exercising. Many websites give good tips on how to lose weight and get in shape. They show many dieting plans such as those by @PERSON3 or @PERSON1, which can be very informative. Not only that, but they also have exercise plans with videos you can follow along to at home. It's not the computer's fault, it's the people who @CAPS4't ""stick"" with exercising and their goals. Also, the computer recommends many great gyms you can join, like @LOCATION2 fitness, which you can find reviews for. @CAPS4't you think that's a good ""deal"" for getting healthy? @CAPS4't listen to those other people; stick with my opinion that computers are benefits for everyone. They can help us with many things, above and beyond our daily tasks. I can't imagine life without them for learning and connecting. Most everyone uses computers for work and fun! Thank you for reading my thoughts on this matter."
1013	1015	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I disagree with those who support advances in technology, the people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. Would you rather spend your time on the computer rotting like a vegetable or would you rather hang out with your friend, travel to other places that you never thought possible or even go to a gym and probably lose some pounds? I vote hanging out with my friends! You know people that like to travel to far away places and have fun would rather that than waste their time on a computer. As much as people like to look at all the cool places that they check out on the internet; what's the point in just sitting there and watching the screen when you could get a plane ticket and fly to the magical place that you saw on the computer and experience it for real. Ok. I know that traveling to faraway places can be scary because you never been to that area in your life, but @CAPS3's worth the try to see new things. Ok fine if flying is not your thing then why not try exercising. @MONTH1 be you have been trying to lose some extra pounds for a while now. You could always try that instead of sitting. Think about @CAPS3, my mother was using her determination so that she could fit into a size @NUM1 and now look she is in a size @NUM1, which made her very happy. Why bore yourself to death with computers that will probably give you the wrong advice when you could always ask a friend for advice on how to get started. Yes a friend a live and breathing human being, losing some weight will help you gain confidence if you just try and put in the effort. @CAPS3's just like @PERSON1, from @CAPS2 lower said, you got to want @CAPS3 if you want to accomplish that goal of yours for real. Everyone can go for that goal with a little push! Maybe you don't want to exercise, maybe you want to hang out with your friends and family in person. If you waste your time online chatting, how are you going to chat with the people that are right in front of you at the dinner table. If you can talk online then you can probably talk to people in real life? Right? Wrong! Some people can and some people can't, it's not always the same. I am a very talkative person, but I know how to talk on line if I wanted to so why can't you try talking face-to-face? That's @CAPS3 the time has come to decide what you want. Do you want to spend your time on a computer or do you want to spend your time in the real world with real experiences. Get out your chair, turn off the computer get up and move. Put your shoes on and walk outside and do something with yourself today. Use you mouth not your hands to type. Talk to people communicate with them; @CAPS3 is not that hard once you start. Trust me on this. If I can do @CAPS3 you can do @CAPS3 too, I know you can! @CAPS3's now or never I choose now and so should you for a better life. Don't waste anymore time, go on a trip take a hangout with people. Just do @CAPS3 and see how you feel. Don't run back to that computer for comfort. Throw @CAPS3 out of your mind you can live without @CAPS3 controlling your time. You have the power to change your habits starting today.
1014	1016	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society and I am one of those people that does not agree. I disagree, because if you're on the computer all day you'll forget about important things in life. For example, you will forget to exercise, you will forget nature, you will also forget to interact with your friends and family. I promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view on this issue. People spend too much time on the computer, and they don't exercise like they should to stay healthy. Exercising is very important, that helps you with your growth and strength. Exercising helps you grow stronger and it makes you feel better. If you're on the computer all day then, you won't exercise and develop right, which can lead to health problems. Another reason, I think its such a bad idea is you do not get to enjoy nature and the outdoors. When you're on your computer you can not go on a hike in the woods to see the trees. You can not go on a camping trip under the stars. You can not do those things, in the pleasant air of nature that feels so refreshing. The last reason but definitely not the least is you will forget to interact with your friends and family in a meaningful way. That is so important because a computer could do a lot of tasks for you. It could teach you a lot of facts but it cannot say I love you and mean it. Only your family and friends could do that for you and make you feel cared for. Hopefully you understand and realize my point of view after reading this. People should stop doing this; you forget to exercise, enjoy nature, and to spend time with your friends and family who matter. All I got to say now is thank you for the opportunity to listen to my idea about limiting computer use.
1015	1017	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time indoors on screens. They won't enjoy their life outside of their houses and miss out on real experiences. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health and well-being. Spending too much time on their computers can strain your eyes from the bright light. Some people with seizures including myself would trigger an attack and cause us to space out, which is dangerous. Spending too much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body from poor posture. To me that's very unhealthy and should be avoided. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends in person. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family who care about you. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time for games or social media. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family over dinner. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ignore you and think that you don't care about them anymore, which hurts relationships. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your social activities with other people and your ability to talk face-to-face. My final reason why spending too much time on the computer is bad is that you're not enjoying nature and the world outside. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer all day long. Yes you can learn things by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself outside. Being on the computer too much will make you not want to exercise and that won't be good for your body in the long run. You would forget to at least go for a jog in the park, discover new things in your neighborhood. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it on a screen; the air feels fresher. Those are my reasons why spending too much time on the computer is bad for you. Its not healthy for your body or your eyes. You don't interact well with your friends or family and become distant. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself and the peace it brings. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you outside, where real memories are made.
1016	1018	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Think back a couple decades ago, before computers existed. What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives; then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixels all day long, as well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as the number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up significantly since computers came into our lives? Why? Because people spend way too much time on them and not enough time exercising! Another affect of the long hours spent in front of the screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, for instance, had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" said one concerned parent at the local school. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse. A large percentage of parents have not been monitoring their children's computer usage; parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from one country to another! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to inappropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! These unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""friends"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. One eighth grader at the school commented, ""I can't imagine only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" Imagine never seeing your best friend in person, only through technology! It might not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you might not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I strongly urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today."
1017	1019	1	3	Dear Editor, I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this letter, it means a lot to me. I am writing today because it has come to my attention that some people are saying that computers do not benefit society. Those people are very wrong! Computers are amazing! They allow easier research; I can learn about other countries, and can talk to people online. I do all of this stuff almost every day! We're just finishing up a pretty big research assignment for English and social studies. It involved taking notes from different sources. Luckily, I was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic, just by typing the keyword! We can narrow down our options so easily because you can search for something so specific. After you find your topic, you can check and see if there's reliable information by reading a summary. All of this can be done in about fifteen minutes or less. This would be nearly impossible without a computer. I have a few relatives in different countries. A while back my family and I were trying to plan a trip to visit them. We were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport. It gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there. I've also been able to do plenty of research on other foreign countries at the push of a button. It's so simple and convenient, too! My two uncles live far away. On Thanksgiving my mother was upset because she missed them. I was then able to set them up in a video chatroom so my mom could talk to them. This is great; it's so convenient to be able to send an instant message. I can talk to people all over the world and it doesn't even cost any money! In conclusion, computers are very helpful because you can learn about foreign countries, have easy access to research, and can talk online. There's a long list of other things that make computers great, but it would take too long to write. Thank you again for listening.
1018	1020	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister, and my family talks to her through the computer. Also many people have an email! That tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stores and it saves people money using those coupons. Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the morning. My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where they're going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like. They can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are, see if it's a small school, if there are a lot of kids that go to that school and etc. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer their hand-eye coordination gets better because when you're typing you're moving your fingers and you're getting the feeling when you use it and you're getting faster at typing. Also you're not just sitting there; you're moving your fingers and you're using your brain. Scholastic kids states that kids who use the computer and use the keyboard bring their test scores up several points. In conclusion, I don't think that the computer has a bad effect, and after you're done reading this I hope you agree with me.
1019	1021	1	3	I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise, enjoy nature and interact with family and friends because it is the person's choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers affect people's lives in good ways and bad ways. People stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons. Good ways are that it educates you in many ways because when you're on the computer watching or reading interesting things you could end up learning something before you learn it in school. It's good to go on the computer for a little a bit but when you're on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat. But when you go outside sometimes you won't have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body. I think computers are a great way to have fun. You can chat with your friends; if you have a webcam you can video chat with friends. A computer is a great way for communication. Millions of people use a computer for working at their jobs. Without computers life would be ten times harder for people in this world. People like accountants use computers for their job. They store data into the computer to remember things when you couldn't write it down on a piece of paper. People also make websites on the internet to help educate, like when you type in a word it could give you a definition. People also make search engines; search engines are some engine on a website that searches for things you type in. When you type in something you will get what you were looking for. My whole point of explaining this is that it's the people's choice if they would like to be on all the time. Because computers and internet connections aren't free. It doesn't even do anything bad to your brain. It mostly educates it. People even go to school online; they learn and study on things that are on the internet. Plus you could get a job at places for working with computers. You could make programs, and anything you would want. So my statement here is that it's okay to spend a lot of time on your computer instead of exercising, going to see friends and family and enjoy nature. I think that computers are fine and it doesn't matter how long you're on it; it just depends if you're learning and not playing games all day and being lazy and getting fat.
1020	1022	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers positively affecting society? As technology advances, humans are relying on them more and more; most people use them daily. I believe computers affect people positively because they help write papers, are a social tool, and are a big help with research. After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a positive effect on people in society. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is they help with writing papers. Whether it is writing a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand. Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is. This helps the people writing the paper because writing takes many drafts to get the piece perfect; it is a pain to write each draft by hand. In addition, it is easier to read someone's writing when it's typed, especially if the writer has bad handwriting. However, computers help in more than just writing papers. My second reason why computers positively affect people is by being a social tool. Many websites online these days have social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace. In the listed websites above and many others as well, people can meet other people through other friends and games. The nice thing about meeting them online is that you don't have to plan a time to meet the person; if you are both online you guys can begin chatting. The chatting also helps when people have long-distance relationships, whether friends, mates, or family. Online chatting helps people stay in-touch with someone they might not see everyday. That is a big help with everyone's social life, keeping them connected. Furthermore, online sites like eHarmony or Match.com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate. This also helps people who are shy get married and start a family. This helps people live happier lives, another positive effect. Finally, computers positively affect people by making research much easier. My dad always says ""You kids got it easy. When I was growing up, we'd to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" Now, it's simple. Using the internet and a search engine, all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds. Libraries might not have the most recent books, or someone might've checked out your topic's book. Then what can you do? The internet is also an extremely useful help when the research topic is very specific, if it's a certain bacteria or species that a book might only briefly mention. The internet has a much broader range of articles, so it is much easier to find information for any topic. With research taking less time, people can spend more time enjoying the day, like playing outside, than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic. This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on society, because they help write papers, they are a social tool, and are a big help with research. Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything? Think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites. What about how hours of research are now two clicks away? Computers have changed our lives for the better, and we should appreciate all they do for us."
1021	1023	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you today to show how I feel on how computers have an effect on people. Computers have a very strong negative effect on people. Computers can cause people to gain weight, cause problems for their eyes, and lead to financial issues like not being able to pay bills. We all know that we all gain weight at some point in our life, and we can lose that weight. But if you are on a computer for six hours a day you don't have time to cook a real meal. So what do you do, you eat a lot of junk food and unhealthy snacks, which contributes to weight gain. Do you really want to be the reason why someone is over weight? Picture yourself looking at a bright computer screen for six hours non-stop. Do you think that your eyes are going to be fine? I disagree. When I really tried I can't even keep my eyes open and I'm pretty sure you can't say that your eyes are going to be fine when you just got done looking at a bright screen in the dark. This prolonged strain can lead to serious eye problems. Can you see yourself quitting your job just because you say you're going to work at home? But you don't do your work, and get fired, now how are you going to pay your bills with no money? Once your power goes out you have nothing to do because you got fired all because of your computer. Now what are you going to do with your life? Well that is all. I would like to thank you for your time. And I hope you agree with me for my three reasons: you can gain weight, have eye problems, and struggle to pay your bills. These are significant downsides to excessive computer use that we should all consider.
1022	1024	1	3	"You are the visitor, click here to get your prize! That is a normal thing that will pop up on computers, they can give you viruses, and people can get your personal information. That is one reason computers are bad. On top of that, ""Kids on computers more than ever are abducted each day!"" says an official from the missing child agency. They get abducted because kids go on chat rooms and get themselves into trouble by talking to strangers. On another note we rely on computers too much, it is not healthy for us. ""Pop up ads cause many problems,"" says a leading security expert. More than half of the people in the world have computers. This was from a world wide poll. More than a quarter of that is kids. When kids are on computers they always click on the pop up ads. These ads cause catastrophic problems! Peoples computers get viruses, identities get stolen, and credit card information gets found out. Therefore with those things happening you are going to yell at your kids, but you can't blame them they just thought they were going to get a free prize. Now that I have told you about pop ups let me tell you about chatting. Chatting on a computer is just a bomb waiting to be set off. ""Chat rooms are the main reason. Now that I have told you about chatting let me tell you about how people rely on them too much. Instead of looking up what a book was about, just read it! Everyone thinks a computer is the answer to every problem when in reality a significant portion of the things on the internet are false, says a technology magazine that deals with the disadvantages of technology. I remember when I needed to know if my flight was canceled, so I went online and looked it up. The website I went on said it was canceled but later when I called the airport just to make sure, they said it took off when it was scheduled to! And instead of an e-mail just send a letter! Do you want your kids abducted from chat rooms? Of course not, and do you want to miss your flight for vacation? No I don't think so, computers are very bad and are used too often. No one wants their identity stolen from some pop up ad. We need to do things on our own more often and stop relying on computers to do everything for us, as this dependence creates significant risks and problems in our daily lives."
1023	1025	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. It teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best technology inventions yet to come that benefits society. First off, computers teach hand-eye coordination. For instance if you're in a rush to type an amazing long essay you won't have the time to keep looking back at your paper, the keyboard and the screen. So you would need to know where these handy-dandy keys are, which improves your motor skills and coordination. However, it would be a lot more trouble if you didn't have any knowledge about computers or where the helpful keys are. Secondly, people would be able to learn about faraway places. If somebody wanted to take a nice, relaxing vacation or honeymoon with their beautiful wife they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring, and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious, freshest restaurants, and hottest stores in this enormous populated city. Without a doubt, I would love to take a vacation, but if it's going to cost a fortune I might have to re-consider this amazing trip, and a computer helps with that planning. Lastly, you can talk online with other people. On blistering cold days when you can't go outside, or call them because you don't have a phone, you can message them on social media as long as you want as long as you have a connection and an email address that nobody else has. Now it's time to decide! Do computers have a positive or negative effect on people. In my opinion computers are great for society and we should keep having them around because they teach hand-eye coordination, and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Best of all, you will be able to talk to your friends and family online. This is certainly a great form of technology people should have and embrace for its many benefits.
1024	1026	1	3	"Dear trained reader, Hello! Ah, I love hearing my computer thunk on when I wake up. Such a lovely sound. Some people feel the need to disagree and say computers are bad for people. But, I feel the computer is a magnificent invention. All that typing will help improve hand-eye coordination, you can look up anything in the world, and you can even meet new people and keep in touch with faraway friends. The world is just a click away! What's this? You need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills at the same time? No need to worry, you can just type that paper up on the computer! This is one of the many perks of owning a computer. Typing a paper is so much faster than writing it out by hand. Studies show that typing a paper is significantly faster than writing everything out. Even a noted handwriting enthusiast says ""Typing is so much easier than having to write! I type all my books now instead of proper handwriting."" It's been said by officials that most hand-written lovers are converting to typing for better hand-eye coordination. If it's used by the people that oppose it, it's gotta be great! Let's say you're doing a project on panda bears, but you don't know anything about them. What do you do? Search it up on a search engine of course! A search engine is a bounty of information, serving up morsels of links for any-and every-topic. I remember this one time I had a big report to write but I didn't know anything about the subject. So what solved my problem? The search engine! It's been proven that a vast majority of information found online is true. You know what else on the computer can help you with information? Just about any domain name on the web. Just type what you're looking for, add .com at the end and voila! all the information you could need. Hm, what else can the computer help with? I know. Your friend that moved away, you can send her a message and get back in touch. Or, if you don't like your friend that moved away, you can meet new people. For example, there are sites designed to match people up for romantic relations. So maybe you don't like computers. Oh well, all I can tell you is that you're missing a lot: great hand-eye coordination, magnificent information, and colorful people. Like I said, the world is just a click away, offering endless opportunities for connection and learning."
1025	1027	1	3	"Dear readers many people use computers but, not so many people think the internet benefits society. Well, I disagree! I think this because the internet helps you connect with people you're looking for. The internet also gives you the advantage to shop online. If you don't have a navigation system, you can get directions online. If you read more you will see why I support these details. Have you ever heard of popular social media sites? Well in case you haven't, they are social networking sites that help you connect, chat and find people you are looking for. I have an account and they're not that bad. They're actually fun. There are games you can play, quizzes you can take and you can chat with your friends. It's a great way to find someone you know in another town or even another country. This is one reason the computer is a good source. If there is ever a reason you can't drive to the store or wherever you need to go to buy something, you can shop online and buy it! You can just type in the address of the website and look at all the stuff they have and click what you want and buy it! They even have grocery shopping online. So next time you're really upset that you can't go shopping, just shop online. ""It might take a while to get your purchase items, but it's worth the wait."" What if you don't have a navigation system? well if you don't, don't worry! you can go online to a website such as a map site. All you have to do is type in the address where you're starting from and then the address where you're going to. Then you can print out the directions so you won't be lost! That's definitely an advantage! So, don't you think that the computer is a definite advantage to almost everyone? Well I do! you can use it to find people you need to find, you can shop online and you can easily in less than five minutes get directions! That's why almost everyone should use a computer for these wonderful conveniences."
1026	1028	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that two out of three @CAPS2 own a computer? Computers are a very helpful tool that benefit everyone in society. They allow people to communicate with each other, learn, and teach hand-eye coordination and other good things for school. Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society. The advance in technology has upgraded computers, and now allows people to communicate through them. For example, new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from your computer screen. This allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch. With my webcam I am able to keep in touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another way of communication is through email. Through the internet, people can type messages back and forth. It is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate. As well as webcams and email computers grants people access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 for instant messaging or @CAPS4. On these websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily. It is not difficult to do, like writing a letter would be, so people can communicate more efficiently and easily. Computers are very helpful for communication along with learning. Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything. For instance, they could learn about foreign plants. All they would have to do is go to the internet, type what they were looking for, and it would come up on the screen. It would allow people to learn about places all over the world. Also, people can see pictures on the computer. For example, if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway, they could type in the place and see what it looks like. However, the computer does not just show places. People could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about. Plus, with new websites being created, people could actually see what the earth looks like from space. They can look at houses, the wonders of the world, and much more; computers give people the opportunity to learn about so much more. Learning more would help people, especially students to have a better education. If you ask anyone in school, they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool. Firstly it allows them to type. Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier. It will also look neater and more organized. Plus, computers teach students hand-eye coordination. By typing or even just clicking the mouse, students are bettering their coordination. This is due to the fact that while they are looking at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even looking. Lastly, computers help students because if they need help, they can just ask one of their friends through the computer. Students would better understand the content they are learning and when they go to school, they would already know it. Therefore, computers would lead to students getting better grades. Computers play a big role in society today. They are a way of communication, learning, and allows students to do better in school. Overall, computers are a very beneficial tool in our society.
1027	1029	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? @CAPS1 you use facebook, @CAPS2, or any other type of social networking site? Well if you are like the majority of the respectable, caring @CAPS3 in this country you probably answered yes to both of these questions; and you most likely also believe that the computer is a great tool to teach hand-eye coordination, as well as an awesome way to talk with other people online. Not only that but you should notice the great potential the computer has for showing us distant, faraway lands and cultures. What would we be able to do without hand eye cooridination? Nothing that is what we could do. Without the hand eye cooridination that computers and video games help you develop, you wouldn't even be able to go outside and enjoy a peaceful game of tennis, baseball, or even basketball all because without hand eye coordination you are clumbsy and your depth perception is off. If it weren't for hand-eye cordination you wouldn't even be able to pick things up because your hands wouldn't go where you eyes were looking. Even though the computer isn't the only way to learn hand eye coordination, it is still an important stragedy that takes no effort to perform. If you are a social butterfly and love to converse with other people then you simply must own a computer! Computers, cell phones, pda's they are all the same, and that's because they are all same form of a computer. When you think about it, our country would be no where without these spectacular devices. These computers helped to industrialize and grow our great superpower of a country. Can you imagine having to drive to people's houses just to talk to them. These machines get our messages and vices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds. They are a great inovation in technolegy. Imagine having a paper for college or an assignment at work due tommorrow, and you have messy handwriting. There is no way you will get it done in time and have it be legible; and worse is that you'll be fired or expelled if it's not done. But your savior has arrived! The computer improves peoples hand writing, speed, and research all at the click of a few buttons. With computers theirs no more need for long tedious hours of handwriting or seaching through books at the library. What would happen to us with out this wonderful invention? The time has come for you to decide for yourself, @CAPS1 you like this time saving, teaching invention that you can socialize on, or would you rather go back to the stone age? The choice is clear for a modern society.
1028	1030	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention that we have created. Some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and not hanging with your friends and family. Wait I also agree but spending time on your computer can actually be a good thing. It can be a good thing because you can learn something new every minute, you can also interact with your friends on it, lastly you can do things at the same time like hang with your friends and getting exercise. Every minute you are on the computer you can learn something new! For example, let's say that you are on a gaming sights playing a game and suddenly an advertisement appears. It will most likely give you knowledges about the advertisement you are watching. Also study shows that everytime you are on a computer for atleast @NUM1 minutes you can learn something new you spend your time. Another way for them to communicate is via internet or computer. This way you can make arrangements with friends or join online groups. I know that spending too much time on a computer is not all that great, but these are just some of the benefits from it so please consider this perspective before making a final judgment.
1029	1031	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I beleave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on peope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and use @CAPS2 to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that atleast @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. Thank you for your time and consideration.
1030	1032	1	3	"Computers and other devices are good for humans especially young people like myself because they are good for communication, keeping the attention of the user and providing unknown information. In this letter, I will explain. Communication is key, and technology is close the best and fastest way to use communiocation. Cell phones provide calling usage of course, but they also allow you to text someone. If you have dinner with friends and your late, with text you can send them a message and they should get it in no time at all. Email allows you to do the same as text, but you can write longer messages. Something that's really good for communicating is video chat. If you have a relative that you haven't seen in a long time you can video chat and they can see you and you can see them. It's like talking to one another in person. Keeping a persons attention is critical. Technology does that with games, music from @NUM1's, computers, game systems and the newest way, iPod's and instructions on how to do something. Of course a teacher or parents can do that, but heaving or seeing instructions on a computer is so much more exciting, which brings me back to my topic of keeping a persons attention. Technological devices are more exciting than people teachers and definitely parents but do they offer more? Information is most likiely the most frequent reason in which technology is used. If a child has a project for school, they either use the computers or asks their parents. If the parents have no idea about the question their child just asked, they say, ""@CAPS1 it up on the computer"", if you havent already done that. So in a way the human race depends on technology, actually we do depend on technology. Computers cellphones, iPods, gamesystems, etc all include a little thing I'd like to call the internet. The internet has been around for a while, going from extremely slow to high-speed, and it is a magical place. It can provide you with directions, recipes, job offers, store locations show times for movies and much , much more. Although technology is used in everyday life from communication to searching for information it can slowly bring the human race down. I mean most of us spend most of our time on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when we should be walking around are exercising, looking at the trees and the birds and communicating with family face to face. Therefore, computers and other things are nice and all, but are the worth getting fat or loosing touch with your loved ones? It is a question worth pondering."
1031	1033	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology has grown exponentially during the last few years. The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I believe this is not something to be excited about. The constant use of computers can negatively affect people's health, family and friends, and their appreciation of Nature. The over usage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat in front of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of computers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure; the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure tends to be. Just sitting in front of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healthy, one should only use the computer when it's absolutely necessary. Constant computer use can also separate you from others. This generation, adolescents especially, use the computer to communicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicating only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not to mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet, which can damage trust. Using the computer can ruin relationships, even those with family. Being negligent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can become a non-important thing. People can't pay attention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Furthermore, computers are creating false substitutes for almost everything, even nature. Humans started out living in the wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by replanting. Our connection with nature was strong; we needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People do not appreciate nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1.com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience the natural world. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when necessary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside."
1032	1034	1	3	I support advances in technology because our future world will be run by computers. People can learn about places and people that they can never afford to see for real, and lastly, this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly. Have you ever thought about the future? I know I have. Usually when you think future, you think robots and lots of automated things. The fact is the world is turning into a place run by technology and as we the people get smarter, so does the technology. So what good will the future be if none of us know how to work a simple piece of technology such as a computer? How are we going to use the more complicated things then? Believe it or not our world within @NUM1 years will be run all on computers; you will not have to do anything but will them. Without computers, how would we know about all of the stuff that we know now? How would people know what Egypt looked like @NUM2 years ago? They don't have to be there; they could just look it up on the computer and learn just as much about it as if they went there. Also, computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time. How would you learn about a president or a historical event? Without a computer you could go to a library, but with a computer the information is right there. Without computers in today's society, our average being would be in the dark about many things because of the vast knowledge that computers have given us. I can see why some experts are concerned, however, for some people this is the only connection to their family and friends. If there is a family that lives, let's say, in a different country, and he or she wanted to talk to you, how would you go about doing that? I know that I would try to contact them on the computer. I have friends that live out of state and I enjoy talking to them, so if we did not have the computers that we do, these experts are saying that we are going to drive across the country to talk to them? If you ask me that is pretty time consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope that you agree with me that keeping technology in our lives is important because of the future, for people to learn new things about places and people, and also to communicate with friends and family. Although I can see your point of view that kids are not getting enough exercise, most kids that use computers are also involved in sports.
1033	1035	1	3	Dear @CAPS1-in-@CAPS2, Computers are very helpful tools in today's society and culture. They build cognitive skills and offer a vast wealth of knowledge. I want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides. First off, computers enhance our hand-eye coordination skills. When typing, we look at the screen while using our hands to type; this becomes almost second-nature after a period of time, proof that it is helping with this cognitive skill. Having good hand-eye coordination is a critical part of driving, and many other tasks we perform throughout the day. Also, you must consider the near infinite amount of knowledge available on this tool. You can learn just about anything on the internet, and most of it is absolutely free. In fact, on websites like @CAPS3 alone, you can find a webpage dedicated to just about any topic imaginable. Contrary to the counter-arguments belief, a computer can actually aid in our social life. With instant messengers like @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 you can converse with people around the world in real time. Social networks like @CAPS5 allow you to keep your friends posted on what you are doing and share life updates easily. Please take my letter into account, and publish it in your editorial. I believe computers help us with cognitive skills, learning, and socializing. Thank you for your time.
1034	1036	1	3	Dear the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Some people say that computers are a negative contributor to society. In @CAPS3 opinion, computers have a positive impact on the world around us. I believe @CAPS4 gives people hand-eye coordination and a way to be organized. Not only those but, people are still interacting with others. If you don't believe me now, read @CAPS3 details and you'll feel the same way I do. When you consider @CAPS4, computers give us hand-eye coordination. There's no way to use a computer without typing. No matter if you're just typing in a short password or a @NUM1 page essay, you'll always have to type, and when you do @CAPS4 allows better movement of your hands and fingers. This can later help you in sports when you get out and exercise. Since computers have become such a popular thing, I think that in the future, typing or using a computer will be in the @CAPS2. This could be because of the hand-eye coordination @CAPS4 gives; @CAPS3 theory is whatever you think, you type. In addition to hand-eye coordination, computers provide organization which is a big concern in present day life. Do you have picture files laying around your house? Well, there's no need to. With computers you can store all your files and documents neatly. You can organize your photos and mark them so everything becomes easy to find and locate. Even doctors use computers to organize your medical needs and give you appointment times. Computers can give you the tools to get organized. Furthermore, computers continue to help us instead of hindering social interaction. I can talk with friends or family far away. @CAPS4 keeps us together and gets us connected. I'm not saying that @CAPS4's always a good thing, because we all need face to face interaction. Although when you aren't able to get that, it's a good way to talk. To conclude, computers positively effect our lives. We're able to get hand-eye coordination, and stay organized when life can be a trouble to manage. @CAPS4 can bring people together when they aren't able to meet in person. You can learn about new things like people and places far away. Though people @MONTH1 think opposite of me, I know that computers benefit society.
1035	1037	1	3	Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to you @CAPS4 I think people are not getting enough exercise @CAPS4 they spend so much time on the computer and they are going to websites. Here are some things that I want you to write about so people can and @MONTH1 be aware. My first reason is about exercise. Why this @CAPS4 so many people spend so much time on the computer they don't get moving. They don't walk. They sit and want to message their friends @CAPS1 day. Not worrying that they are gaining @CAPS2 and putting @CAPS3 strain on their heart @CAPS4 of the inactivity. @CAPS4 of this it can @CAPS5 to health @CAPS6. These things could mean you can't do activities @CAPS15. My @CAPS7 reason is @CAPS8 @CAPS9 websites that are not moral for kids @CAPS10 @CAPS11 things they are not supposed to see. When kids have free @CAPS12 on the computer exercise is the thing we let go. @CAPS11 this can @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS14 sites, gun sites, @CAPS15 to a things can make something they @MONTH1 really hurt someone or maybe even themselves. Kids try to learn @CAPS15 people talk like on @CAPS16 websites things that they are not able to handle and over time they can see Are @NUM1 on @CAPS16 @CAPS18. My third reason is chat sites. These are places where kids can get some attention. They will @ORGANIZATION1 things they are not supposed to, like talking to a @NUM2 year old man. Here are some things to write about what they are doing and please monitor them as much as you can to prevent this from happening.
1036	1038	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a world without computers. I picture it as a better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world better. Computers @MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer having computers or no? In my opinion people would be better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers is one factor to blame with the @LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy. If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in @LOCATION2 will as well. If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 says ""if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them"" @CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue. In my opinion the citizens of @LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their. more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly when your on your computer all day you don't realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals. Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more, computer should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer. @CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least your social life could improve if people werent on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would be better off without computers. I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise, enjoy for nature, also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from. There is no need for a computer in your life, but don't speak for everyone. The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good."
1037	1039	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now.
1038	1040	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON2 and I am here to give you @CAPS1 opinions about computers. Computers are fun and educational. They have lots of websites for games. Such as portaportal, @NUM1.com, they have safe fun games for kids under @NUM2. They also have educational websites that help you with your work. Such as google. Ask your question.com these websites have all the info on things you need help with. They also have @CAPS2, facebook. Yes I know there has been rumors about people threatening over chats. But other than that your able to chat with your friends instead of waiting for your mom to get off the phone. @CAPS2 lets you meet new people without having to tell them who you are. @CAPS1 opinion is that computers are safe in different occassions but are also very fun & educational.
1039	1041	1	3	I think that people shouldnt use the computer's that much because it make's you want to be on it and on it day. Like yea you can play games on it and talk to people like other people you use of lec see I can understand that but the other people around you like that live's with you people that on the computer all day can spend time with there family and friends and to other places then going to look at them on the computer's I mean like to see other people that you see on the computer like chat or like webcam on the computer, you can maybe go see in a other state and go visited them. then being on the computer people that always on the computer should get out because there never going to do things is they are always on the computer, like when @CAPS1 on the computer @CAPS1 on it for a hour are so the I do things with family and friends, but not all the time that @CAPS1 on it, like i understand if you work on the computer at work and then finishing things at home for your work, but once in a you get to spend some time with family and friends, not @CAPS4 be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and @CAPS4 go on the computer and that how people get lazy the start getting fat because they @CAPS4 go on the it and maybe stop to eat and back on the computer, then when they get off of it they will eb all tierd and stuff not feeling like going anywere @CAPS4 to sleep or like if they had sometimes to do after they would be all lazy an not wanted to do anything at all, that why people should get out more and do thing withe there family and friends to have fun withe there like.
1040	1042	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I took a poll of @NUM1 people and @PERCENT1 of them agree computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place, teach people hand-eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. Using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. Some of the ways I keep in touch with them are e-mailing, video chating, and instant messaging. Some other good things about talking to people online is if you're talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. Another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand-eye coordination. The ways of teaching this are typing, and clicking on something, @CAPS1 people, when they type, look at the keyboard. But, with pratice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. To click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. That, believe it or not, is hand-eye coordination. One last reason computers are good at helping people is it a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. Another option is , say someone is going on a vacition to @LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it. They can go on the internet and get information on @LOCATION1 with just a couple clicks of the mouse. Finally, say someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 for fun: They type @ORGANIZATION2 in look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. In conclusion, I deffinately think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons I have stated. People can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand-eye coordination, and finially, people can look a person or place up using the internet. This is my opinion on computers, I hope you agree.
1041	1043	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is John and I am writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that eight out of ten homes have at least one computer in their home? Well who wouldnt! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, its quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like Skype and facebook you can talk to people you normally dont get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet you can use websites like google, Wikipedia and the National Geographic site. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also if I had to research a topic for my history project then I would go onto the computer, to google and then type in my topic and be overwelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an A+ on the project thats how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick I can make twenty powerpoints slides filled with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make one powerpoint slide: on overage ninety percent of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing my social studies project last month I had to find out what the Canadian flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library. I just hopped on google and clicked images and clicked images and typed in Canadian flag. Within seconds my screen was filled with real and edited pictures of the Canadian flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of facebook, myspace, Skype, or twitter? Well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am on Skype or facebook I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time one of my friend from camp lives in Australia so I dont get to see her alot so with the wonderful invention of facebook I could talk to her all the time. Just think without the computer facebook would have never been invented so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also when I go on the computer. I have the option signing onto something called Skype or email. With this I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That would happen if the computer wasnt invented. So dont you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well lets make it ten out of ten homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer.
1042	1044	1	3	"Do you really think we need computers to live? I agree on spending less time on the computers and spending more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. I think this because of my family. And we don't need computer games we don't need computers when we are lost on and don't know where we are we get a map, not a computer we need to look for something we use ipods. If some people like to chat with each other they use cell phones. Lets say you have a project in class libraies are available. Seventy percent of kids like to read. A library is great way to bring your reading up. If you don't get that right ideas when you read then you can ask your teachers, if it is appropriate time. Like afternoons or during lunch time. One day when I went to class there was a project due and kid said ""I copy all of the words for the computers."" And that is call pradizing. So some parents don't see there children pladerize. Sometimes internet is not good for children. Sometimes you need take a break and slow down. You can take a trip and see your family. You can also look out to nature. Exercise, hike, swim and bike. Computers are not family there are not going to make you exercise there going to make you lazy. Now that you've heard about why you should stop going to the computers because you have electronics, libraies and family. You should stop and make a change right now. There is nothing to loose by choosing a more active and engaged life away from the screen."
1043	1045	1	3	"What do you think about computers? I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have access to one. Please heed the following advice. Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. It teaches them life skills such as hand-eye coordination, and a lot about technology. Expert Dr. Evans states ""Eighty percent of success full jobs involve some kind of interaction with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts."" Technology is a major part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grevious idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age twelve, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law ferm as presidental secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future. People say kids are the future, not if theyre not succesfull. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn & communicate with one another & others. We all want our kids to be happy. Four out of five kids use the internet to research things for school & projects. Kid therapist Dr. Miller says ""kid who chat, with other kids though internet like facebook, MSN, & myspace are normaly more socialy interactive with other kids. I know you thinking there a lot of ""bad"" thing on the internet dont want my kids to see, conversly you can set limits & child block. & you also dont want you kids at risk of obesity because of lack of excercise. So give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer two hours a day. They do homework & whatever time they have left they chat with friends. Its not all bad. As you can see computers can be seen in a very possotive manner. Heed my advice & allow your kids the freedom of internet. They will be happier and more prepared for the future, trust me."
1044	1046	1	3	Do you like your computer? Does it benifit you and the people around you? People are saying that computers dont benifit people. I am writing to prove them wrong, and state why computers benifit us. It helps us with things like learning, communication, and even money or economic problems. First, learning is a very important in a lifetime and computers can help you increase that one hand-eye coordnation is very helpful in different sports like tennis, golf, and hackey too. When you go on the computer, you learn that skill. For example, last summer i went to tennis with mom and shes never on the computer. She missed every ball thrown to her. Thru computers all around the world, and going on the computer can open you to the whole world. You can see places like Paris, Tokyo, and even the pyramids. Africa overal, has the least computers out of the whole world. Finnaly, computers let you learn typing. In america, there are jobs that are for you to type. If you learn to type, then you can get a good job. If you get a good job, then you can be succesful in life. Computers definetly benifit your learning. Second, communication is another area where computers help. Computers open you up to meet new friends. One, when you go to school, you can connect more with other students. Computers let you talk to your friends online. According to facebook magazine, sixty-five percent of all the students in a school chat and talk online to other person. Two, the computer can help you communicate with your family too for instance. If your grandmother got hurt, you could e-mail that grandmas hurt. Computers can connect your family too. Finnaly, computer can help half the people in life. For example, kids with cancer, or even those who need to check their health can use computers to let you talk to this kinds of specialists. Computer are very helpful when it comes to your social life. Finnaly, computers help you with financial matters. In that economy it's really hard to find a job. So the computer can help you with that websites online make you take a test that actually gives you a place to work and earn a living.
1045	1047	1	3	"Dear School Board, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of cyber-bullying and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. ""I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live."" That quote was said by Michael, a former student of Riverdale High. He is as victim of cyber-bullying. Thousands of students just like Michael are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like Michael's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, five cyber-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are five lives that could have been saved; five families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends forty percent of their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In 1995, children spent ten percent of their day in front of a computer and thirty percent outside. Over the past fifteen years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting cyber-bullying which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better, for computers are truly ruining young lives."
1046	1048	1	3	Dear readers, @CAPS1 if I told you that every time you sit in front of a computer, you are that much closer to death? @CAPS1 if I said that computers are destroying your lives? This @MONTH1 not be that serrws, but its shocking. You can not disagree. I feel that humans should not use computers, or at least use them very scarcely. Computers make people get less exercise, they kill brain cells, and they can ruin your lifestyle. You @MONTH1 believe computers have impared your life, but the long-term consequences remain. Many @CAPS2 today are obese and lazy. They don't get any exercise. There are many reasons for this, but one big reason is because they sit in front of computers all day! Computers @MONTH1 improve reflexes and such but you can do that by exercising, also! When you sit in front of a computer, it reels you in. Ten minutes becomes one hour in a snap! That is one less hour of exercise, one less hour of movement. Virtual sports @MONTH1 be fun, but they keep you from the real ones, from feeling the sun and air. Without exercise, one @MONTH1 become obese, develop diabetes or heart problems or even have muscle troubles. These can be hazardous, and even deadly. Computers dont exercise your body, or your mind! Now, that fact bring me to my next point. Computers @MONTH1 have information to teach you, but that type of learning has its consequences. When you sit in front of a computer, your eyes are on the screen. Now, scientists from the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation have found they staring at the screen kills brain cells. Basically, these cells do not reporoduce as easily as other cells, and they sometimes don't reproduce at all, leading to a slow decline. You are just one step closer to death. I'm sure you don't want an death. Try opening a book! They are cheaper, more accurate, and don't kill your cells! Don't stare at the computer screen, because your slowly destroying your body, and knowledge can be gained elsewhere. For a final point, I would like to say that computers simply destroy your lifestyle. Virtual people are not your real friends and family. Computers cause you to turn away from them, to ignore the people right beside you. Online interaction is not like just talking to someone in person or on the phone. You can lose your real friends. Plus, computers run your lifestyle because half the things you think you are learning arent real. You can't trust certain sites or certain people. Being with ones you know and love is much more beneficial, because computers drag you in you are taken away from the real world, from real experiences. I feel that we should all take a stand against computers. They take away exercise, cause brain cells to die and other problems occur, and they can ruin your lifestyle. No one wants to be a lonely joke! Read a book, get outside and day; but stay away from die screen. There are better alternatives. Take a stand, and do @CAPS1 is best. Be the healthy, happy person, and lay off that computers, so that you can get the best of life!
1047	1049	1	3	"Dear edditer of my local newspaper In my opinion computers have a positive effect on people. I support the advances in technology. I believe @CAPS1 is a positive thing because @CAPS1 teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allows us to talk online with others. In the following poragraphs I will share with you my opinions and why they are the right opinions for all to believe in. Firstly hand-eye coordination plays a big part in our lives, many of us do sports. Now sports isn't just about being the best @CAPS1's about getting better and doing your best. Sports take alot of practice, and are way is computer games though I bet you didn't know @CAPS1, these games help you develope hand-eye coordination. Defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports, improving your reaction time. Catching and throwing is a big part in alot of sports and thats all hand-eye coordination, and where do you think you get @CAPS1 from practice and computer games. So next time your on the computer play som games and that will be like practicing for sports and will help you devolop the hand-eye coordination you need to suceed in a sport. Secondly, @CAPS2 in favor for computer use is because @CAPS1 gives us the oppurtunity to learn about places and people from all around the world. Think about @CAPS1 before computers if you want to know something you might have to locate all around for a book that tells you @CAPS1, @CAPS1 could take hours, now you type what you want to know or google and bing theres your answer. This ability to quickly find what your looking for allows you more freedom to learn and spend other precious time doing other things you want to do then take the time to locate and read the right book. As you can see this is a great ability and can be a big help when you need to know something fast. So help you yourself and use computers make life easyer. Thirdly computers are a way to communicate they can let you talk to people all around the world, when you might and usaly be able do. This is a great way to stay in contact wen people move, go away on a buisness trip go on vacation, or even to meet new people. Say you cany get a hold of someone because there phone is off and its important you talk to them you could email them or if there online and ahave @CAPS3.M. you could @CAPS2(instant message) them. This would save you the hessle of having to keep calling him. Also if you want to see what there doing or where they are you could us a webcome and see them instead of just talking to them. As this paragraph shows internet and computers open more doors then ever before. As the I wrote above, I showed not even a fraction of what computers are good for. My reasons for computers being more of positive thing, ever a negitive thing are as followed; they help us with learning things that before we couldn't, communicate with others, and help us develope hand eye coordination. I can only hope that as I write my conclusion, ""that my opinions were heard and that this letter has helped all see why computers are a great thing, not a bad one."
1048	1050	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2 ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1"" I'm sure you all have heard the sound of a mouse or people typing if you have walk into an office, our local library, a doctor's office, or even our districts schools. The reality is that computers and the world-wide-web is seem and used everywhere. Without a computer, how would @CAPS3 be able to access our emails, interact with family memmber across the ocean and finish that research paper out teacher has assigned us? In my opinion, computers hace a phenomenal affect on people and their lives. The computer helps develope hand-eye coordination, learn about specifil subjects and interact with people on the computer. Therefore, with such positive affects, @CAPS3 should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done. Have you ever walked into your schools lab or walked into a office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mouses or the buttons being pressed down on the keyboard? Well, not only is a job being completed, but you are also exercising your fingers and hands. I remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay. After the second page, my hands hurt very badly, @CAPS4, not only was i completing my essay, I was also exercising my hands. Not only does computers allow you to exercise, it also helps develops hand-eye coordination. Have you ever played a game where you had to cath fist, or playes a fast-pasle game of pinball? Well, those games require one key thing i hand-eye coordination, which is a valuable skill. Computers are very helpful in todays world. The computer and the world-wide-web is useful in several other ways too. The internet also allows you to learn about certain subject or events you might not have a book for. My bestfriend, @PERSON1, called me one day from the train. On the phone, she was frantic because she was giving a speech and she did not know what the statistic was for type @CAPS5 diabetes. What do you do when you have no book for a specific subject? @PERSON3 went on her laptop and found all the information she she dit not know in just minutes. this is just another way the quick acces to a computer benefits people. ""You've got mail"" I'm sure you have all heard this before. Besides communicating through letters or on the telephone, the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication. when you need to confirm a meeting place or ask your classmate what problems were assigned homework, what could be a fast mean of communication? Sending a instant message, or e-mail are two ways of course. Not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately. Both your e-mail account and you instant message account have passwords so that only you can access them, keeping your conversations secure. Every four out of five households have a computer avalable for completing assignments, checking, e-mails and learning about the events, that happend in @LOCATION1 last week. The computer has put a positive affect on numerous people and their everyday need. In my opinion, the computer has been one of the best technologies in history. This amazing technology has helped students, teachers, doctors, police officers and even you bank aggents serve our community and make it a better one. Thank-you for considering my viewpoint."
1049	1051	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 society should have computers because it teaches you things that a school or job will never teach you, and it allows you to be in contact with your friends and family that you don't see a lot. I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @CAPS1 society should have computers. First, we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before. I say this because if you wanna know about the @LOCATION1 more and the school or job doesn't teach you as much as you wanna know, then all you have to do is look up on the internet and theres a chance you gonna find it, you can find detailed information. @NUM1 people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all, which shows its value. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 society because we could contact people online that we heven't spoke to. My opinion is that if you haven't to a friend or family member in a while you can talk to them online, you can reconnect easily. Also, if they don't have a phone or if they do but it's long distance and you can't talk to long distance on your phone, you can tlak to them on or email each other, etc. Sample say if your phone isn't working and the only thing that's working is your computer you to it in contact with somebody, ensuring you are never truly cut off. All you gotta do is talk to them online. Would you rather talk on the phone or computer, both have their place. In conclusion, @CAPS1 society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people, staying both informed and connected. I would like for you to aprreciate my concern on having computers in @CAPS1 society and consider the benefits they provide for everyone.
1050	1052	1	3	"Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today, prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities? My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day. The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise, children tend to be addicted to playing on the computer, and if someone's life revolves around the computer than they most likely, won't be able to live on the ""real world"". When a child sits at the computer all day, they are not getting exercise. Today, obesity is a major problem. If people stay on the computer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease, leading to healthier lives. Also, it is important for children to get fresh air. When someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors, which is vital for health. Lastly, who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports, to stay active and have fun, building teamwork skills. Once you begin to play games on the computer, there is not turning back. In today's society, children of all ages, become addicted to the computer. Children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings, ignoring family and friends. Also, some of these games might be inappropriate for younger players, containing violence. Lastly, if children become addicted, they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework, as the computer is too distracting. If a child is constantly on the computer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the ""real world."" In the ""real world,"" you can't rely on computer games to solve problems. Also, games won't teach you things that you can only learn during school, like social skills. Later in life, when you want to get a job, you won't be able to be accepted because you will not sound knowledgable. Lastly, when you are writing your application to go to a college, they will look at your records of sports and activities you've done in middle school. When they don't find anything, they will reject you because of your lack of participation, seeing you as one-dimensional. So when you are sitting at the computer screen, remember all the possibilities you have other than the computer. For example, it is important for you to exercise, playing games on the computer could make you addicted and you won't be prepared for te ""real world"". What is your opinion on this important matter?"
1051	1053	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I believe that computers have a negative influence on people. When people are on computers all day they have less time for exercising. They are in alot more danger, and they spend less time with there family. These are my only some reasons why computers dontbenefit society. In more detail, more time spent on computers equals less time exercising. With the obesity rate rising no one wants to be unable to do regular activitys. With spending all your time on the computer, you would just be using it to get over weight and unhealthy. It also makes many people feel self consiou about themselves. If they dont have enough time exercising and keep eating they will become even more self consious. More over it will bring more danger to you and your family. There are many places on the internet where you can meet new people. But how do you know if people are who they seem to be? If you spend more time on the computer then you will increase your chances by @PERCENT3 to get a personal assuts, or even give you personal information up. So why should you take the risk? Just get off that computer! Even if you dont meet on internet assuter you will still be glued to your computer cauzing it more likley to be harrased. I definatly dont want that for my family. The last reason is the most important to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 family. If you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family. This time is verry important because you never know when your family will be gone! And it is a verry scarry topic to think about. I know that most people in @LOCATION1 was spend all the time with there family. On another note a survey shows that @PERCENT2 of children that spend time with there family and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes. Wouldn't you want to make the honnor role in your school? In conclusion, computers have a negiteve effect on people! Spending most time on your computer can causes less time spent exercising, more danger/harm to people, and less time spent with your family. Wouldn't you just rather spend less time on your computer? Thank you for your time.
1052	1054	1	3	I think computers are very benefical. There are so many uses! From learning, to games, to videos, and to a tool that is very useful. Without computers we would be like the @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 offense any @CAPS1 people). We would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to see becalling news. Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are lots of things to do. You can play online games, off-line games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. Without the internet I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I now am a member of the online community called www.MOCpages.com I post my creations, look at others creations, and comment, and chat. I use the internet to reasearch for school projects. Right now, I am reasearching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Normally I would have to slave over books to find something. Now it is much easier, because keywords are matched. Finally, it is a good fool. Did you know the millitary needs computers to store info, attack, keep record, and to pilot certain planes? I need to use a computer to type up home work, because as you can see, my hand writing isn'@CAPS4 the neatest. Also, I stay in touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I persuaded you on my position. Remember computers, do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a fantastic tool. Thanks for reading, bye!
1053	1055	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, To many people it is so much fun but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so much that they loved. My stand is that computers hurt peoples. Money, weight and sleep. My opinion is my opinion but I will stand strong with what I have. My father is favorite is the financial deal. With five kids and one laptop who would want to be happy. With people sitting and staring at a computer game all day the bills just keep billing up until you lose everything, such as your house, family, money, ect. But who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer. My favorite is the overweight problem. Yeah I agree it is nice to sit in a soft cushy chair with your computer and bowls of chips and boxes of pizza but sooner or later all that fatty food will catch up to you when you least expect it but will you get up and take a jog, run on a treadmill or go for a @NUM1 walk. Probably not will that computer game running. That wright will keep coming until you can't even move. Sitting at a @NUM2 will really have your eyes, brain, muscles and other important bodyparts due to lack of sleep and want for it. I can relate this to my brother with his dis. The be gets home, boom he is on it until maybe @NUM3 or @NUM4 o'clock in the @TIME1. Eventually he is going to get sick and I'm not to blame for it. When you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late. Now as a common teen to love to go on the computer but one thing I do not do is sit and watch movies or play games every hour of every day. I get outside and run so that I will not fall victim to weight. Financial, and body problems, like @MONTH1 people do. So don't waste your life on a game or chat room get out there and do something like sports or just get some fresh air.
1054	1056	1	3	Many people say that computer is help them in their every day life. A few examples are you could learn about places you didn't know about by searching on google. You get facts reviews about the place. You are exercising your fingers. It helps with communicating with other people. It can help you find long lost family. It reunites lots of family & friends you might have been looking for. Also with hand & eye coordination. And that means you can write/type without having to look at other features that cames through with a computer is going online. You can look & browse at things available in a store. Without driving all the way to the store & wasting gas & polluting the air. I.Ms a way of finding what's happening world wide & breaking news. You can still interact with family & friends & can meet new people. There's e-mail, instant messaging & much more. So you can always interact with & if they dont have a account signing up is. If you just go into nature you don't know what's there. You could look it up and find out what the park has to offer. And that concludes my opinion on how computers are helpful & lots of diverse ways.
1055	1057	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @DATE1 I am going to write to you about if I think computers are a good idea or not. Yes, I do think computers are @CAPS12 awesome idea. I think this because @CAPS1 @CAPS2, you use computers for school projects. Next @CAPS2, it is @CAPS12 easy way to make friends from other towns. Last @CAPS2, you @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Yes, the electric bill could be higher, but for a good cause. You @CAPS10't just assume computers are bad for us, you might be surprised. @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am going to explain to you why we need computers to do projects. Well, I @CAPS5 from personal experience, my social studies teacher always likes you to type your final draft. Also, using a computer makes your projects easier because @CAPS3 @CAPS4 fixes your mistakes, and @ORGANIZATION1 finds everything you need. I find it much more easy to use a computer for projects and I @CAPS5 all of my friends think it is also. If you aren't persuaded yet, keep reading because I @CAPS5 you will be eventually! Next @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you about making friends just with a computer. I @CAPS5 that parents these days are really happy when you have come home and made new friends. Just by using a computer you could easily go online, search friends you want to @CAPS11 to @CAPS5 better, and chat with them. (to make sure they are who you think!) The other day my friend @PERSON1 came up to me and said meet my friend @CAPS6 I met online! I was really happy for her and realized computers are helpful. Everybody needs friends that are there for them, and computers are the perfect conclusion for that! Last @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you more about why and how you could @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Do you @CAPS5 what @ORGANIZATION1 is? You @CAPS10 search @CAPS7 on @ORGANIZATION1! If you really wanted to @CAPS5 something and you were really curios you could search on @ORGANIZATION1! This is a great way to @CAPS11 educated. Also, computers help you with @CAPS12 @CAPS13 because everytime you are on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 typing a random story it will fix your mistakes, and you will learn off of these mistakes. So, to sum up this paragraph, a computer is @CAPS12 easy way to @CAPS11 @CAPS12 easy @CAPS13, and YOU need to keep computers to see for yourself. In conclusion, I was asked to write a paper to you seeing if I would like to keep computers or not. By now you @CAPS5 that I would like to. In case you are iffy about my reasons, I will simply restate them. @CAPS1, you need a computer for projects. Second, you @CAPS10 make friends. Last, you @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. All of these things are a huge benefit in laer life. Don't forget YOU @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13! That is whta everybody would like! I @CAPS5 you will come through to yourself and agree. Thank you for listening to me.
1056	1058	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficient and easy to use I will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using webcams, instant messaging, or talking on a social site like Facebook. Computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives to stay connected across long distances. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an encyclopedia or other book. Computers are much more efficient and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficient and that I like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it, finding sources and data in an instant. Finally, computers are more efficient and easy to use. If you give a person to choose from a computer or a set of encyclopedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the computer you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or encyclopedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficient than books. In conclusion, I believe that computer have a positive effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficient and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers.
1057	1059	1	3	I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, also give people the ability to learn more, and lastly they allow people to talk online. First, they teach hand eye coordination and I think that's good because when people get a job they can probably be more focused and can probably work faster. So if people can do that when they get a job and their jobs involve working on a computer it can be easier for them and their job can be more enjoyable, as they are already accustomed to the required skills. Second they give people the ability to learn more because we have all these sites that involve information and everything so people can be more knowledgeable so if they're more knowledged they can probably get a really good job that pays a lot. And they can look up whatever they like, from academic subjects to personal hobbies. So if they research a lot and go to school they can get the job they always wanted because they know so much; knowledgeable people are better people. Lastly they can talk to online people when people can contact each other its better because if they have no phone to reach someone they need to reach they got a computer that they can either email or use a webcam were they can see the person. I think that having a computer is good for all these reasons: having hand eye coordination, giving people the ability to learn more, and allowing people to talk online with other people.
1058	1060	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I don’t think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldn’t you want to go exercise and lose weight, staying healthy and active? Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that if too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity, a sad future to imagine. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldn’t get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldn’t get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it, ignoring everyone around her. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society.
1059	1061	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you think that computers have a bad effect on people? I @CAPS4. People spend to much time on the @CAPS5. When they need to be working on their @CAPS5 they get distracted and start to go and @CAPS4 their own thing. Other people sit at their @CAPS5 and get mad or angry at @CAPS6. When people dont know what to @CAPS4 they just go on their @CAPS5. When working on the @CAPS5 you get distracted. I am sight, People get distracted because they see that little internet button out of the corner of their eye. then they just click the internet symbol. Then their on the internet out doing their job. The internet is not the only distraction on a @CAPS5. The games are @CAPS10 distraction, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and hearts are all game that came on the @CAPS5 People get mad or angry at their @CAPS5 because @CAPS6 does not enough @CAPS6 deletes a they need, or @CAPS6 simply wont turn on because its dead. They blame all of this on the @CAPS5: @CAPS6 @CAPS6 does not load fast enough the person might say, ""@CAPS7 on why use you being so slow I need to get my paper for work!"" @CAPS6 the @CAPS5 deletes the paper the person @MONTH1 go, ""@CAPS9 is the paper I saved @CAPS6! are you play a game on me?"" But if the poor @CAPS5 is dead and wont turn on then the person @MONTH1 go, ""why are you turning on you stupid computed"" @CAPS10, people all of their time on the @CAPS5. They are and con't find same thing to @CAPS4 they for the @CAPS5. Not the best idea I say, People in the @ORGANIZATION1 have actsets to a @CAPS5. At home, evern on their phone. the @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1 is becoming a problem in my eyes spending to much time on the @CAPS5 can lead to be over weight because you are going on the @CAPS5 in stead of going out and hangin with your Friends. in @CAPS11 I belive that @CAPS5 have bad effect on people, They get distracted on them at work. They blame them for thing the forget to @CAPS4. They use them to much these for people can stop going to gyms and get over weight. So @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a bad on people? yes they @CAPS4."
1060	1062	1	3	"Do you have computer at home that you go on? Everyone goes on the computer for many different reasons with friends or for projects and @CAPS5 like that. Computers can be good in many ways but they can not be. Computers are made it do all @CAPS5 to help us learn. I personally think that computers are good. We can learn @CAPS5 that are going on from far away. An example is if we have a big project in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 about @LOCATION2, and we dont know the computer can look all different focus and see pictures. Computers can the history of place not us. I can sister talking how they had that has to be taken using a computer. The answer in the question world war @CAPS3. She got a @PERCENT1 we @MONTH1 also be able to see whats going on with the @LOCATION1 and different place. All you have to do for that is go on the compute and look it up. ""okay class today we will be going down in the computer to do some research."" said my teacher. ""what are we going ""@CAPS4."" @CAPS5 that are going on the @LOCATION1. All of these @CAPS5 can us research projects many other @CAPS5. We can also use computers. Computers also have different @CAPS5. An example at the program can help us that they let us look information, play game, help with our homework. I have just realized that you can pretty much do anything you want on a computer. @CAPS2 shows that @PERCENT2 of people in the @LOCATION1 go on the computer for help with their. I can remember my friend telling me that she always types her essays because its for her teacher and from typing. So the program is helpful to us. people always go on the computer and love @CAPS5 that are an save, at their. I usually do that so I know when a good is to an in the to buy what I want. Well you should really consider thinking about this those cant even reasons the people in the @LOCATION1."
1061	1063	1	3	"Computers can be very useful to people. They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet for research. If you had a friend or family member move away, computers are an easy way to contact them. Phones dont always give you that option to call from around the world without high costs. Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers. What if you want to chat with someone right next door even if theres a blizzard and the snow is four feet, computers are a simple way to contact them. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 for the @DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all by hand? Imagine you, writing out hundreds of those newspaper articles everyday. Typing is an easy solution that doesnt require as much work and it takes less time. Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read. Not even a library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library wont immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully? You cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport. You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 it upon google"" when they dont know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog, I never even heard of. When I got home I went on the internet and researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and its fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper, making it an essential part of modern life."
1062	1064	1	3	Did you know that the positive effects computers have on people outweigh the negative? I believe that the usige of computers increases one's knowledge of faraway places safety can be used for communication and can make everyday task easier computers have become the tools of society. Firstly, using computer allow a floridian to learn about connecticutions; or a canadian to learn about the world around them. safely. In a study by the @ORGANIZATION1, it has been shown that without the computer, @PERCENT1 of all people would have been ignorant of the one-child dilemna in @LOCATION3. In addition, since the crime rate in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 is @PERCENT2 having comilted, an american might not went to visit @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, they mush learn about it for a business project. What do they do? They venture onto the computer and and everything they need to know about @LOCATION1, from the security of their home. While people can learn about faraway places from the safety of their houses, can also the computer for communication purposes. The computer is a great tool for communicating with other people. In a survey done in @DATE1, @PERCENT3 of computer users had some sort of social networking or instant mesaging program. Some examples of these are @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, respectively. being able to contact people has never been easier. Did you know that out of every @NUM1 americans spend an average of a hours online everday? So truly that the average I.Q has increased in the last @NUM2 years? When online, students can receive help from fellow students, teachers, and even experts! users of the computer can get feedback from essays, support to something new, and even boost self confidence. Communication is a great utilixation of computers, as is the simplicity to perform everyday tasks online. In today's society, the computer can make everyday tasks so much easier! when I was a child, my mom spend hours in the local grocery, shopping for food. That all changed when my mother discovered @LOCATION2. It is a safe and easy way to buy food online to then have it delivered not only, but @PERCENT4 of americans with computers have paid their taxes online. A once tedious job has become simple, with the mere click of a button it is nerve-wrecking that the majority of our day need not be filled with flooring errands, but what we want! Whether that be to exercise or simply enjoy nature. In a nutshen, computers are great assets to society. They have a muriad of purposes and functions. They can inrease a person's knowledge of faraway places safely, be used for communication purposes. and make everyday tasks simple. Its hard to even ruminat how we managed before this device come along, but now it is an indispensable part of our daily lives.
1063	1065	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I do not no where to start this letter. Im writing you this letter to let you know that I think that not everyone should use a computer. My first reason not everyone should use a computer is because they get so distracted in the computer they forget about school. My second reason not everyone should use a computer is because they @CAPS4 dont spent time with there parent. My third reason they shouldn't have people use the computer often is because they would get sick. My firs reason computer shouldnt be used often is because they forget about school. They forget about it in the way that there so distracted writing or chating or playing @CAPS4 that they forget about school. @CAPS5 reason is because their grades get low. They dont do homework either. My second reason is because they dont parents. Are more could be there so the computer they dont. My third reason is because their get computer there get @CAPS4 they dont and not @CAPS5 could that they dont get no education for being in the computer. That is why is bad to use a computer a lot I hope u understand the problems it can cause for students and families.
1064	1066	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there is alot of talking and arguing about computers. Some say they are helpful to society and others say not. As for myself I am one of those on the side of which is for computers. I think the do alot less harm than good. First of all the hand-eye cordination of the user is mostly improved over a period of time, which helps withe learning musical instruments. Also it gives a great learning ability to people, particularly student. If there were computers, for a student to do a report he/she would have to read through an encyclopedia, which takes a great amount more time than plainly looking it up on the internet. Finaly computers are great for communicating with far-away friends or family. The first subject on my agenda is the hand-eye cordination skills. These skills are the ability to work with your hand and eyes simultaniously. There is a number of impacts these skills can make. The most apparent is musical instruments. If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar you must move your fingers to the notes coresponding with the screen. Another place where hand-eye cordination comes in handy is sports. One sport where hand eye cordination makes a huge impact is in football. If the ball is thrown then the wide recever must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball. I am also going to argue the vost world of learning that is provided by computers. Lets just say someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2 where would you go to find that answer? I don't know about you but I am definatley going to look it up on google (internet search engine). Also schools @CAPS1 can ask alot more of their students because they have all this information at there desposal. Lastly I would like to cover the communications abilitys that the computer puts out there. First of all let say you have a very close friend move out-of-state"" how are you going to keep in touch. You could try using phones but yet the long-distance fees have sky-rocketed over the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long distance for @NUM3 mins a day that would be over @NUM4 a month. in todays ecconmy you need to save money not talk it all away. The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each-other. So hopefully my letter will be able to surposs ""@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill"" to at least make it somewhere in the paper. People need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them, as they are clearly a net benefit to our modern world."
1065	1067	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers, and @CAPS2 people use them. It's been brought to my attension that the government is worried about people using them to much. Well I think you can't use a computer too much. They offer so @CAPS2 things such as information, communication, and life skills. That doesn't too bad. Informaiton is something we as humans live for. Also in @CAPS2 schools and jobs you need to know a variaty of unusual facts. Where can you learn these? Computers of course! When @PERSON1 (my teacher) gives us a research paper on walt disney, we use computers to find our information. With out the computer, I wouldn't know walt disney died before disney world opened. That clearly shows one of the @CAPS2 things we need computers for. Communication is another aspect of our lives. With a computer you can have @MONEY1 ways to comunicate. Yes some of these way can be dangerous but, @CAPS2 are safe. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teacher ms.casserelle set up a classwide email for us. This allowed us to email another school. This farm of online communication was perfectly safe. As long as the person using these forms of communication is sem-responsible nothing can go wrong. Where can you go wrong with that? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of your life skills can and are learned on computers? As a matter-a-fact your job involves a computer! One life skill you can learn is how to type. As I stated earlier research papers need computers, well it's not just for the information. You have to type them too. Most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other. Can you think of a job that doesn't require one at all? Ididnt think so. Information, communication, and life skills are all important to our human nature. Ithink computers are important to humans. Wether you admit it or not everything we do involves a computer to some degree. Can you spend @CAPS2 countless hours on a computer? Yes, but you need to. you need to use them to function effectively in today's world.
1066	1068	1	3	Computers are a huge impact on society, but do they make everything better? People spend way too much time on the computer. Computers do not help your brain; they can make you fat, and for a lot of people, they cause drama. People should stop spending so much time on computers. Computers do not help your brain in any means possible. Think about it; sure, you do a lot of your work on computers, but what about your kids? They spend most of their time online and doing pointless stuff. Instead, they could be going outside or even studying. The internet is open to the world, so anyone goes on it, and if your child is on the computer, they are exposed to many vile things that will not help them in the future. It is a proven fact that the less time you spend watching TV or on the computer, the better grades you get. I remember my mom always yelled at me for being on the computer and getting bad grades, so she took the computer away for a while, and now I have much better grades. So being on the computer does not make you smarter. The computer can make you gain quite a bit of weight. If you are on the computer a lot, you are sitting around, and a lot of people eat while they are on the computer. So now you are sitting around the computer eating. That can make you gain weight. I know from experience that being active and going outside or exercising really makes you feel good. Once you gain all that weight, it is very hard to get rid of it. Sitting around like a couch potato is not healthy. You can become obese. So you could say you are happy with your weight, but no one ever said it was healthy. A lot of people have died from being that heavy. It puts a huge toll on your life. If you do not want to die from being too heavy, then I advise you to get off the computer and go outside and live your life. The last thing that makes computers so bad is the drama they cause. Most people have Facebook, AIM, or other platforms, but if you ask anyone with one of those, they will most likely say they have gotten in a fight through one of those. Also, now they have something new called Formspring, which can let you be anonymous, and people go on yours and just say horrible things. One of my friends was a victim of that, and it ruins you. Also, there are so many people on Facebook that lie about who they are, and anyone can easily find out who you are. Nowadays, people know how to hack into people's computers and get info. So computers can not only be unhealthy, but they can be deadly. Why would you want any of those things to happen when it is so easy to just cut back on your computer time? Remember, computers do not help your brain, they can make you fat, and they cause a lot of drama. So please do not use the computer so much.
1067	1069	1	3	A majority of people use computers daily for many different types of things. Computers are very beneficial to society. Even though people often use their computers too much, the tasks they complete help our world run smoothly. Also, computers allow us to keep in touch with friends and family that we do not see anymore, and they teach us valuable information very quickly. Without computers, society would not run as smoothly as it does now. One way that computers benefit our society is that they complete tasks such as writing a paper, researching information, and more, much quicker. For example, if you, the journalist, needed to quickly print an article in the paper on the devastating earthquake in Haiti, computers would greatly benefit you because they would allow you to type the article much quicker than having to handwrite it. Computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently. Another reason why computers are very beneficial to society is because they allow us to maintain relationships with people from long distances and allow us to always keep in touch with old friends and family. Moving to a new city from about a year ago, computers have greatly helped me stay connected with friends halfway across the country. In a recent survey, a significant percentage of college graduates stated that a computer helps them stay in touch with friends from their hometown, but it also allows you to actually see them through video calls. Our society is beneficial because they connect the world. Another reason society benefits is because they allow people to learn very quickly. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, and more allow us to research anything we want to know at just the click of a button. This ability to know anything very quickly has a great effect on people; with this knowledge, people become more intellectual and intelligent, and with that intelligence, they make great things happen. According to a leading computer scientist at a major university, the knowledge people get from computer search engines allows them to better do important things and achieve more in their lives. Computers benefit society and have a great effect on people when they are balanced out with other important things such as exercise and socializing. They teach us new information quickly, perform tasks quickly and efficiently, and allow us to keep in touch with people across the world. If it were not for computers, things would take longer to get done and society would become worse. We need computers to do important things and complete tasks needed to live life effectively.
1068	1070	1	3	I think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because the internet has bad things online. The internet makes people stupid, and the internet makes you lazy. Those are the three reasons why you should not stay on the computer all day. One of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like kidnappings. I have seen a lot of videos and movies about kidnappings where an older man or woman starts talking to some young kids, and they go meet someplace, and the young teen or kid never comes back. Another reason is that the computer makes you stupid; for example, when I used to be on the computer all day, I would get out to get something to eat, and sometimes I would go into the bathroom to get food and then notice that that is not the kitchen. It feels like I just woke up when I got off. My last reason is that the computer makes you lazy. The computer makes you lazy because you just stay on the computer all the time, sitting on the chair without sunlight or exercise. The internet will make you want to stay there more, and it is not good for your mind and body. These are my three reasons why you should not stay on the computer; the more you use it, the more you will want to stay. So do not stay on the computer because there are bad things on there, and it will make you lazy. Please do not stay on the computer for a long time if you want to stay healthy and safe.
1069	1071	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that using a computer can benefit people and have a negative effect on people. Benefits could be gaining knowledge and meeting new people; bad effects could be weight gain and having a lack of social skills to talk with friends over the phone, etc. First, gaining knowledge is really essential. I think that is because when your computer crashes or breaks, you would most likely know what to do to fix it. I do not think you would want to have to pay money to get anti-virus software that probably does not work. Another reason why I think that gaining experience using a computer is good is that if you want to become a computer engineer, all that time you have spent on the computer could really benefit you later on in life. Secondly, I think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states. Not that you have to meet them in person; you could just have a friendly conversation online. The third and last reason why sometimes computers can be bad for you is weight gain. Most people are probably spending so much time on the computer that they are not getting enough physical activities. All they do is sit down, eat unhealthy snacks, and play games and watch videos. That is really bad for your health. In conclusion, using a computer moderately is a lot better than using it a lot. It could help you gain knowledge and meet new people, or it could make you gain weight and have a lack of social skills, so balance is key.
1070	1072	1	3	Dear editor, if you think that people spending a lot of time on the computer is good, I do not. People should get more exercise. Also, they do not get enough fresh air. Finally, they do not spend enough time with family and friends. Now we have to determine whether people should spend a lot of time on the computers. Those people who spend a lot of time on the computer could be going outside every day to get exercise. Some parents have their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going outside to get exercise. They could ride bikes, scooters, play basketball, or wiffle ball. They can also go swimming, play sports, and go to a playground. Finally, they could go for a long walk on the beach. People need to get fresh air instead of being on the computer all day. They can go sit on the beach for a while, go outside to watch their kids play or watch their games like baseball or basketball, or they can go outside just to be outside. They can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school. Those people who love to play on the computer do not spend enough time with their family or friends. They could go visit their family more often or go out for lunch with their friends. Also, they can spend more time doing things with their kids. Even though there is a chat on the computer, it is nice to talk to your friends in person. The time has come to decide whether people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not. They do not get enough exercise every day. They also do not get enough fresh air. Finally, they do not spend enough time with their friends and family. So now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which side you are choosing, but I believe the evidence against excessive computer use is clear.
1071	1073	1	3	To my opinion computers have a negative effect on people I think it has a negative because it causes people to get less exercise, you spend less time with your family and friends, and it distracts you from things you need to get done. First of all, computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get less exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games, but instead of practicing these sports, people will just sit on the computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done without even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college; those things used to include getting out and moving around, but now you can just stay inside all day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. For instance, when I went over my friend's house, I sat right next to her and she didn't even look at me because she was playing computer games. I know that a lot more kids have this problem too because I was reading in a magazine that a certain percentage of parents are not interacting with their kids as much as they did before they got a computer. Lastly, I think the computer has a negative effect because it distracts them. It distracts kids from conversations; first of all, when people try to talk with someone who is on the computer it is very hard because they are absorbed in what they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because whenever I have to type up assignments I get distracted and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. Lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're busy playing a game or surfing the web. I know that if I did that, I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people because it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people as much, and it distracts them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less time on the computer!
1072	1074	1	3	Dear Editor, Many people have been complaining about computers in our society. They say they are keeping children inside doing nothing, but really they are helping us so much! The internet is where you can research anything and tons of helpful ideas come up. Playing certain games helps us with hand-eye coordination. Lastly, computers allow us to stay in touch with people who are far away. Like last year my friend went to Poland and we were able to talk through our computers! So please join me and help the world know that computers are good! First off, I would like to say the computer is a good source of information. How would you like it if you still had to read scrolls from Greece when you could look at information online? Not to mention, if you need to know something really fast, like right before a big meeting, then all you have to do is simply type in what you want to know and bam! Just like that you know, and off to your meeting you go. Secondly, using the mouse and keys on a computer can increase your hand-eye coordination. Like my parents always say when I'm typing an essay, a high number of words per minute is a good rate. A study showed that a majority of kids get better hand-eye coordination after getting good on the computer. A lot of times kids have poor coordination, but I have a feeling that if kids work on the computer, things will change. Most importantly, the computer helps us connect with people far away. Like I mentioned before, I stayed in touch with my Polish buddy. A lot of people don't have cell phones so they have an email account, Gmail, Facebook, MySpace, or a Twitter. All of this allows us to stay in touch and keep up with our friends' lives. This is very important because if we are social then we will get out with our friends and do stuff, which is very important for our well-being. In conclusion, it is good for our society to have computers in our lives. They will help us in the future; we will get good grades on projects because of our sources. We will be healthy with good hand-eye coordination from using the mouse and keyboard. Lastly, we will have many friends. These are all very important things in life. So let's keep our computers!
1073	1075	1	3	Dear readers, I write to you today about the effects of computer usage. I feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer. You can talk to people, and you can get work done, but if you are at this too much you'll be starting to gain bad health and miss other things in life. Throughout the computer, there are many ways to communicate with others, which is an amazing thing. Whether it be through a game, typing, or video chatting, it's very important to talk to people and this makes things much easier than going out and talking to people face to face. For example, pen pals: over the years people have written letters to their pen pals, but now you can send it over email and email doesn't cost any money, just type up your letter, click a button and it's done. Another positive point about computers is that you're able to get work done on it. From work for a business to school work, it doesn't matter. You hear of people using computers to do work all of the time. Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices? Computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with for presentations, essays, graphs, anything. A concern I have of the computer is that people are becoming too addicted to computers. Many younger people are overusing computers which leads to bad health. When people sit in front of a computer screen all day only getting up to grab something to eat, people will become obese. To stay healthy people need to be outside and exercise. We need to make rules to keep people out in the open air to give the generation a healthy life. So, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be amazing for a while but only for a while, and we must be careful not to overuse them. And if you can't see this, you should open your eyes to the potential downsides.
1074	1076	1	3	To the editor of the newspaper, I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. I believe that computers are a great tool for several reasons. First, computers are a learning resource, and a way people stay updated with the world around them. Also, computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily. Clearly, computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades. Today if I need to know something, whether it be for school or my own reasons, I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources. This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them. A doctor from a university recently performed a study on high school teenagers and concluded that students with access to computers scored significantly better on standard testing due to background information they have acquired while online. Along with the internet, there are programs which help people to learn a new language, or write on the computer. Also, computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world. For example, when the earthquake devastated a region, I first saw it on the news, but got very few details. I then looked it up online and immediately got the death toll, the aid that was being given, and ways I could help donate. Without computers, I would have known none of this. Another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others. With things like Facebook and instant messaging, I can chat with people, invite friends over, and even plan parties. Without computers, I would need to call each person individually, but with computers I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once. This gives me more time to do things like play outside and exercise. Also, things like email and Facebook help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends. Studies show that a large percentage of people with some type of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not; according to a doctor this means that these people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations than those who do not. Clearly, this is a great benefit. In conclusion, the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it. It easily allows people to stay educated, updated, and connected. It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything. It makes things that would otherwise take lots of time very quick, giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside. It keeps people socially capable and active, and allows people to connect with others. Without a doubt, computers are a very good thing for our society.
1075	1077	1	3	Dear Parents, Computers have effects on people and their lives. They cause a lot of people, especially children, to spend their time after school playing games, on MySpace, Facebook, and checking their email address instead of going outside. I think that children and adults should go out and have a good time; there is not a problem with going on the computer once in awhile, but if you spend all day on a computer then that's pretty bad. Adults shouldn't let their children spend all day on a computer and adults shouldn't either because it won't help your life. Computers could mess your life up by the choices you make and pictures you put up and things you write on there. For instance, if you have a MySpace or Facebook and you put bad pictures up, in your future when you want a good job they could just look back at that and say look at this, I don't want this person working for me, and there you go messing up your future. Instead of going on the computer all the time you could go outside, do sports to keep your body healthy, and go out in the world and learn new things or even plan trips to go on with your family, walk around and stuff like that instead of going on the computers and putting yourself at risk of losing a job or messing up your future. You shouldn't let computers mess your life up because if you do then your life won't be the same. Children could mess their life up because of things they wrote or pictures they put up which other kids could see and be mean to them and talk about them for the rest of their school year, or things could lead to a fight over one little word you said or picture you put up because you thought it was cute. Sex offenders are on computers and some people don't even know it until they get taken away or killed. Parents don't always know when there is a sex offender around or online talking to you or your children trying to get them to meet up with them. They also could put fake pictures up to try to get you to speak to them or to get you to meet them somewhere so they could take you. So you shouldn't let the computers get to you, and you must be very careful about what you share and who you talk to online.
1076	1078	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in your Newspaper, The @CAPS2 Yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive amounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizen would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a woman from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought it would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunately, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. He did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, she was ecstatic to feel like she was home again. She ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer, she might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as Spanish and French have @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A, but the average grade for kids without a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and success in the future. Computers also save a massive amount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""Last night I had so much homework. I had vocals and a galore to deal with. I had to look up every word in the huge dictionary, I was failing my class because I just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, it was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in my class."" Without her computer, @PERSON6 would have to have a grade of @CAPS11 @NUM2. She would have just kept failing without her time-saving computer. Also, @PERSON3 says that @PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening on the radio. He says that @PERCENT3 of people get a raise because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computers allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertebrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a month. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher had interacted with him over the computer. Without his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationships after college. Obviously, being able to talk to someone over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does it allow people to learn about places other than their home, it also gives us more time and allows us to talk to others without ever leaving the comfort of home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer."
1077	1079	1	3	Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you could chat online. There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to their computer and learn different stuff. And you can pay your bills on the computer. People that have no phone or don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website and chat to friends and family. Also many people that have websites like Facebook, Myspace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. And some people do find that special person that they been looking for. I think that they just came out with a new electronic for little kids like Leap Frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn their alphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling. This is a good product for little kids so they can use the extra work over, the weekend or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. One day I had asked my mother what she was doing and she was paying the light bill so I was like how can you and she said on a website but I forgot what it's called and you could pay your bills right there. So instead of getting up going in your car to go to a local store where they pay bills and can wait in line, if you get a computer you can do that in your home with no hassle. So people who publish the newspaper I think and I hope you think too that this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time because it makes life much more convenient for everyone.
1078	1080	1	3	"People are asking me, ""@CAPS1 you think we should spend more or less time on computers""? I say we should spend less time on the computer because children spend too much time on online games. Second kids and adults spend too much time on Myspace, Facebook, MSN, and even AIM. My third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising. These are my three reasons why we should spend less time on computers. My first reason we should all spend less time on computer is children play so many online games, such as @CAPS2 of Warcraft, @CAPS3, Soldier Front, ect. A problem with kids playing these games is they become addicted to them, and will play for hours. Children should be outside getting bigger muscles, getting strong bones. Kids keep playing these games and are ruining their lives. This is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer. My second reason why we should spend less time on computers is children and adults spend too much time on the following: Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, AIM, MSN, ect. These online pages causes people to go on them to connect to their friends. Also with these online pages they cause too much drama and could lead to fights or rumors. About @PERCENT1 of kids and adults go on these online pages every day it's time they stopped going on their computer and spent more time outside or hanging out with their friends. My last but not the least reason is kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer. Children should go outside with their friends and play sports or games, something that doesn't involve the computer. This is my third reason why children should not be spending more time on computers. As I said before people should spend less time on computer. Kids spend too much time on online games. Adults and kids spend too much time on online pages. And last children should be playing outside. It's time we put a timer on our computer and spend more time outside enjoying the fresh air and real-world interactions."
1079	1081	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their pluses and negatives but computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt or a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not getting out and exercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change so that we can have a safer and healthier society for everyone, especially for our children who are growing up in this digital age.
1080	1082	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, You use a computer a lot right? Good if you do because then you believe that experts are questioning why people use them a lot? Well I think people need them because its how people know whats going on in the world, its how people know how the weather is like so accidents can be avoided, and you you can flip on your T.V., but than you have to wait for what you want to go on. So you decide @ORGANIZATION1, should people be outside more? Don’t you need to know whats going on too? Of course you do, everyone does. I think that it is important that people know if a meteor is about to strike the world no? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets info on whats going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? Don’t think so. Im @PERCENT1 sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn’t want to be known as the accident State. Well thats why people need the computer! For people to know if it will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic than people need to go to the internet to find out if and where and what time. CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says “if someone says ‘we might be getting some snow or rain’ than they usually go right to the internet” You you can turn on your T.V. to find out whats going on, but not all of it you will want/need to know. So you will have to wait. The internet just does it right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection) Do you think these reasons are making a good argument? I do. Do you use your computer for finding out whats going on, what the weather is like, and instead of the @LOCATION2? If so I think you would agree with me that computers are an essential tool for staying informed and safe in our modern world.
1081	1083	1	3	I think that using a computer is fine. The reason why I think this is you have family from far away. Instead of just talking and hearing a voice on the phone, they can talk to each other but most of all see each other through video calls. They can show cool things they have that are new. When you have a loved one you can see them when they are away on a trip. Computers are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car, as you can arrange for repairs or order a ride. You can buy stuff at the store by the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get out of a store because they have an online store to mail items to you. Also now you can buy food on the internet and lots more. Saving money is easier because the computer tells you where to get good prices to save money. There are lots of dating sites to meet different people to go out and give your comments. Texting on Facebook can let you save money by texting for free. You can play free online games with your friends. You can make a website and you can watch movies and shows online. There are just a lot of things you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside to exercise but I agree with some experts. A lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. With this technology, people are big; they don't go out more and they eat lots of food. But computers are very helpful in lots of ways and it is so fun. Those are my reasons why I think that computers are great and should be used more, as they offer significant benefits for communication and daily tasks.
1082	1084	1	3	Computers are a good benefit for people. First, the computer is a helpful machine in different ways, like I personally go on the computer and check for my homework with it. The computer is also good because whenever you don’t know something, you can just go on the internet and search it. Computers won't affect our health if we don’t use them for a long time, and computers could help students with making projects by using Word, Excel, and other Microsoft software. So I think computers are a great machine for people to have. Secondly, using a computer could also help you socialize with people; many students including me use Facebook, so even if we are not right next to each other, we can still talk. Computers could be used to make new friends too, “but there are people you don’t know and we are not supposed to give out our information,” said our health teacher. Computers could be useful to friends that live far away; if your friend moved to another state, you could use the computer to chat with him, as there are many ways to socialize with computers. Lastly, exercising is important to everyone, but using computers doesn’t mean we cannot go outside and exercise anymore. Maybe computers are addictive, but if you keep track of time and maybe use the computer for only half an hour at a time, you can still get the exercise you need. Exercising is an easy thing to do; children like to exercise so there should not be a problem, like my neighbor always comes over to my house and asks if I want to play football while I was talking with someone on the computer, but I still went outside to play. So the computer is a great machine that’s not very addictive, so parents don’t have to worry about children exercising. I think computers have great effects on people, like going online to do research or talk to friends. Grown-ups need them to work, which proves the computer is a great and versatile machine for everyone.
1083	1085	1	3	Computers have helped people tremendously over the past years. Thanks to computers, scientists have found cures for diseases, jobs have become easier, and communication with friends or family has become affordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people on places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk on the phone without having to pay for anything. If someone is planning a trip to a country, they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could help them find affordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country, they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events at any time and without any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her, you can video chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family, and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers instead of on the phone. Computers have improved dramatically over the years; the screens used to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up, and now computers can be as big as a flat screen television and you can turn them on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like many years from now? Their potential for future advancement remains vast and promising.
1084	1086	1	3	Dear newspaper post, I have been thinking about the way computers affect our lives. On this very topic, I am agreeing with the experts who say people are spending too much time on their computers and less time doing other things. I do believe everyone, including myself, spends a lot of time online. Even if it was for research, don't you think it would be better to stick our head in a book to get the information? The same thing applies to computer games; why play virtual kickball when you can go outside? The main reasons I am trying to get across are that computers hold us back, they are not physically able to help us, and going away from the computer, or even going outside, would be better. I had mentioned how computers hold us back; the more time we spend, the more daylight we burn to do other things. I say this because instead of going outside, we want to stare at a screen and play games or chat with friends. Online chat especially has an effect on most people because we're trading in a fun day for one where we just talk online and lack real interaction. I also believe if we had a time limit on computers it would be more of a push to be social and go out and do things. Unfortunately, computers distract from that, and all we end up wanting to do is nothing. Another reason is that computers can't physically help us and make us active. I know this one because I am a cheerleader, and I am constantly on YouTube learning how to stretch and do new things. Even though I learn and spend time to watch how it's done, I get hurt and can't do it. Which is why I try getting coaching from a gymnastics teacher who can physically help and interact with how I'm doing. Lastly, I believe that the less time we spend would help us and be so much better. I know, after an hour or more online, I feel lazy and I don't want to do anything. However, if I go outside I feel full of energy and I'm active. Being off the computer feels better and is better for your overall well-being. To sum it all up, computers are great to have, but too much of them isn't. It really does hold us back and is worse for our health. Oh, and one last thing, too much time makes you less active. However, thank you for reading and considering this perspective on computer use.
1085	1087	1	3	"You say that computers are bad for today's society? Well, I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit today's society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can log onto Facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School, school, school; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs helps a lot and gives that professional touch. And how could you forget Google, the most famous online system that everyone loves; you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society? Think again and listen closely, because computers have just benefited us more than ever. www.facebook.com is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages; it definitely benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends' profile's newest updates on pictures, videos, and life, you get every little detail using Facebook. And if you don't have a phone, no worries, Facebook has a chat system so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe there's a family party coming up; you can get inboxed on all the information and visit the relatives' homepage to see how they've been doing. If you haven't logged into Facebook yet, you definitely will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher say that? Almost every time you're given an assignment! Windows and Microsoft programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Let's say you've been assigned a project to create a product commercial in computer class; you can hop right onto Windows Movie Maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create your project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentations is PowerPoint. In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the past and were to do a presentation; when I got my assignment I went right to PowerPoint and got a great grade! Lastly, the well-known Microsoft Word is used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and especially writing papers or short stories; having spell check, you're guaranteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit can be used for just about anything, from searching pictures and information for a school project, watching videos of songs, friends, or TV shows that you love or want to check up on, to looking at websites. Some say the computer holds people from exercising, but Google can show you videos of special workouts or websites on healthy eating or an online exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously! Have you changed your mind? Have you listened closely? So your life just became a whole lot easier by using Facebook for social ability, Microsoft and Windows programs for school, and Google for life and health; you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer, which is a powerful tool for modern living."
1086	1088	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button? That is as simple as just going out and purchasing a computer. Computers are becoming more and more popular in homes and schools. Some people think that people use computers too much. I am here to say that, that is a terrible accusation. First, computers help you with school work. Let's say you have an essay and it needs to be @NUM1 words or more; you can just use a word count tool, then you have the exact amount of words. Also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic. You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from. If you had a homework assignment that you didn't understand you could look up how to do it on the internet. But this is just the beginning. Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture. You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from @LOCATION1. You would also be learning about their culture and traditions. This could also be a way to learn another language. If the person spoke fluently in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 than he or she could teach you. You might be able to see how an @CAPS2 household runs. You could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life. Finally, you can understand the world around you. There are many websites where you can get a live satellite feed of places on every corner of the globe. You could also do research on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it. You might also learn about nature and ecosystems. You could understand more about plants and animals. You can also get a look into space. You can learn about planets, if there is life on planets or water or anything else; these would be things you can research. So to sum it all up, you can get school work done efficiently. You can interact with people all over the world. You can also learn about the world around you and that covers less than a fraction of everything you can do on the computers, but don't stay on all day. Make sure you go outside and have a great time too!
1087	1089	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I have some questions for you and I was hoping you could answer them. I was wondering. Do you have any computers in your house, if so how many? Also, do you like using the computer? I am trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because I want to ask them how do they survive without one!? Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer. You can talk, email, even see people through a computer because nowadays everyone has a webcam hooked onto their computer. I want to tell you all of the great things computers do to make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone; like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time you're going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen-name to text someone or just go on verizon, at&t, sprint... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed a number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restaurant or place on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on historical, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers help us everyday with communication and information. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything. Most of someone's life can be saved to the computer. If you have bad handwriting, then you could just type up your paper and hand it in all nice and neat. Like I said before computers are essential to our present day lives and @CAPS3 reading this, I bet you'll agree.
1088	1090	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about computers is that they benefit people. They help people when they need it, and it gives people entertainment. So that is why computers benefit people. @CAPS1 first reason is that a computer can help people when they need help like for instance if you have to write a paper and you need to look something up such as research you can use the computer or if there is a long math equation then you can look up the formula. So as you can see that is why computer benefits people. @CAPS1 second reason is that it gives people entertainment, such as myspace, or twitter. And those are social networks; if you like to watch tv or listen to music there are websites for them also. So that is why I said computers give you entertainment too. @CAPS1 third reason is that it helps people communicate such as if you have friends in different countries and you can't go see them you can talk to them through instant messaging or web cam. Or if you are home schooled and you don't see other kids your age you can talk to them on the computer. So as you can see that why I say you can connect through the computer. So as you can see that is why I say computers are very beneficial because they give you entertainment, they let you communicate and they help people so they are a valuable tool in modern life.
1089	1091	1	3	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People say that technology is affecting everybody left and right. Computers actively help us with our daily lives. It helps us do projects for school, lets us understand culture around the world, and gives us the ability to talk and connect with friends and family everywhere. Our school makes us do tons of projects and the computer is our main resource. If you want to go somewhere far away, you're most likely to research it, and then plan on going. It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook, twitter, and @CAPS3. Computers help us learn and communicate. To start off, as an eighth grader, we are prepared to go to high school. Fortunately, it means we do projects, reports, and research on the computer. The computer enables us to find information for a project, or construct a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people use this method for jobs. People do reports on celebrities and famous people from history. Books can't always give the information you are looking for, so they look up that persons name, and they will find out hundreds of web sites that give information and photographs of that person. In addition to that, computers let you book flights, buy cars, and check tax rates. Sometimes, people don't always want to go and drive to a local car dealer, so they go online to a website that sells, and they are able to look at all of the features of the car, the price, and mileage. The only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet. They have websites that let you book whatever kind of flights you want. It can be to go to florida, or it can be a flight to @LOCATION1. If you also want to know how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and find out how much our country is in debt. You can even find out how much an average family pays every year. Computers can be very resourceful at @CAPS2. It gives capability to do more than you can imagine. Most importantly, computers have created a way for you to talk to friends and family around the globe. Facebook and twitter are the new things of the century. Facebook and twitter let you talk to friends, post photos and talk about your personal life. They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. @CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and doesn't have as many cool things. It only let's you talk to friends and that's why no one uses it anymore. People want to be able to do more than just talk. It comes to my attention that computers have improved over time. Computers these days enable you to talk with friends, do research and projects, and let you book flights and buy cars. Our school's curriculum has many projects and reports. They can be done only by the help of a computer. You can research people and places and or get pictures. You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet. We even have the capability to talk with friends on facebook and twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people and their daily activities.
1090	1092	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending too much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too often. Staring at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. That's one thing kids and adults don't notice. You need your brain cells for school, jobs, and other activities. Computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework, which should come before the computer. Time flies by as you're clicking and typing. The next thing you know it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school, I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I can meet my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer. The @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to receive oxygen is going outside for some exercise and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, ""Everyone should have at least an hour of exercise a day."" You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you haven't seen in a while, you don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family; get away from the computer and bond with the people who matter most."
1091	1093	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much. Well, I disagree with this statement. I think the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, a skill developed through regular use. The computer also lets you learn more about foreign people and places, broadening your understanding of the world. Lastly, computers help you communicate with others, connecting you instantly. As recently stated, I think computers are useful because they help with your hand-eye coordination. For example, when you write papers for school or a document for work, you're using that coordination. You didn't even notice how once you get the hang of typing, you tend to move faster and more accurately. This machine is a beautiful invention please don't take @CAPS1 away! The computer is also central to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people. Another thing that you don't realize when using a computer is that the information you get comes from someone not in your immediate area but from long distance places. How would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas? The computer is the quickest way to find out information, providing answers in seconds. Finally, the computer is an important resource because you can chat with your friends online. A @CAPS2 researcher showed that computers facilitate this. You can chat @CAPS3, making it easy to stay in touch. I think computers have positive effects on all! They teach hand-eye coordination, they teach you about far away places, and the computer lets you chat online with your friends! I hope @CAPS4 you see the computer the way I do, as a vital and beneficial tool for modern life.
1092	1094	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the majority of people now possesses computers. Computers have greatly advanced society and technology, becoming integral to our daily routines. Some people say that computers have negative effects, but that is not true. Computers have influenced people in many beneficial ways, enhancing how we work and learn. Although some experts want people to use computers less, that technology is required in schools for various tasks. Kids are told to type their papers, which lets them finish faster and more neatly. This faster finish can lead to kids not staying up too late, reducing stress. Then doing homework becomes more efficient. That is better for their health and well-being. Computers also develop hand-eye coordination which is an essential skill for later in life, useful in many professions. In my opinion computers have greatly contributed to technology, driving innovation forward. They are letting us explore places humans have ever or could ever go, like the depths of the ocean or distant planets. We can make and distribute items much faster, improving productivity. In addition, computers also let people learn about faraway places, about different cultures and different people, fostering global understanding. Computers can expand everyone's horizons and let them know about places and things that they never knew existed, opening up new worlds of knowledge. With one of the largest number of members, Facebook is a website that people use to communicate regularly. More than @PERCENT1 of most students in an average school have one. They communicate there more than they could without computers, sharing updates and photos. Computers aren't making people ""anti social"" or making them interact with friends less, they're actually talking more and maintaining stronger connections. Computers are letting people communicate daily with people from all around the globe, without having to worry about running out of cellphone minutes, making it cost-effective. Overall, computers are letting people broaden their horizons and learn about a lot of new things. They are more of a benefit than a burden, providing countless advantages. Computers are the next best thing since sliced bread, a truly revolutionary invention."
1093	1095	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming too dependant on computers, relying on them for everything. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active, engaging in physical exercise. While some people @MONTH1 think we're not wasting our time on the computer, I @CAPS3 that we often are. I'll should only go on if it is necessary, for work or important research. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people dont realize is that it doesn't only waste their time it wastes our money too. Electricity bills are through the roof from constant use. Also instead of going out to meet @CAPS1 people are staying home and talking on social networking sites which can make them less socially skilled in person. Children are not enrolling in sports which makes them lose any physical strength they would get from playing outside. Also children could be getting over weight by just sitting there with no physical activity, which is a growing concern. @CAPS2 ideas like microsoft word is fine for productivity but going on every day for games is excessive. Teachers, parents, and all adults need to show these kids that the computer is not the only thing in life, that there is a whole world outside. Computers can benefit us very well, by letting us have knowledge of something at the tip of our fingers, which is incredibly convenient. However, computers can and will take away family and friend time if we are not careful. Now I'm not saying that computers are all bad, but what I am saying is that it effects everyone around you, not @CAPS3 just the person that's using it. What @CAPS4 need to @CAPS3 is get together and unite for activities. @CAPS4 need to go outside more, and exercise to stay healthy. @CAPS4 need to stop the computer overuse with adults setting an example. Therefore, lets make this a better place by balancing our time. and get out and have a little time for going on to the computer, ensuring it doesn't dominate our lives.
1094	1096	1	3	I think that we should have computers. Because it help us find people and it help us talk to people and it help you search things too. For instance, I can find a brother that I never knew before; then you can connect with that brother. Then I can talk to my friend online if I go to myspace or @CAPS1 because you can in @MONTH1 have friends on myspace, making it simple to stay in contact. And by searching this way you can find new things and you can look up information like the weather in a different country or state. I can find out how cold it is in Texas right from my home. and you can search and see how old something can be, or how old it can get, satisfying your curiosity quickly and easily.
1095	1097	1	3	Dear fellow citizens, @CAPS1 think if you had to get a book for every question you had. That would take a long time to even get the book let alone read it through. Computers have helped the modern world with questions, long distance friends, and entertainment, making life more convenient. Computers have helped us with more then those things; the @CAPS2 is such a universal thing that its hard to come up with all of the helpful things it does for us daily. For one the @CAPS2 helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them all the time. Sites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 allow us to communicate and/or play with them easily. @CAPS1 think the only way to talk with a friend from a different place would be to pick up the phone and call them, well your friendship would disappear very quickly without regular contact. This would happen because no one ever usually has the time to pick up the phone and talk to the person and do nothing else for a long period. Well when you talk to them on the @CAPS2 you can do other things at the same time, multitasking effectively. For example if I wanted to I could talk to someone on the @CAPS2 and clean my room simultaneously. Furthermore computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or anything else that is entertaining during our free time. On the computer I remember when my brother would let me use it to play games. I was entertained but then I @CAPS1 went and found better options. A computer can also play movies, @CAPS5 shows, and videos from various sources. If you ever miss a show you can go to the website of the show and watch it later at your convenience. This could save someone time and effort from trying to record it. Lastly, The computer is much more efficient in looking up things than traditional methods. It is much faster then looking through the library and you don't have to leave your house to do it. I although people say that the @CAPS2 is taking away time from reading well it really isn't doing that. For everything you want to know you can read articles online or if you really want to you can have the @CAPS2 read the text for you aloud. Reading isn't a problem at all with a computer; it can even enhance it. @NUM1 of america believes that computers help greatly and how they have more time to do things because of them. Technology is being upgraded every day and it keeps getting better and better, offering new features. In conclusion I believe that computers are helping us and is not a bad thing for society. Computers are great for us and good for busy people who need efficiency. Now go and get a @CAPS2 to experience these benefits yourself.
1096	1098	1	3	Dear local newspaper, There are several reasons how computers have an effect on people. My position is to convince the local newspaper why certain people shouldn't and should use computers. People are getting caught up on the internet, or people not having enough money to explore the world, so they just be on the computer. In effect, people shouldn't waste their time on the internet because you will get caught up. For example, my friend stays on the computer more than eight hours. He tells me that he's on a chat line, hooking up with other people. He forgets about everybody. He's so on the computer. He stopped going to school, he is gaining weight. Now he is just a nobody. He just sits in front of his computer and does nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid chat line. It's not hard to find another person in our city. There are a lot of beautiful young ladies out here to explore. Similarly, people shouldn't waste their time on the internet because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop losing their focus on important things, and start paying attention on other things. There was a great person I knew. She was so successful. She made tons of money. Until she started losing her job. She was fired because she was so stuck on Facebook. Facebook is like a place for a friend search; you could meet other people from different cities; you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turned her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so messed up now, how she got fired, how she doesn't pay her bills, and how she is moving into a smaller place. Sometimes websites make you lose focus on important things in life. Consequently, certain people should use computers because the internet can help you with certain things. In summation, it can help you find a hotel or a trip to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the internet. One time I signed up for this website that was called Myspace. For a moment I did get caught up on it. But I learned to use it wisely, for connecting with old friends and planning events. So, while computers can be a trap, they can also be a useful tool when used with care and moderation, which is the point I wanted to make.
1097	1099	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, My opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that they are creating more and more obese people. People tend to get moody, and it seems that computers are addictive. I think computers have a huge effect on people. The number one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit in for most of the day. Also they get so lazy they don't want to get up so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their house. The next idea is that they do not get enough exercise, because they just sit there all day and don't move. But when they do move it is to get something to eat or go get their phone. This is why they should limit kids and adults to only two hours or less of computer time each day. My next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get moody. Like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad. They get all cooped up inside for the whole day. They don't see enough sunlight because people don't see they are indoors too much. If they exercised for one hour each day the moodiness would change. People need a lot of exercise to maintain weight and muscle. My last reason that computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer. Like if they are playing a game all day and don't realize it, they will get addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport. In conclusion, what I am trying to tell you is that it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer, because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a high risk of obesity. So can you please listen to my ideas and consider promoting healthier habits for everyone in our community.
1098	1100	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I have been reading about the debate about computers. People say that computers are teaching important skills. Others are saying that, ""People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising."" Personally, I think that people should be able to use computers; I mean they were meant to help us anyway. Just think how much computers have helped the human race, from talking to friends and family in other countries to looking at what time the plane leaves to another city. It is said that more than one million people and up use their computer more than once a day. Without the computer there is no worldwide web which is connected to everything in this world. Without computers you wouldn't be able to control any robotic equipment which will give more jobs, but the cost of food would go up tremendously; without computers the equipment wouldn't work in hospitals; computers can save lives as they store important information. We would have to go back into the dark ages with typewriters again. Another big issue is that people are overusing the computer. Once you learn to moderate the usage of your computer that won't be a problem. Some people say computers cost too much. There are ways to put so called ""down payments"" on computers, something like a plan where you pay each month, and setting up internet is easy as one-two-three. So, yes there are good and bad things talked about computers but without them we wouldn't have a modern era. They control the robots that make your car, the medical equipment that saves lives, so with all this said I would like to say thanks for listening and go computers for all the progress they bring!"
1099	1101	1	3	Dear Editor, I am writing this article on computers to inform you of my opinion on computers' positive and negative effects. The reason why computers are so successful is because of some of the great information they provide. Such as directions to a place you are going to or home information on a subject or a person. Although these all sound good, anyone can post information on the internet so some information might not all be accurate. Some reasons why the computer is bad is because of sites which are not safe and can give your personal information to a stranger, coming back to bother you in the future. Also, some websites or pop-up icons are not suitable for younger kids, exposing them to content that is too mature for them. Lastly, talking on the computer is a part of our everyday lives, such as emails; almost every American with a computer has one. An email is a great way to relay information quickly. Also, the new source of web cameras is giving you the ability to see people and talk into the computer, which is rapidly growing in the United States and beyond. That is all in this article; this tells you my point of view on computers and their dual nature in our modern world.
1100	1102	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that the computer is not a bad thing because of three reasons. One reason is that we can learn about a faraway place. Another reason is they teach hand-eye coordination. The last reason is we can talk to friends and meet new people. From the computer we can learn about a faraway place if we were doing a report on it or just out of curiosity. We can learn what kind of plants grow there for food; for example, tropical places grow bananas and coconuts. We can learn what they eat; like in Mexico they eat many beans; a lot of their food has beans, even their salads. We can find out their language as well; maybe they talk Spanish like in Spain. You can also teach hand-eye coordination because it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use your hands on everything while typing, whether you are typing or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things; it is also for friends because of all these sites like Myspace, Facebook, AIM, and webchat. The possibilities are endless; you can even play games. If you don't know someone on Facebook or Myspace that's okay; it is a great way to meet new people and new friends. And another thing, if you are having trouble finding a friend you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somewhere or for planning something. And for those people who think it is taking away family time, you can always just say okay that's enough and talk to them. So that is it; computers are good because you can learn about places, develop hand-eye coordination, and talk to new and old friends, making them a valuable part of modern life.
1101	1103	1	3	I believe that the household computer can help with everyday things like research and development, homework, artwork, an always renewing travel dictionary, a twenty-four hour super store filled with never ending items, video games, and a very sophisticated calculator. New programs are coming out all the time, but addiction is always seen as a very bad thing to have. If you become addicted to any part of it, you will start to have no friends or girlfriends and you'll probably start to ignore your family. Furthermore, you'll get carpal tunnel syndrome from typing and eye strain from staring at a bright screen all day and looking at it closely. You will probably get a bad back from sitting all day in a chair or kneeling or leaning back in a chaise lounge; it may be comfy but it's bad for you. In conclusion, computers help a lot and they are fun, but they are addicting too, so have fun. But don't get addicted because computers may be fun, but portions are healthy and that's what should be done.
1102	1104	1	3	Dear Readers, one of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people spend too much time on computers, especially teenagers. They spend too much time on social media and video games, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they may talk with friends with messaging apps, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball. Families also are distant from each other when they sit around on their devices. Teenagers spend too much time on the internet going where they should not instead of doing more beneficial activities like reading. I am sure we all know at least one obese person or teenager. My neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as one. He will sit on the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer screen for hours on end. Sometimes I wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second. I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor. The statistic that thirty percent of America is obese is not exaggerated at all. In my opinion, it is the fault of the internet and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they go to the computer and talk and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless online videos, while they should be playing baseball or football. Doubters say you learn hand-eye coordination with computers, but you can learn better with sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage people to sit around instead of doing standard sixty minutes a day of exercise. The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and adult does. I would say that the average gets about ten minutes of reading a day because they are too busy chatting with friends on the internet. I have a cousin who reads about a book every two years and fails every test he gets and has stayed back three times, but instead of reading and learning, he is chatting and texting. He wastes these excellent educational opportunities while there are people in underdeveloped countries like Africa who are lucky to own a book. I know more than fifty percent of the kids in my class do not read anything except the required reading and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting time. The average reading score is about two hundred and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time on computers spent. I have seen surveys that say three out of four kids spend more than six hours a day on computers. These statistics and quotes have left me thinking, how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading or else we will turn into oversized monkeys who can't even read. The computers and internet are doing more than just erasing brain cells and our health, they are taking away the experiences that we could have outside in nature. Nature holds natural wonders like the Grand Canyon, the Rocky Mountains and the Great Barrier Reef. What beats skiing down a large slope, or climbing Mount Everest, certainly not computers. Unfortunately, that is what most people choose to do. They sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches. They sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens, unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves. Instead of taking steps to help the environment we are sitting on the computers sleeping and being mesmerized by the light of the screen. We should be preserving and learning about what is left on the planet, but we are not because of these computers and the internet. I have presented a strong argument against computers that you may listen to or not. I strongly urge you to take action to start reducing time spent on computers. Set up programs at your house or town for turning off the computers. We need to do something now!
1103	1105	1	3	"Dear editor, last week, I noticed an article in the paper headlined ""Get off the computer and go exercise."" This caught me off guard because there are many benefits to computers, such as it enhances education, you can learn about foreign countries, and you can talk to other people. Every school has a computer. They have easy access and are very helpful. I know that last year, if someone asked a question and the teacher wasn't sure of it, we would go straight to the computer. It also helps us do better on projects. I know I had to do a project last month, and without the computer I wouldn't have it today. We also use the computers for the programs they have. In art, we made a cartoon, and made it look real with Photoshop. It's also easy and fast to use a computer for research. You can also learn about far away places with a computer. For example, you can find out about other countries in the world. You could find out if it were landlocked, not landlocked, how many people live there, and facts similar to those. You can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government. Finally, you can also learn up-to-the-minute facts with websites like Wikipedia.com. Lastly, you can talk with other people using email, instant messaging, and websites like Facebook, which allows you to connect with friends. With email, you talk with someone for business, to receive links to important websites, and to share information. Instant messaging is just like texting on your phone, except much faster. You can instantly talk to people and catch up with them. Thousands of people are on Facebook. You can connect with old friends, and talk to current ones. I know my mom uses Facebook and talks to old friends since she moved. So, in my opinion, I think computers are a good thing to have. Not only do they enhance your education, but they also teach us foreign countries' history and let us connect to old friends. When you were in school, do you remember your ""best-friend-for-life?"" Well, with Facebook you can catch up with them, instead of them being just a memory."
1104	1106	1	3	Dear Editor of the Gazette, did you know that eight out of ten homes in our town have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benefit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless possibilities for how they can benefit our society. Many people don't realize that some families cannot be with each other so easily as others. If a family member is in the service sometimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to communicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benefit is a lie. For others who don't have such a severe need of communicating it is still a convenient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an alternative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is definitely a benefit to communication. The computer can also make many tasks much easier; for example, if you were assigned a five-page essay in school, typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many businesses rely on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program Excel, Microsoft created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than having everything in different sites with millions of papers in every drawer. So another benefit of the computer is that it can keep things organized and provide easy ways to complete everyday tasks. Maybe the greatest benefit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curious about the recent earthquake in Japan, if I wanted more information I would head straight to the computer. You simply go to Google or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips; this is definitely a huge benefit to our society. The computer is a wonderful tool that can assist in so many ways, whether it is communication, organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve everyday life. Computers don't just benefit our little town of Springfield, they benefit our whole society in all of the amazing things they do.
1105	1107	1	3	Computers are good and bad. They are good because that is a way we can communicate with other people in different states, keeping in touch with family and friends across long distances. Another reason computers are good is because they can keep you out of trouble by providing constructive activities and can keep you entertained with various games and media. However, computers are bad because they can lead to addiction; you can become a computer freak and become hyper-focused when it comes to computers, neglecting other responsibilities. Still, computers are good because they can do a lot of things that other objects cannot do, offering unique tools and resources. In the end, it is all about finding a healthy balance in their use.
1106	1108	1	3	Dear local newspaper, As you can see, about seventy percent of our population overuse the computer. They should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends. On the other hand, the computer can come with much use for many people. Family lives quite a distance away, and as well, some friends are getting out of touch is a possibility. You can also learn about far away places, like Paris. The computer is often used for projects and essays which is important. You can learn quite a bit with a computer. The computer can be used in many ways. One way is to keep in contact. Sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody lives that close. For people who have relatives or even good friends who live quite a distance, a computer is what you need. It is a great way to keep in contact. You can keep everyone updated at all times. For example, my cousin recently went out of the country for college; she will be there for a few months so she has her own blog on the computer to keep everybody updated and stay in contact. The phone is not always an option. To learn about far away places is great. Online you can learn about the history of specific places. You can see the towns and so much more. You can even see pictures. Maybe one day you will even get to see those specific places in person. How cool would that be? School is a big thing now-a-days. Students have project after project, essay after essay and its a lot of work. As you grow older it becomes more work and with a computer, you will have less weight on your shoulders. With essays you can type them, and fix your mistakes without it looking sloppy. Projects are easy to fix too, so messing up isn't a big deal. On the other hand, more Americans now than ever before are overweight. The computer has a lot to do with that. Most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening. They don't realize what a big effect a computer can make on a person. More people should be out exercising and spending time with family. Computers can be a negative thing or a positive. It can be more helpful than you could imagine. But, yet it can make a huge negative effect on people. It can help keep contact with people, to learn about far away places, or even with school work. Let it be beneficial; use it when you need it, but remember to step away and enjoy the world outside your screen.
1107	1109	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers benefit society because they teach people. They are also helpful because they solve problems that humans might have trouble with. They can also entertain us when we have nothing to do. They can teach people many things. They can help tourists learn about a location they wish to travel to. Actually, eight out of every ten tourists research the area they're going to on a computer. They help students catch up or fully understand something. One time I was having trouble with fractions in math. So I decided to look up the way to find the answer and it caught me up with the class again. The computer can explain cultures from anywhere in the world. According to culturedigest.com, ninety percent of people visiting a new country find out about the culture first. Computers solve problems that some people might not know about. It can solve a math problem easily with a built-in calculator. Seven out of ten computer users have used a calculator to help them solve a problem. They also solve geographic problems. There may be an abundance of dated maps but this is easily solved with live satellite maps. Map Tools says there has never been a flaw in their system. Computers have a wide variety of entertainment. They can play music. Eighty-five percent of teens get their music from the computer over a CD. Computers can entertain you with games. One day it was raining hard and I had nothing to do so I went on my computer and played Minesweeper. This kept me very entertained. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for your time and for considering the many ways computers positively impact our daily lives and learning.
1108	1110	1	3	More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Well, to me it does benefit society in many ways like learning online. You can learn many things online; you can practice math, reading, and even writing. You can also have fun online if you're bored at home and have nothing to do. Also, you can interact with friends and family members, by email etc. When you're online you can learn a lot of things. If you're at home, and you need to study for a test, you can go online and study. You can also learn more, because you can learn how to do a math problem if you don't know it, or just catch up on reading. People sometimes need a computer because they might be bored, so they can go online and play games and have fun. People, especially kids, get bored at times, so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivia so they can still learn. Computers can let you interact with your family and friends. You can e-mail or use a webcam. If you haven't talked to someone a long period of time you can just go to the computer and talk to them. If you want to find a former school classmate that you haven't talked to in years, you can now. Computers do benefit the society. In my own opinion we do need computers. If parents do not want their child on websites they don't approve of, the parents can always block those websites. Computers are really necessary; they can help in a huge way with education, communication, and entertainment, making them a valuable tool for modern life.
1109	1111	1	3	Being a teen myself, my computer is something I don't think I would be able to live without. But is it holding me back from more important things? I think so. I feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now. For example with school research papers we immediately go to the computers in order to find information when we could be using books and magazines. With having the use of computers many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books. Also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment. For many people using a computer is a life style, it's something we tend to use more than religiously and that may not be the best thing. Children, teens and even adults get extremely addicted to computers. Teens and children use laptops and iPads everyday in order to do their school work, and to talk with friends. As well as parents/adults, they use it to get their work done and use it as an easy communication with co-workers. To this very day people have become very addicted to computers. I know for certain that in my family, my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. As I mentioned before computers are also pulling families further apart. There is less family time and communication between family members these days, due to computers. Instead of spending time with the family, teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends. I bet if a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers I almost guarantee it would be quite a large amount. I know the only true family time some families have without computers is dinner and that isn't much. Lastly many humans are not as connected to nature and as involved as they used to be. Using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature. Though there are many advertisements and pop ups on the computer that inform us about how to take care of the earth properly, we so easily ignore them and remain playing on the computer than going outside and doing something to help make the world a better, clearer place. Not only is it just taking care of our earth, but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should. Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but I bet a great deal of it is. Like I said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer, I mean how would we communicate or do our work? But there are truthfully other ways to do them that we just aren't very used to because of the fact that we are so attached to them. I never really noticed till now that it is possible to live without a computer, and that so many people are missing incredible things such as family and nature because we are so addicted to the computers, and it is a realization worth considering for a more balanced life.
1110	1112	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion I believe that computers have helped our society a lot over the past decade or so. This is because when you are on the computer you get better hand-eye coordination. Also you learn how to type and do other things with a computer that you will need to know how to do if you want to get a decent job that pays well. Also now on the computer you can go on Facebook and other websites where you can make friends and chat with other people. So its not only helping your social skills and hand-eye coordination but also you are most likely to get a good job if you know how to type and use a computer. First off, having a computer teaches you to have better hand-eye coordination. This is because when you get a computer having better hand-eye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quickly. Secondly, having a computer will teach you better social skills. This is because now a lot of people go on Facebook and you can make friends and chat with your new ones. Also when its a cold and rainy day you can occupy yourself by playing different games and also you can check the news and forecast for tomorrow's weather. Lastly, when you learn how to type you have a good shot at getting a good job because you know how to type and work a computer. This is because when you are looking for a job that pays good you will most likely have to know how to type and operate a computer. Indeed, in conclusion, in my opinion I think computers have helped our society over the years, but other people may think differently. So now lets see what you think about the role of computers in our modern world.
1111	1113	1	3	"Click, click, click the mouse of a computer goes as you are searching throughout the internet. Computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intelligent, and help you with your homework, I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can teach kids to be social because first off computers are like an online phone, you can talk to people in so many ways, facebook chat, aim(chat), myspace, twitter, skype, and a lot of other ways that I haven't mentioned. Also I think if a teen or kid or even adult that is too nervous to talk to people on the phone or in person, and is socially not there or painfully shy can start off by just chatting with people online. Once they feels more comfortable, then they can start talking to the person on the phone or in person. For example, I once met this girl who was very sweet, but was painfully shy and everyone judged her for it, so one day she decided to make an aim and talk to people on it, and prove that she isn't an annoying weird girl that everyone makes her out to be. She turned out to be one of the nicest, funniest person I have hung out with in a while. Which shows how internet can help you. Have you ever felt that computers sometimes make you more intelligent? Well, in my opinion I think that computers help out so much more than a book. If you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button. Having a computer is like your own personal handbook of everything in the world. A lot of people these days study from the internet, I know I sure do. Statistics show that many more people say, that computers are more helpful than books and can make you a lot more intelligent, because the internet has so much more detail than books, and more facts. A large percentage of kids that have a computer use it for homework. Computers is a great tool to use while you are doing your homework. I spend most of the day on my computer doing homework than off it. For example, say you have a report and you need facts on a famous person, and where he was born. You would just type in, ""when was this person born."" and boom! There it is with the date exactly. Also if you are having a piece of writing like your rough draft so why spend the time trying to write really neat and perfect? When you can just open up a word document and type it up. To sum everything up computers have definitely a positive effect on people from these three reasons, computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intelligent, and help you with your homework, But I understand where your coming from people are spending way to much time on their computer and less time exercising, but you can look up great ways to exercise on the internet and watch videos of people that have television shows about exercising and do it with them on the computer. Remember, computers aren't just a waste of time and way to kill your brain cells. they have a very positive effect on you."
1112	1114	1	3	"Dear School Board Members, I am here to persuade you to agree with me on, that the use of computers does benefit society. Some reasons why I think this are school work and business stuff. Also the over all research on important things. My first reason why I think that computer use is benefiting society is because the internet is oftenly used for school work. In example use the internet for projects and assignments. Also some type of research they might be interested in for their classes. But one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because, there are a lot of people taking online classes. Whether its for college or for the sake of your own learning. This is why I think school work should be a valid reason for benefiting society. My second reason why I think the internet benefits our society is the business or job part of the computer. Many people, nowadays work at home, they have their own office. They almost create their own company. Another reason is many people also use word processing or publisher for their professional tasks. A significant percentage of the people who work at public businesses do this, going along with ads, which could also be another reason for this. But then again, you could also pay your bills on line! I remember when I helped my mother pay one of the bills online, and let me tell you, ""it was easy!"". My mother said she would do it more often now that she knows how to use it! So the business side should be more then enough, for me to convince you. My last reason is over all research on all important things. Some of these important things are: online catalogs, the news and another one the most important things of all job openings. I know my self, and I love to shop! So instead of leaving the house, I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store. The main reasons why I go online is because they have more variety and sizes available. As for the news, thats all for my parents because I don't watch the news. Lastly, job openings now that I am older, I would like to find a job, even if its minimum wage. It's still something, right? This should be a high priced reason for agreement! In conclusion, I think my reasons are very well clear; school work, business, and over all research. If these reasons don't convince you I don't know what will!"
1113	1115	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Meet a family. Just a normal family whose lives have been changed due to computers. They are overweight, constantly suffering from fatigue, lonely, nature deprived and lazy. However, they could of turned out differently if they just shut down their computers. They might of been healthy, fit, energetic, radiant, hardworking people if they had stopped spending hours on the computer daily. Although there are some positive aspects, computers can be dramatic. They isolate you from friends and family, they deprive you of the nature around you, and most of all, they can cause you to become overweight or even obese. Friends and family are two very important things in everybody's life, even if you dont realize it. By using computers rather than interacting with them, you are weakening the connections you have. Computers can cause you to isolate yourself. They might cause you to talk to your family less. Unfortunatley, friendships can be lost this way. ""Spending long hours on my computer had caused me to become isolated and made me fell lonely,"" says a teenager, by reducing the use of computers you are doing yourself a favor. Computer can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you. You most likely would be on your computer rather than going outside. Instead of spending countless hours on the computer, you could be playing a sport or activity. By playing sports you are increasing your hand eye coordination, far more then if you were to be on a computer. Wouldnt you like to be having fun with your friends playing volleyball, basketball, swimming or even going for a walk rather then sitting in front of your computer? I know I would! The obesity rates of this country will increase if people continue to use computers. You will risk a significant rise from lack of exercise. Computers can ruin lives by increasing your chance of becoming unhealthy and overweight. So now think, would you want to be lonely, overweight, and deprived of nature? I know i definitely wouldn't. That is why computers should be used less frequently! So now is the time; lets join together and raise awareness of the negative effects of computer!"
1114	1116	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reason why I am against usage of computers. My first reason why I am against usage of computers is, the negativity, like for example too many pop ups come on the website your on and then they are mini little advertisments like ""click on me"" or ""free trial"". And thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My second reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. A large number of people use the computer every single day and many of them be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they are older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called ""predators"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier thats not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is monitoring, a lot of parents dont watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inappropriate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fault because they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dont always know what your clicking on and you can click on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. So just consider my opinions and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks for your time."
1115	1117	1	3	"Statistics show that more and more people every year are not getting their exercise and are on the computer talking to their friend on face book or my space or something like that. Will people go out side more or will they sit and type? Here is the problem: more and more people use computers, but not every one agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on peoples life. Well I personally believe that it does not have a positive effect on people. My reasons are that people who use computers more dont get their exercise and get fatter, and if you put Your name and address on the computer their is a slight chance that you will be kidnapped or murdered, my final reason is that you dont spend as much time with the family that you should. Obesity in the country has gone up at least significantly because people arent getting their exercise and are spending to much time on the computer daily. One source says that: ""Their are too many People who dont get the exercise They need."" A safety organization says ""Many people like the internet but what people dont know is that their are many bad people out their who would like to get their hands on your info."" So as you can see I personally believe that it would be a wise idea if you wrote a article on technology. Because with obesity in america and online safety it is now or never that You write this article it will probably make you hundreds of dollars. So get out your notepad, pick up your pencil and write. Many people think that Computers are fun yes but You are not realizing what Your doing. You could be a certain weight one day and then be much heavier the next. So remember that it would not be a bad thing if you wrote a article on this important topic."
1116	1118	1	3	"@CAPS1, @CAPS1 boom, bom! Those are the noises of pinball on my computer. @CAPS2! Yea we won"". Those are noises you don't want to be hearing all day. Always being on your computer is bad for your health. @CAPS5 you are a computer freak you will become overweight, it's bad for your eyes, and you can't enjoy beautiful nature. ""@CAPS3 you want to be so heavy that you can't even lift yourself out of bed? I don't think so. @CAPS5 you are always sitting at the computer desk then you might be like that. @PERCENT1 of doctors say that @CAPS5 you don't get up from the computer desk you will become obese! Being obese is terrible for your health. It can take years off your life. @CAPS5 you want to live a long healthy life you need to get up from the computer and exercise. ""@CAPS4 I think I need a stronger prescription, my eye are getting worse! @CAPS5 something like this has ever happened tp you it's because your your eyes to at the computers screen all day. @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS5 you are at the computer all the time you will need glasses or a stronger prescription."" @CAPS6 and children need to get away from their computers. studies show that more adults are on computers, playing games than children. Have fresh, healthy eyes and get away the computer. The acroos your chill. in your right ear. The sun giving you the most beatiful tan. @CAPS3 you like the sound of this? Take away from your computer and go outside. This is the amazing experience you can get from going outside. @CAPS5 you sit at the computer screen maybe you can watch someone else enjoying the great, relaxing experience you shoud have. Get up, get active and go outside. Now is the time to get up from your computer. @CAPS5 you haven't learned, the computer is an unhealthy thing for humans to use. Be like me and get rid of your computer. You need to be healthy and most of all active. Have good eyes and enjoy nature. Don't use the computer."
1117	1119	1	3	Currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. Some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. However, I tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. People exploit most of their time on comptuers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? Many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism. This is one reason why the @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pair you'll recieve, you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercise. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we @MONTH1 learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our frinds in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1. Our families need help occasionally, but sometime we're not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. In conclusion, computers hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends.
1118	1120	1	3	Dear editor, I have heerd about me advance in technology dispute. I would like to say their I think it does benef it our society. I think this because: You can communicate with friends, they help you with school and a reliable resource for you need to find. Please read on so I can explain my reasons. Computers and technology benefit us in many ways. One of mom's they able you to talk to friends. Computers give you an easy and fast way to communicate with others. Instead of sending a boring letter that takes forever to get there, you can hook up with your friends, you haven't seen in a while. I remember when my friend moved to @LOCATION1. It would of taken me forever to there, so instead I went online and talked to him. Also, lastly, it less your hand. Now please read on for my second reason. My second reason . Computer are a of looking in many different take days. You can go online and find everyone, in ten minutes. In fifth grade I had to do this really hard project. I looked in books @NUM1 days and find. But then looked up everything I needed to known in an half hour. Lastly, they have more success. If you go on in @ORGANIZATION2 you could find hundreds of on one topic. Easy right? New read on for reason. My last and strongest reason that technology can help you find anything in everyday life. Computers can help you find your way. They supermarket for you. They can help with anything. One year I went on vacation to @LOCATION2. my mom move. So got lost help. Na, if we gotten difference have nevir pickel. Wouldn't you be more confident if you had ? Computers can a lso find for places for you an your friends or family to have fun like it couldn't find places never heard of. Such as @ORGANIZATION1. Now need on so can all up. So, as you can see technology, benefits our society in a big way. Mostly in these three reasons: You can communicate with your friends, they help you in school, and they are a reliable source for everybody life. i hope you have enjoyed rading this. Please take this info your next . thank you for your time, and thank you for reading my paper.
1119	1121	1	3	In my opinion i think that computers help people. It helps them with imformation that they @MONTH1 need. It can also help learn a lot of things. For example, if you need to know about history or science, you can find it quickly online. Computers make it easier to do homework and complete projects for school. They are a useful tool for finding answers and learning new skills. This is why I believe computers are helpful for everyone.
1120	1122	1	3	I believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a stronger positive one. Computers these days are very advanced and allow you to talk to your friends, allow you to acess information more efficiently, and have increased our man power in scientific research. Almost every teen has a screen name that allows you to chat online with your friends. This function keeps kids in touch and active. Eventhough instant messaging can distract kids from their daily life it can also be amazingly helpful. Just last week a friend of mine had forgotten to write down their homework and easly contacted online. I was able to let them know @NUM1 a matter of seconds. Like wise, with this online communication you can also talk and and video chat as if you right there with your friends not everyday do you get to go hang out with your friends so this is an easy alternative. Not only is quick and easy it's free. Computers keep kids off their phones and from jucking up the bill and causing those loud annoying phone bill conversations how to limit your texting. The most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information. The internet allows people to acess millions of websites and light speed. Every second of the day their is someone on the internet searching for date that they would have to go to the library to get. Computers are a key part in society and we depend on them without them we would all be lost. They provide an easier way to life that us lazy @CAPS1 need to survive. The internet keeps us updated and informed on whats going on all around the world without even going there. We need the internet and we couldn't acess it without computers. One of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research. Computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date. Recently I was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for @CAPS2 a process that would take a human weeks. They also help us be different and more creative people. With the computer came smaller more compact computers till they were able to fit in the palm of our hand. They have lead us to think we can do greater things in life and keep our earth safe and to stop damaging it as much. They're lead us to research the unknown areas of the world where @NUM2 years ago a scientist with a pad of paper didn't have dare to even think about. Computers have linked the world through communication and information and have exelled us to greater heights in understanding how we came to be. Overall society needs computers and they have and overwhelming positive affect on society.
1121	1123	1	3	Many computers that people have they use it everyday right? Most of them be on it from the time they get off of work or out of school until it's time for them to go to bed, which can amount to six hours or more. What I think they should to is find some other activity to do instead of sitting on the computer for six hours and not doing nothing with their life, just staring at a screen. And plus at that when you look at a computer for so long you can mess up you eye sight, causing strain and headaches. Why be on the computer all day when you can go outside and get some fresh aire and feel the sun? Why would you wanna be on the computer when you have family and some friends you could be spending time with and taken care of, building real relationships? You don't want to be lazy and not do nothing for yourself, becoming inactive and dependent. You wanna be able to go for a walk or a run instead of being cooped up in the house on the computer all the time. Why would you even wanna be on the computer when you could have fun going out to eat or to an place you always have wanted to go your whole entire life, creating memories? You can't always depend on a computer when you wanna go out and explore something new you have to try it out yourself to really see whats the whole thing about, to experience it firsthand. You don't want to have a boring life now do you, just watching others live? Cause that's what it seems like by you sitting around on the computer everyday looking of a bunch of @NUM1-since you wanna do what you want to do and have fun by doing what you like to do, but it's not real living. It's not easy finding a job or planing to go out far away by looking on the computer because you have to click a lot of numbers or pictures to go threw what you wanna get to when you can go and do it yourself by looking for better and other things to do in the real world, taking direct action for a more fulfilling life.
1122	1124	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do comently. People will be doing much better things, such as exercising or spending more time with family and friends. Both these things are better for people's body and mind, and one more useful later in life, providing long-term benefits. Please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on computers. First, exercising is an exellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer. By cutting out at least some @ORGANIZATION1 these hours, people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine, improving their physical health. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 says that ""@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" @CAPS2 some free time being on the computer is taken away, people will reward themself by taking care @ORGANIZATION1 their bodies through physical activity. Moreover, I tried not using my computer for a week, and it was a great experience because in that free time I learned how to do a back flip in gymnastics, a new skill. There are so many possibilities in exercising @CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much, from sports to simple walks. Second, @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on the computer, they get more experience with social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 says ""@CAPS2 people spend time with family and friends, they gain necessary social skills for later in life, like communication."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick-thinking skills compared to heavy users. Spending time with people's family and friends in stead @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer is exremely beneficial for emotional well-being. I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them as a result. Clearly, it is better to spend less time on the computer, and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends. Some people @MONTH1 say people can talk to people online so this is social skills, but in fact people gain better social skills from person-to-person interactions because they must use quick thinking and their emotions too, reading body language and tone. Altogether, I strongly believe spending less time on the computer is the best way to stay heathy mentally and physically, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. Thank you for considering my opinion."
1123	1125	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 recently has been brought to my attention that computers have been affecting peoples daily lives. i do agree with this because with our countries of obesity rates rising. More people need to exercise more, interact with freinds, and to just enjoy things that don't involve technology for a healthier lifestyle. Some people are just super glue to computers, but let's see if @CAPS3 doesn't start wearing down after this paper, convincing you to change. Many individuals are spending too much on their computer and less time working out or exercising, leading to health issues. People need to start spending more time on exercising and less time on their computer due to the facts that more and more states obese percents just keep rising, a serious concern. Yes, you @MONTH1 say I will just go on a diet ino! Diets don't always work and many people have tned them and failed. Even a simple one hour walk with your dog is better than lazily browsing the web, getting your body moving. And if you wanted, you could even join the local gym for @MONEY1 a month, an affordable option. Buttle only way this is going to happen is by you wanting to do so, making a personal commitment. Now you know how to fix your problem, get going and take that first step! More people need to interact with friends instead of going on their computer for real connection. Interacting with friends or family will help themm be better with their social hucs in all situations. Yes, maybe your friends and family out and hungry with your friends most likely you will have more fun exercising then you have on the computers, making it enjoyable. By interacting with friends and family will help youn later in life by being more social and ready any job interview to meet you less nervous and more confident. F inally, enjoying things that don't involve technology is good to know because many people don't have as much fun out in the real world, missing out. You have to mete @CAPS3 fun yourself by seeking it out. This can be schevered by asting a frend to go on a compy trip with ypu or spending a little diugh to enjoy yourself, creating experiences. The ourdoors and nature consists of many beautiful and awesome things; but the only way to realize this id to have fun outside or explore whats the great tourst attractions near you. In conclusion, many people's lives are being manipulated by computers and destroying their daily live, but maybe due to these essy tips; excrsing more, by soul and body, you can reclaim a healthier and more active life.
1124	1126	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too, connecting globally. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer, a essential skill. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files for public safety. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too, enhancing education. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time for learning. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me, which was efficient. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me about their importance. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world from your home. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now, staying informed. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type, increasing productivity. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world, making it a vital tool. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online easily. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam, seeing them face-to-face. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight, providing quick help. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday, sharing the moment. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me on their value for communication. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online, making them indispensable in modern life.
1125	1127	1	3	"The use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented, becoming widespread. Although there are some upsides to computers like doing research and interacting with people, there are @CAPS1 more bad aspects then good ones when it comes to computers, impacting health and safety. Computers negatively affect the way people live outside the ""virtual world,"" reducing real-life experiences. @CAPS1 people end up overweight or obeise from spending too much time in a computer chair and not enough time outside exercising, leading to poor fitness. People also tend to interact with people on the computer that they don't talk to out in the world, or that they don't know at all, which can be isolating. People also give out personal information to people they don't know, which leads me to my second point about security risks. Thefts happen everyday across the globe, whether it's robbing a bank, a store, or even someone's identity, a serious crime. Using a computer can lead to @CAPS1 thefts through online scams. There are people that hack into people's banking account, which has all your personal information on it, and withdraw any sum of money tha they like, causing financial loss. Millions of people have all of their information online, for anyone to see, and this is very dangerous for privacy. That is another downside to computers, the vulnerability. My final point that is to be made is all the costs that come with computers, both financial and personal. @CAPS1 people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time, straining their eyes. Some people even must pay for rehab to recover from addiction. There are people out there who are actually addicted to the internet, so they have to pay thousands of dollars to get back to health, a heavy burden. As you can see, there are @CAPS1 more cons than pros when it comes to computers, posing significant risks. Any of these things could happen to you so I advise you not to use a computer excessively to protect your well-being and security."
1126	1128	1	3	"Do computers hurt your fate and your exercise? I think that a computer couldn't help you in many careers. If you say it is good for you, then it is what you want and there is no need to argue. So let's get to their argument. Well, owning a computer can take you away from exercise and that is not good for you. The more time you spend on it, the more you'll put into it. You'll get addicted, so yes, owning a computer can help and it can't, but most importantly it can't. I mean if you're a business guy you'll need one. But if you get addicted with all the things you can do, before you know it your day has gone by. And you have nothing left, it's the right you could have and have nothing to do, that's rude. What to do now? Let you on the computer again. And the day, the thing is, it's stuff to get off it. Why go out when you could chat with friends online? I'll tell you, you do anything, you go to the kitchen and time a couple of snacks, then you have more and more food and you eat them, then you go swimming and you are fat to all your friends. What's worse, exercising gets you in work you are amused. To we them because of that addicting computer. And so your friends notice and wonder. Next they ask how it happened and you say, ""I was on my computer too much and got fat from a lack of exercise and ate unhealthy."" Then they invite you to do activities and, recently, you get back to your six-pack sexy self. You feel so good about yourself now. You are hot and not amazed, life's good, but the computer you don't have to use it just for what you have to do, not what you want to do. If you want to chat with your friend, go to a place out. Have fun instead of being a no-life at home. This is why you should only use technology if you have to, so your body can stay healthy and in shape just like you want your body to be, no, just like you need your body to be!"
1127	1129	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, This era is all about computers. Computers are a benefit to have. It increases the hand-eye coordination, talking skills, and easy knowledge. My first paragraph is about hand-eye coordination. This is an important skill because it helps with physical movements, using your hands for example. Studies have shown that a significant number of children have improved hand-eye coordination. Also, it helps kids in that it stimulates the nerves in the hands and brain for kids that have had surgery on their hands. Last year's study has shown that a large percentage of kids have improved hand movement faster than regular therapy. Secondly, the importance of computers has been communication like email or instant messaging. This is great for pen pals because it saves time for responses from mail and money because there is no mailing to places and when you email them there will be a fast response. Also, this will help people that are shy around others. A study has shown that many shy kids have increased their talkative skills in school. Also, most talkative skills will help kids today with their confidence. Finally, the computer is a helpful knowledge tool to use. Most books will be more challenging to find because there is always extra information that is not needed and will take longer to find. With a computer all you need to do is to type in what info you're looking up. ""It is an easy sensation,"" said Time magazine. That was one great comment from Time. In school however there are helpful tips that are making it eager and easier to find with bookmarks that you can find that are faster because all there is to do is go up to bookmarks and find the website and click and that's it. In conclusion, the era of computers is becoming more popular by the hour, and the benefit of the computer includes improved hand-eye coordination, better talkative skills, and easier access to knowledge."
1128	1130	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I disagree with the whole computer thing. I think it's just a waste of money and it's a waste of time for kids. The kids will get fat and kids will never want to go outside; they will want to play video games and eat junk food. If you stay on the computer for too long, it can make your eyes weak and it sometimes can give you cancer and you can die from cancer or you can get really sick and not die and you will hike through many sick years of pain. Mostly kids stay on the computer for hours playing stupid games and they will never go outside and they will stay inside for days and never go outside and play with their friends. When they get sick of their games they will want to try and hang out with their friends but they won't be able to; they will be too fat and slow. My aunt died from using a computer too much; she had brain cancer and she died; she lived for several years with the cancer. I felt so bad for my cousin; he had to watch his mother die all because she used a computer every day because that was her job. Therefore I state that computers should not be used for more than a couple of hours a day to protect our health and our lives.
1129	1132	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are unimportant to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top three reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information on a project. You can go on Wikipedia to help find information about the Battle of Gettysburg and other important history. One example is I went to American history.com to find good information about Printer's Alley and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping a lot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online rather than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from Amazon.com so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There were my three main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, attend online schools, and use online shopping stores. This can help people understand and appreciate the value of computers in our modern world.
1130	1133	1	3	Dear Daily News editors, hello, my name is John, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the technological item to have over the past decade or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! However some experts believe that people spend too much time on computers, and that people are not as active or healthy because of it. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society? A large percentage of adults are employed, and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs, or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work much more work can be done, with programs like Microsoft Word people can type reports, and with programs like Excel, people can calculate taxes faster, so they have more time to work. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! You can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell, without raising your phone bill from calling the brokers. Laptops make work possible on the go too! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs, and other skills you might need at times in life. You can learn typing, work programs, and programming which are all needed in some lines of work. Computers increase math skills and hand-eye coordination too! And you can read your favorite books via online scans! Now you might be wondering why not pick up a real book? Well, you can find online scans, and some are free! Not only do computers teach skills and work, they are very fun too! Between Facebook, Twitter, email, and Skype, there are lots of ways to talk to friends and meet new people. On Facebook I can have up to many people talk to whenever I want! Why not talk to real people? you ask, well the answer is simple, maybe it is a lazy Sunday and nobody wants to go out anywhere, or maybe your friends want to talk right before bed time. Talking to real people is important, but can’t be done all the time! Online gaming has become a sensation! So many people are gaming now, that if you're not, you are missing out on an amazing experience. Some people think gaming is a waste of time, but the same can be said for any indoor leisure activity, everybody needs a fun activity they can do anytime! Besides everybody likes having fun! Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making people into fat, lifeless losers, but, it is the opposite, you can socialize online and meet new people. People can balance computers and games, with exercise and sports. With computers you can efficiently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are positive if used correctly. I hope you like this article, thanks for reading and considering my point of view.
1131	1134	1	3	Dear sir, I believe that computers are great for society. There are lots of benefits to having a computer to use. You can talk to people online with instant messaging, which is a lot more dependable than a telephone or cell phone. Lots of times people don't answer the phone when you need them, but with a computer you can send a message from the computer directly to the person's cellular device. You can learn a lot from a computer, such as things about the world and people around the world; you can learn things from the internet your teacher can't even teach you. Then you can study and expand your knowledge independently. It is a problem if you're on the computer more than you exercise, but with technology today you can get exercise while using a computer. You can play music from it while you workout, or watch a movie while running on a treadmill. Even though people go on the computer too much, there are ways to exercise and use the computer at the same time. So there are ups and downs, but in the end, it doesn't matter how much you use the computer because you can get exercise simultaneously, which is why I think it is a benefit to have computers today.
1132	1135	1	3	"Recently, there has been debate about whether or not computers benefit society. Although each side has its own reasons, computers do have a positive effect on people and on society. Computers are beneficial in several ways. With the use of computers, you have the ability to research and learn about foreign and local places, you are able to communicate with others, and they help people complete everyday tasks. At one point in everyone's lives, you need to know about local or even foreign places. It is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about. This is where computers come in. Over the internet, you can research everything from the main staple of the diet in a distant country all the way to the day of the new year in another nation. You learn about things in the comfort of your home, or of your home town. I remember once in fifth grade I had to do a research project on ancient Egypt. By going on the computer, I learned all I needed to know and then some. The project was a breeze, and I got a perfect score. Also, you can learn about local upcoming events, and about the world around you. During childhood, every kid has many questions, some their parents might not be able to answer. Using the computer is a quick and easy way to get these answers. Computers help educate the minds of people and without them, we might not know anything. Communicating with people on the other side of the world is difficult. Mailing a letter could take weeks to reach the recipient. Computers provide us with an immediate method of communicating with others whether they are local or far away. Last year, my uncle moved to another state for work. I never got to see him. We communicated with each other over computers, and when he came home for Christmas, we were as close to each other as we were before he left. Computers kept our relationship healthy and I do not think it would have been that way without them. Scientists say that about eighty percent of all adults have communicated with someone at least once through computers. They also say that half of these people regularly use this method of communicating. Although we still use phones and ""snail mail"", I do not believe that our society would be able to function socially without the available use of computers. Everyday, computers are helping people get through their days with minimal problems. People get things done quicker, giving people more time to do what matters most, interacting with their families. Without computers, everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life. My neighbor, said ""taxes and banking are so time consuming. I do not know that I would be able to handle it without the ability to do my banking online."" In addition to taxes and banking, computers help with everything from shopping to working for the perfect phone company to use for your new business. Having the ability to shop and browse online takes away driving, walking and checkout line time letting you relax and take your time throughout the rest of your day. Typing also gives you hand-eye coordination; without it, you wouldn't be able to do everyday things such as opening the door to playing sports outside with your children. Using computers helps people get through their lives easier and more efficiently, and I could not even imagine life without them. Computers benefit the people of society in every possible way. By helping them obtain knowledge, purifying and strengthening relationships through constant communication ability, and helping make their everyday lives easier, they have a purely positive effect on people everywhere. Computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society."
1133	1136	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, did you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study? I think that people don't spend a lot of time on the computer. And even if they are, it's for studying, learning, or catching up with old friends. Here are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. Most kids use computers to learn about things they are doing in class. And they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on. Also there are games on the computer that can help you with math and other subjects. Now onto my second reason. You can also use the computer to send emails to friends that live far away, and also you could use things like Facebook to find friends that had moved away. And you could also use a video camera to video chat with a friend or if you are a business man or woman you could video chat with clients all across the country. Now onto my third and final reason. Computers also have applications like Microsoft Word which lets you type things such as essays or term papers instead of having to write them out by hand. Also there is an application that lets you make a PowerPoint if you need to make one for a project. And there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures, which is great for art projects. Those are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. If we didn't have computers the world would be very different; kids wouldn't be able to search things for projects or type essays. And you wouldn't be able to keep contact with someone who moved away. Also you wouldn't be able to make PowerPoints for projects or create digital art. And that is why I think computers have a good effect on people.
1134	1137	1	3	Dear Editor, I think computers are one of the most important inventions ever. They help education, make everything easier, and traveling is simpler. It helps education because teachers always use computers to help kids learn important information. For example if we have to study for something there are websites specially made for studying. Also there are sites to teach little kids how to read or write. Almost all schools have computers these days. Some schools even give computers to kids so they can use them to study. A large percentage of teachers in the U.S. use computers more than textbooks and get high test scores. That's why computers help education. A second reason is it generally makes everything easier. For example instead of writing an essay for school and having it take hours until your hand is sore only to find out it's filled with misspelled words, you can type it quickly and use spell check. I have never heard one person say that the computer hasn't made life easier. Another example is if you had to find some information on your new dog. Instead of going to your library spending minutes, you can simply open up your internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds. That's why the computer makes everything easier. The last reason is that traveling is so much simpler with a computer. Without it you have to go to an airport to buy tickets. In fact I don't even remember what it was like to not book travel online with a computer; all you have to do is go to the airline's website and then buy it from there. It's so easy to arrange travel to places, but sending mail is also simpler. I haven't sent a postcard in years. Instead I send email. It is quicker, easier and more reliable. That is why traveling and mail is easier. Overall the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgrading daily soon it will be even easier to do things. While too much computer is bad and people shouldn't only interact with the internet, the computer comes in handy almost all the time. That is why I think the computer is important.
1135	1138	1	3	Dear Editor, There has been lots of talk and arguments about computers and whether they benefit society. I believe it does benefit society. One reason is because you can communicate with others. Another reason is there are many things to do on these computers or even the world wide web. Having computers is always handy. You can talk or web chat with friends. This one time online I found my old friend from elementary school, that I hadn't seen in five years. Whenever I come home from school I'll go on the computer and talk to all my friends. The computer is a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies. My next reason for why they benefit society is there is so much to do. It's like an at-home amusement park. The internet is a wonderful thing, whether to do homework or play games. Even some evenings I'll just sit down for two or three hours and just play a game. But, I still exercise daily. Yes, computers can get addicting but, it's always good to go outside and exercise. Many people say over half of the country's population has a computer, and a significant portion check email or go on the computer every ten minutes. Yes it's not healthy but it's their decision. In conclusion I believe computers are indeed beneficial. I have stated many reasons why, such as they are great for communication or catching up with some friends; also there is an infinite amount of things to do. So if you don't have a computer go out and get one. They will be worth your while.
1136	1139	1	3	"Dear Newspaper Editor, The average American uses the computer at least once every day. These machines definitely benefit society, with them people can easily learn about faraway places, learn without having to carry heavy books and papers, and chat with people all over the country and sometimes even the world. First of all, computers can teach you all about the world without you having to go to a library apart for a book. Free sites like Wikipedia provide fast knowledge on most anything; you can use these sites for essays, trip planning, and just to satisfy your curiosity. Some people believe that computers prevent people from exercising and enjoying nature; however, computers actually promote exercise and going out to look at nature. Computers provide quick and easy access to travel agencies, as well as information on popular tourist areas in any region. They also bring advertising for gyms and ideas on exercising at home. Computers don't hinder workouts and nature walks; they make it easier to do them. But computers make other things easier as well. Schoolwork can be much easier with the use of computers. Instead of dragging around heavy books, students can carry a small laptop; students also can stop worrying about keeping track of papers because everything can be saved to a laptop. Computers organize files so even a messy student can keep organized. Another advantage is that anything typed on a computer is neat and easy to understand, unlike some handwriting. The laptop program in our school district is an example of how schools can be simplified with laptops. Each student is given one to use instead of books. ""It is so much easier,"" said one student. Schoolwork is very difficult for some kids, and computers can make it simpler. My last argument is that people can talk to anyone using chat sites. If someone has a cousin in a distant country, they can still keep in touch. It's the same for friends who moved. E-mail is a lot faster than traditional postal mail. The process of mail carriers taking a letter from one person to another is slow, whereas an e-mail is almost instantaneous. It is also more private; unlike mail that is just sealed with glue, e-mails are password protected. There are also other sites that are for socializing. Instant messages also allow people to talk with one another. This can help people learn about culture in other cities, states, and sometimes even different countries. These sites can help close the gap between cultures; they can help get rid of racism and can help make the world more ideal. Computers make our community better. They let us learn about faraway places, make it easier to enjoy schoolwork, and enable us to talk to other people from almost anywhere. So, don't worry about anything, you'll realize computers truly are beneficial to our society."
1137	1140	1	3	Computers are the future. Computers are the best technology we've created. They allow us to improve our hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway people and places, and connect with our friends. Computers improve our hand-eye coordination; typing is a good way to improve this vital skill by not looking and knowing which buttons are where. Using a mouse is also a good way to improve coordination by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand. This can improve writing, because you are moving the pen in your hand the same way you would move a mouse or type. This can also help with driving, because you can't look at the wheel, you have to keep your eyes on the road, and in order to do that you must know how you're moving the wheel. Computers can help hand-eye coordination which can help with writing and driving, with typing and moving a mouse. Computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places and people. Cultures come in a variety, and we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home. We can also learn about nature from our home. Learning about different cultures can teach us many things, like what kind of clothes they wore, food they ate, and places they lived in. This allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others. Learning about new places can help broaden the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation. Lastly, computers allow us to interact with friends from our chairs. Chatting, e-mailing, and video chatting are all great ways to interact. With a webcam you can even see the other person as if you were face-to-face with them. You can also e-mail important files, such as pictures, documents, and even videos. This can help with someone's job by sharing work quickly. In conclusion, computers can teach us hand-eye coordination, can teach us about faraway places and people, and lets us interact and share with friends. Computers are a very important part of my life and our modern world.
1138	1141	1	3	Dear Editor, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people like me. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk online with other people. I will tell you why we should benefit from these computers. The first reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination. You can learn how to type really fast, which requires your eyes and hands to work together. Without hand-eye coordination, how are you supposed to hit a ball coming at you with a bat, or how are you supposed to catch a ball with your hands? These are skills used in sports that computers can help develop. The second reason is you can learn about far away places and people. Like how we are in the United States and we want to learn about Japan. Or say that we are in France and we want to know about the German people; we can look it up. We don't go all the way down there just to see the German people; we look it up online. Now think about it, you aren't just going to fly there and come back the same day. The last thing is you can talk online to anybody you want from Africa to the US all the way to Australia. You can have conversations and share ideas instantly. So you see computers are really special because you see, you don't want to write someone a million things by hand; it is not right, so we need computers to communicate efficiently in our modern world.
1139	1142	1	3	"Dear Reader, did you know that a large percentage of Americans spend too much time on their computers? I believe people should spend more time outside with their family. This overuse can certainly lead to brain problems, a hard time seeing, and the biggest thing is death. First of all, there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer too much. When they are out with their family, they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a non-stop amount of time, which can affect their mental focus. In a recent survey, it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room, missing out on real social interaction. Most of all, eye doctors have been getting calls from parents. They are worried that their child or children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say: ""I had one child come into my office and he had the hardest time seeing."" He asked the kid's mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, ""My son spends on average three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses are really expensive, adding a financial burden. I have read about children and adults dying from using the computer too much. They have fried their brain from using the computer too much, leading to dangerous behavior. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking into homes, killing people, and hijacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer so much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer too much, the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never for my friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you, so get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you turn your computer off so that you are not tempted to go back on it and can fully enjoy the outdoors."
1140	1143	1	3	To the Editor, I have recently heard that some people think that computers don't benefit society. However, I disagree with that. First, it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. Also, it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends. And lastly, it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can't go outside. Some people might not agree with me; however, I believe the computer wasn't a waste of thought. I think the computer is a benefit to society and the whole world. First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. People, professors, historians, and other highly educated people post discoveries and information about things every day. That means every day someone can learn something new every day of their life. When I do research on an important person in history, I learn things I never learned in school. The computer is the best way to allow people to put info they've learned for other people to see and gain knowledge from each other; these are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can learn on a computer, from science to art. Also, the computer allows family and friends to stay in touch with other family and friends in far away places. If there were no computers and some of your family moved to a different country, there wouldn't be an efficient way to stay in touch with them. The computer allows you to send e-mail to a family's computer or cellular phones. The computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away. My brother is in college and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video chat with him. If there was no computer, I wouldn't be able to chat with my brother and see his face. Lastly, the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day. Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post them online to the public. When I can't go outside because of the weather, I get on my computer and play video games. The games keep me company and engaged. I can even play with other people with online multiplayer, making it a social activity. Some of the games are educational also, teaching you different things about history and problem-solving, which adds to their value.
1141	1144	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike them. On the other hand, I believe that computers put positive effects on people. First of all, they are a great way for kids to have fun: @CAPS1, people can learn very interesting facts. Lastly, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family. These are a few reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with, on a computer you can have a lot of fun by playing games. The computer saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you bought a game system it would cost well over @MONEY1, but on a computer you can find and play games for free. Not all games have to be like ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS5""; they can be games about sports. Suppose one student broke his leg and he loves playing soccer. He could just go on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can @CAPS1 learn various facts right from their computers. The most important thing that computers are made for is to learn new things. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if everyone put what they know into the computer, then people can get learned anything from them. I remember @CAPS6 my friend once told me about some guy named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me. @CAPS6 I got home I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him I knew more than my friend about @PERSON2. If he ever has a question in class and our teacher can't answer it, he/she always tells us to either ""@CAPS7"" it or ""@CAPS8"" it. They both are search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers, you can @CAPS1 communicate with people from different countries. What if @PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be right now? Anyway, most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it is @CAPS9 or @CAPS10, or whether it's @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS11, all are a great way to communicate with people. With telephones it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the computer it is absolutely free. You could be living in @LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @LOCATION5. You could live in @LOCATION2 and email someone in @LOCATION3. Communication everywhere is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in @LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. @CAPS6 we use the computer it is even better because they can even see our face through the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negative at all; for all I know, they help people around the @CAPS2. They help kids have fun with the games we can play. @CAPS1, it teaches children and adults various new things. Lastly, it is a great communication strategy. I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so everyone can see how computers have a positive effect on people."
1142	1145	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers? Computers are one of technology's greatest inventions and are sweeping the nation, as well as the world. As you can probably tell, I believe that computers have positive effects on people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and create the ability to learn and research quickly and efficiently. And don't forget that they offer ways to chat online. Have you ever played a game of baseball where you just can't seem to hit the ball? Well, sounds like you need to work on your hand-eye coordination. Studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people that use computers have an increased hand-eye coordination when doing activities like sports or games. So if you use a computer, you'll be hitting homeruns, not striking out. After you've won your baseball game, it's time for homework, and guess what? Your teacher assigned a project that's due tomorrow! Don't panic, get online! Computers help you learn and research, which is faster than going to the library and getting a book. Say you need the date Olympic gold medalist @PERSON1 was born, google it! Finally, once you have your information all you have to @CAPS2 is cite your source. Ok, now your homework is done and you want to talk to your friend about your plans on @DATE1. Computers offer numerous ways to chat online. There's @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, woVoo, @CAPS7, and many more. So you sign into @CAPS7, and talk with your best friend. Now you're not bored anymore. Computers are a great way to decrease boredom, just by talking with friends online, but you better go to bed soon because you have @ORGANIZATION1's in the morning! As you can see, computers are incorporated into our daily lives. They're everywhere! I believe that they're changing society, mostly for the better. They teach hand-eye coordination, help you research and learn, and let you chat with friends. Additionally, if you don't already have a computer, then get one!
1143	1146	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my point-of-view, I think that computers are positive and can give a lot of information to us humans. Even though some people say computers are sometimes used way too much, computers help the world get in touch with relatives and family from around the world, job findings in different countries and states, and also learning about the whole world. I'm going to explain to you why I think computers are positive for humans. To start off, I would like to say that not everyone's families & friends live close by to each other. They @MONTH1 live across the whole other side of the world. This is why we have webcams and chatting on computers. How could anyone expect us to see our family and friends if there is no webcam? Okay yeah we have cell phones but not everyone can afford them. People can go to their nearest library and use the computer there for free! The next reason why I say that computers are important is because when you get tired of or fired from your job, you can't just sit home and expect to live in your house for free, you have @CAPS1 find another job. You can sign up for jobs right on your computer. How much easier could it get? Now you don't have to borrow your mom's car to go to the interview. Furthermore, the last reason I would like to commit is that learning about the world is very important for the young and old. You don't think that every single teacher visited somewhere else and that's how they know about the world? No, of course not! Teachers also use computers to look up information on a certain subject. For me, I like to learn about crocodiles in @LOCATION1. I live in the @ORGANIZATION2. Do you really think I would go all the way to @LOCATION1 to learn about crocodiles when I can just turn the computer on and get lost in the crocodile world? No, of course not. It would be fun though to travel to @LOCATION1 to see that, but I don't have that kind of money. To sum all this up, I think you can see my part of the argument. I really consider leaving computers to what they do best, helping humans. It's one of the best inventions ever made. Wouldn't you agree?
1144	1147	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us regularly? Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computers allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processors and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now, how do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also websites such as mapquest & yellowpages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students' education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a program on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleagues instantly. What one does is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk about something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist of. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see, computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we go, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are easier for our everyday life. So, don't spend your life on the computer but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine. Stop writing on that pad, get up and type it on your computer!
1145	1148	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you probably have seen there is a lot of controversy over whether computers are helpful or harmful. I for one agree computers are helpful because they help you learn about new things, talk to people around the world, and try new things. For instance, have you ever wondered what the capital of @LOCATION6 is? Well with the computer you could find that answer in the blink of an eye, that's because the internet gives you unparalleled information that no book has. The internet really lets you see what is happening in our world because there are various news sources, and blogs on the internet. @PERSON1, do you remember the earthquake in @LOCATION4? Well I sure do, because I found it out on the internet. You can also find directions to places, sports stats and information about different places. Well what's a better way to find out about those than talking with people who live there? I don't think anything is; seriously, is it better reading about @LOCATION5 or talking to someone in @LOCATION5? That's the beauty of the internet; it bonds the world together into a tighter relationship. I remember chatting with people from @LOCATION3 while the gold medal game @PERSON3. Sure, some people would say that you could meet someone in person from a different country, but how would you meet someone from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1, because I never have. People could say go to the place to talk to the person and, with the internet, it's very possible. Have you @PERSON1 wanted to go to @PERSON4? Well with the internet all you need is your credit card and you could be there tomorrow because the internet allows you to try new things. Have you ever wanted to try ping pong? It's so you could order a set online and have it shipped to you in a couple of days. I always wanted to go to a zoo but I didn't know of any, so I used the internet to search for zoos near @LOCATION1, and before I could move the results for @PERSON2 zoo were right in front of me. That is why the internet is very helpful. To sum it all up, the internet is very helpful to people who use it correctly, but I agree that the internet can be inappropriate. With blocks on the not needed sites, the internet can do almost anything.
1146	1149	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Advances in technology, while amazing, don't always have a positive effect on society. That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't, like a friendly peer. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for, where hurtful messages can be sent anonymously. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and other personal information, which can be hard to remove completely. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them, like playing sports or reading a book. If people spent just as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another through real interaction. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In today's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed to keep up. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising, along with the cost of software and repairs. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the nation. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in today's world."
1147	1150	1	3	Dear The Daily Community Times, Computers are a great piece of technology. Computers are great for many reasons. Three of these reasons are pleasure, convienience, and education. I believe that these three reasons are the main reason we use computers today. One reason we use computers is for pleasure. On certain websites, you can talk to friends, see what your friends are doing, you can even video chat with them. Also, you can watch movies, television episodes, and videos. In addition, you can listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. I strongly beleive that pleasure is one of the main reasons we use computers today. Another reason why we use computers is convienience. Most people in our town have a computer in their home. Computers are convienient because you pay bills on the internet. You email co-workers about jobs and schedule appointments online. In addition, computers can help people create websites so their their buisness is more noticeable to potential customers. As you can see, computers are a very convienient piece of technology. The final reason why we use computers is education. On a computer, you can learn just about anything. You can learn about ancient history, sports, you can learn about current events in the world. Computers can help you study, take notes, and helps do your homework efficiently. When I have a project, I always use the computer to find important information about the topic from reliable sources. As you can see, education is the most important reason why we use computers. Now, I think you understand how computers are important in our town's education, pleasure and convienience. I hope you listened to my opinion on computers and I also hope you continue to tell people how great and important computers are for everyone.
1148	1151	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, It is my belief that people are spending too much time on computers. Now a days you can do anything on a computer. Such as, talk to friends, play games, even turn off your lights! But, what are they taking away from us? There taking away communication skills and is same uses creating cyber bullying. They also don't let us enjoy the beauty of nature and exercising. One out of every three teens spends more time telling people on the computer then face to face. This way of communication prevents children from learning valuable social skills which come with conversing face to face, like reading body language. This makes it more difficult for children to make friends, or even to do well is work intencies. Studies say by each upcoming generation the communication skills are decreasing by a significant amount. Eventually, if this continues to drop at this rate we will have a world that cannot communicate properly. This style of communication has even created a new type of bullying. What have we done to people? You waste over thirty days a year sitting in front of your computer. in this wasted time you could be out going for a jog or walking the dog. in fact, the percentage of people that have computer is much greeter than the percentage of people that do not exercise regularly. The computer cant do that for you. Sitting in front of a computer does nothing for your body. You physicaly have to get up and move. Its good for your health, to get fresh air. Coming to a point about fresh air, a large percentage of people who use computers at home are more likely to become sick than people who get outside. Seeing nature like never before, I dont think you can on a screen. Yes you can look up the green spotted tree frog on the internet, but its nothing like seeing it in nature and in real life. Discoveries cannot be made about new species on the computer, a computer cant find them for you. People are caring less about the environment due to computers. They are seeing a picture not the real thing. After writing this I can tell you that I was thinking about myself and personal habits, which scared me the most I realizes I am becoming more and more dependent on computer each day. I dont see friends as much. I dont go outside as much, and I don't exercise as much. This true for must people whether you realize it or not I personaly am going to try today and cut down on my computer time you will see. Computer are too much lets break from there hold and do something more with there lives. This well improve our health and happiness. So this brings to my final point that computers are a bad influence on human and we should use less of them and live for ourselves by doing not just seeing. Thank you for your time.
1149	1152	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers. I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard, which is a useful skill. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like Abraham Lincoln from the 1800's to Barack Obama who is our presiden now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, Twitter, or Instagram and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew before. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing. They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and nine out of ten people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it. Thank you.
1150	1153	1	3	"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to Hawaii, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about Hawaii. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about Hawaii. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy with work or family. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for three years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time and see his photos. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, offices, teachers, engineers, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, eight out of ten jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional with different fonts. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to Hawaii easier and more enjoyable. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much from the comfort of your own home."
1151	1154	1	3	Dear Readers, I understand that some people think computers can negatively affect peoples' lives. This is because it causes them to not go outside exercising and enjoying nature. My point of view is that people have the choice to go outside, exercise, and enjoy nature. Computers give so much information that it could give people ideas of different activities people can do outdoors, such as hiking trails or local sports events. Computers also have abilities to download videos and other software that people can look at and perform exercising with them, and learn techniques, like yoga or home workouts. In my life my mom and dad, and many other people in my family, look online at different websites to see what activities we can do on the weekends and seasonal activities, which helps us plan our time effectively. Computers are very important and are life changing. If it wasn't for computers some people wouldn't be able to get an education through online courses and resources. Doctors, police officers, and banks use computers for their job and it helps us go through our everyday lives with ease, making services faster and more reliable. From what I see and understand is that computers have a positive effect on our lives. Computers can be negative but it all has to do with self control and how you use it, ensuring a healthy balance with other aspects of life.
1152	1155	1	3	Computers are becoming more advanced everyday, almost everyone owned, or owns a computer. I think they benefit society very greatly. One of the many ways is, they teach you hand eye coordination. So even when you're playing games your hand-eye coordination could be improving. With hand-eye coordination you will need it to play sports like baseball, where timing and precision are crucial. When do you need hand-eye coordination the most? I use it most, when I'm playing hockey or baseball, to react quickly to the puck or hit the ball. So next time you're on a computer, remember your hand-eye coordination is improving. Another reason we benefit from having computers, is we learn about far away places. For instance, you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can't travel to, use a computer to gain some background knowledge. If you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it, what do you do? I know! get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is, if you have to fly out to another country and don't know anything about it, use a laptop on the way over there. If you do that, you'll have some schema about the place, like local customs or key phrases. As you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries. Finally, computers are great for learning a new language. You need to learn spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? Download a free language learning app. If you don't know a lot of french and need a few words but don't have a dictionary, use a translator. When you are talking to someone from another region and you don't know their language use an english to african dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have great translator applications that are free so, if you don't know a language hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, whether it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computer benefit society greatly.
1153	1156	1	3	"To the editor of the daily newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages. Computers these days are being used way too much for useage of priveleges that we already have. While people are using the computer for random activities, they are not having any physical activity. Also emailing and facebooks are great websites to communicate with but people are checking emails all the time instead paying attention to when their parents get home from a long day at work. With this people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side tracked and forget to do homeworks. Computers are great invention but with todays society there are to many issues that aren't always being appointed. In the first place, people aren't getting the exercise that they need because they are playing on the computer or video chatting with a friend. About a third of america is obess so excercising should definitely be a priority but with these new websites and activities on the computer people are getting held back. With this, kids and adults are communicating in high end ways that waste too much time. The computers have so many stupid activities that are not needed which make us not excercise because many people think that the options and webpages are important and needed. Indeed computers are a technology that is needed but people are taking advantage of it too much by having their whole life in the computer instead of having it toward other things such as excercising and being healthy. In addition to computers taking away from excerscising they are also taking time away from your family. For example, last week when my dad got home from a long day at work no one gave him truly a bear hug that he was longing for because everyone was so interested in their email or what my sisters friend just said on facebook. Family is the most important part of your life and if computers are getting in the way, computer use absolutely has to be changed. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still talk to your family and give them hugs but when you are talking to your sister through facebook eventhough there just in the next room. It is obvious something needs to be done. Computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than one. Finally, computers take away family but also schoolwork and works. Most kids spend so much time on the computer and they forget to do their homework. This is unexeptable and can be a problem, kids and teenagers are always playing games, facebooking friends and video chatting making them realize at night that they need to start their home work! A girl from my school said, ""Last time I was on facebook for the whole afternoon and then I realized I never started my history essay!"" This has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain. Moreover, yesterday I remember that I was video chatting my friend for two hours and didn't start my homework until late! The computer affects everyone that uses it which is uneceptable. Without computers there would be less of a negative affect on people. It keeps people from exercising and spending quality time with family, which is unbelievable and terrible. Also they cut communication with your family making it rare to truly bond with them. With this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework. Overall computers are devices that make life that much more stressful. Thank you for listening."
1154	1157	1	3	"In my opinion computers are a good source of information, communication and business; computers make things easier. For example, instead of going to the library to get information on something, you can you use a computer to find it quickly. Computers are one of the most advance technology, you can search anything in the world from the comfort of your home. Computers are also a huge help on a project for school or for work; for some peoples jobs, they are required to use computers daily. Computers are even good for learning about things you've never even heard of, expanding your knowledge easily. Some people even take classes online to further their education. Computers could also be helpful to plan a vacation by comparing flights and hotels. Computers are often used to communicate with others, family, and friends around the world. If you own a computer, you mostly likely have an e-mail, homepage, or social media to keep in touch with people. There are even sites to meet new people with similar interests. In my opinion, I think computers have a positive effect on people; computers can be used for many things, they are a good source of technology. Computers could take much time off your hands, for example, you have a five page essay due tomorrow, I'm sure it'd be way easier and faster to type it out than to write it and mess up. When typing a letter or paper, computers have ""spell check"" so if you mess up on a word, it will show you where you made your mistake to save more time and improve your work."
1155	1158	1	3	Dear newspaper I think that there are many reason why computers are good for people. Compters are good for people because they help keep friends conected. Reason two is that they can be great knowledge sources for people. A third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with teamworks and team building skills. Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect. First of all, I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a colledge far away, or move because of a job you will most likely, if the distance is further away, loose connection with you friends. But, using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like Facebook, twitter and myspace you can simpily look up your distant friends from where you previoulsy lived and have contact with them. You can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, and maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. A significant percentage of friendships have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer. Experts also say that it is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a scoial networking site has reconnected me with a childhood friend. When i was younger I had a friend whos grandmother lived next to my dad. After a little over a year of him being good friends he moves to another state, I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year I also moved to a different town, but my friend searched me on Facebook and we got connected again, I have found out he moved back to where I use to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are very good for people. The second reason, which is that computers can be great knowledge scources for people. If you ever need to get information quickly you do not have to search through the pages of a book, then, a computer is the thing for you. As long as you know how to find an accurate and reliable scourse than a computer is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find lots of information on it. Statistics show that you can find significantly more information on a computer than a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolite and computer will remain as knowledge scources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills. What I mean by programs is yes of course videogames. Almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features. Withins the multiplayer universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. In the strategy games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is the third reason why I think computers are good for people. In conclusion, I think that computers are good for people, they help to reconnect friends, provide knowledge, and build teambuilding skills with programs that are out for everyone.
1156	1159	1	3	"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more than @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful nature is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke,"" says Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people won't even turn off the computer for @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they prevent people from seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are not spending it with their families. I used to think that talking with someone online was fine. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl who would always talk through email, texting, or instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems related to poor communication. All smart, intelligent people talk about families, and these successful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @NUM5 out of @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit to not getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion, computers take away some important things like exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative effect? Our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of it, families are seeing their bonds break up, and health is suffering a lot because of computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make to stand against them."
1157	1160	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons I believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things, you can also find a relative you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends, another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's and other devices. My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us a lot of things. If you wanted to know about a country's culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things and on the computer you can look it up and find out. Another reason is you can find a family member you haven't seen in a long time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer. Also a lot of people @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again; they can find them and feel close to them again. And they can find you if they really need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friend relieves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breathe. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and a lot of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers there's no point of having these music devices. In conclusion I think computers have a good effect on people because they help us learn, connect, and enjoy life.
1158	1161	1	3	To @CAPS1 in @MONTH1 concern, today people of all ages are using computers. Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you may have needed to know. Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper. Teachers have trouble reading other handwriting so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful. The nearby library will always have extra computers students can use to write a paper. If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you may find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives. Some of these relatives may live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that homework. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information. Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there. By going on one of the search engines they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo. In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 & how it is in a @CAPS9. Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope you will look into what I said about the benefits of computers for students and families.
1159	1162	1	3	"Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes technology, especially computers can bring people together and computers are very beneficial to students. Also computers can save you time and money now. First off computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! and I don't get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop. and if I didn't have that opportunity then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together. It is a wonderful experience. As I said before computers can be beneficial to students. You might be thinking ""@CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes. com, if that wasn't available I would have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very beneficial! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered offline. You can get things from food to cloths and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, students with homework, family and friends and adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that computers are a positive force in our lives."
1160	1163	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. My best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. He told me, ""If the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" He relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. How would you feel if you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? My guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that it enhances it. My sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and my sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, if it wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs exercise? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but how will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" My friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""How did you find out about it?"" I asked. ""It was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and it came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and exercise equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. If reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?"
1161	1164	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am aware of the current debate about technology, however more specifically computers. Computers are a helpful, interesting, and even fun piece of technology that have become integral to modern life. Computers open the world to new people & places, and limiting that is uncalled for. They are keys to innovation and creation, driving progress in countless fields. When @ORGANIZATION1 did a study on the use of computers, @PERCENT1 of people said they got their news, files, and even planned through the computer, and now @PERCENT2 of creations are being done through the computer. This illustrates the power of computers, allowing people to do things that were once impossible, such as designing complex structures or composing digital art. Now humans are capable of spreading info around the world in seconds, connecting continents instantly. Computers also help business grow through advertisement or work software, enabling small companies to reach global markets. Computers are the key to help open the world to new possibilities and options not possible @NUM1 years ago, like remote work and online education. I understand my opposition is not only against computers but wants to limit their use. That is unfair and possibly unconstitutional, as it restricts access to information. They argue that people exercise less due to computers; however, @PERCENT3 of people, when asked if computers negatively impacted your exercise, said ""no,"" and one man stated, ""because of computers I learned new workouts and even found a great local trainer."" @CAPS2, you can understand computers are not just about games and toys, but allowing people to grow and learn more to help them find places to travel and assist in their exercise routines. Computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication. Emails, @CAPS3, and other software allow people to communicate across the world seamlessly. @CAPS2, as the world begins to innovate itself, communication is key. People are capable of spreading news in seconds; in fact, @PERCENT4 of news is now done through the computer. New @CAPS4 Times and the Wall Street @CAPS5 have moved their news mainly to the internet, allowing people across the globe to see them. Work is also primarily done through the computer now. People are able to send files, ship, and even order online with ease. Even important business meetings are done through the computer, where all the people can be at their house, saving time and resources. Computers are a necessity when it comes to communications, work, and news. I hope you understand and put to use my opinion. Computers are needed to grow, @CAPS2; a world solving problems, communicating, and expanding is why I believe there are no problems with computers, only opportunities for a brighter future."
1162	1165	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you that I think computers are a smart investment for a couple of reasons. The following are some reasons on why computers benefit society: they allow children to do homework with some help, children can talk to other friends, and when children are bored they can play games or listen to music on it. UGH! I don't get this sometimes; I am sitting at the kitchen table trying to do my history homework but I don't know the year the Revolutionary War was. @CAPS2, I go in my room, turn the computer on, and @CAPS6, there I go to Google and look up what I need to know quickly. This also benefits parents too because if they are doing the bills or something, they don't have to be bothered; the kid could look it up and know it is @CAPS6! Finally, all my homework is done but my computer is still on; I'm going to see who is online that I can talk to and make sure I didn't miss any homework assignments. Talking to your friends online could help you stay in contact with friends in other states or just people you don't see very often, strengthening those bonds. This can help make new friends or make friendships closer and cause less problems by keeping everyone connected. Alright, nobody is home or online, @CAPS2, I think @CAPS3, I'm going to kick back, turn some music on to relax, and maybe take a nap. Or I can play the new Counter Strike game I got! YEAH, on playing Counter Strike. Least deaths on my team that game! Alright, that's enough of Counter Strike for the day; I think I'm going to turn some music on and lay in bed. Now that I have told you all of the benefits of computers, You @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, keep in mind that it can help with homework, talking with friends, or just having some fun, making it a valuable tool for everyone.
1163	1166	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while, but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall, as they often lead to more harm than good. When people are on the computer, they spend multiple hours on it, which becomes a significant drain on time and energy. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming their bodies through prolonged inactivity. Not only this, but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessively, checking for updates constantly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family, leading to strained relationships. Everyone knows exercise is important; however, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1, and it is a serious concern. Heart disease is often caused by obesity, which results from a sedentary lifestyle. That's what happens when you don't exercise regularly. When you are on the computer, you are sitting down rather than moving around, which reduces your activity levels. This means that your metabolism isn't going and you burn fewer calories, contributing to weight gain. That is not healthy for anyone, even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer, you have to look at the screen, which emits very bright @CAPS3 lights that can strain your eyes. After looking at the screen for so long, your eyes will begin to feel the effects of the lights, causing discomfort and fatigue. Many people say it's like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time, leading to headaches. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for too long, which is a significant number. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before, showing a clear increase. We used to have about @NUM3, but now it's much higher. Like I said before, when you use the computer, you use it for an extended amount of time, which takes away from other activities. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right and can lead to loneliness. In a survey, an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that they spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and only about an hour with family, which is concerning. The results were more than shocking; with all of this in mind, ask yourself how useful the computer really is. Sure, it's good at researching things quickly, but it's also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glasses, and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all and may do more damage than good in our daily lives.
1164	1167	1	3	How do you think the world would be without computers? I think it would bring us back a couple of ages, slowing down progress significantly. We need computers for communication and to learn things that we need to learn, as they are essential tools in education. Without computers, our country would be nothing compared to others who embrace technology. People say you don't get enough exercise and don't enjoy nature enough, but well, there are ways to do that too while using computers. Communication is one of the greatest things about computers, enabling instant connections. Teenagers love to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 each other when they're at home because it's so fast it's like really talking to them, making distances feel smaller. @CAPS1-@CAPS2 is another thing people love to use for quick messages. Bosses of companies use @CAPS1-@CAPS2 to send @CAPS10 to everyone so they're all on the same page, ensuring efficient teamwork. There is also a new video chat where you can talk face to face with someone and see them from the other side of the world if you wanted to, bridging gaps. You can also learn all you need to know on computers, accessing vast resources. They have dictionary sites, history sites, encyclopedia sites, etc., providing information at your fingertips. You can find any certain time in history and have a whole site on it, detailing events. Or a site called Wikipedia where you can look up a certain thing and get a whole web page dedicated to the info of that object or person. Schools also use sites to help students have their knowledge, enhancing learning. They have math sites, English sites, @CAPS3 studies sites, and (a science teacher favorite) @CAPS4 @CAPS5 for everything you need to know about science, making subjects more engaging. They also have lots of websites for help with a new language, aiding in fluency. There is a recent program out called @CAPS6 @CAPS7 that is on the computer but teaches you any language as well as any human teacher, offering personalized lessons. Some people still say it's not enough, arguing for balance. They say you still need exercise, nature, and time with your family, which are important. You can still do all that with computers by using them wisely. You can look up certain workouts that you might want to do, finding routines online. You can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live, discovering nature spots. They have websites (like @CAPS8) where you can @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @CAPS11 pictures, play games, and video chat with your family members who @MONTH1 be living across the world from you, keeping connections strong. But you can still do it, integrating technology into a healthy lifestyle. Even though I explained a lot of reasons why computers are a great thing to have, there are still a ton more, like their versatility. They teach hand-eye coordination and many other things too, through interactive applications. You can check sports scores from the night before or check sports scores from @NUM1 years ago, satisfying curiosities. You can do all this on the computer and more, making it an indispensable tool. This is why computers have a positive effect on people and everyone should have a computer to enhance their lives and opportunities.
1165	1168	1	3	"Dear newspaper writer, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because @CAPS1 helps people around the world learn to speak a different language, @CAPS1 helps people talk to their friends around the world, and @CAPS1 helps people by making it easier to write a letter and send it out to people they work for or to their bosses that need the report in by the end of the day. Those are the three reasons that computers have a positive effect, enhancing daily tasks. @CAPS1 helps people learn to speak a different language without spending a lot of money; like using Rosetta Stone, you have to spend @NUM1 US dollars, but online you don't have to spend a dime, making education accessible. The best part is that @CAPS1 is free, removing financial barriers. The slogan for Rosetta Stone is ""I have spent less money than months of formal classes,"" highlighting affordability. I think their new slogan should be ""we have a better learning company than anyone else,"" emphasizing quality. That is why @CAPS1 helps people learn a different language effectively and efficiently. @CAPS1 also helps people by making it easier to talk to their friends; you can AIM, webcast, and even text to make it easier to talk to friends on the internet, fostering communication. The reason they created that is so people don't have to travel to far away places and spend money to tell a friend important news; that is only one thing, but it saves time and resources. So in conclusion, you don't have to spend a lot of money to tell a friend something, making connections affordable. The third reason that the computer helps people is that people can email their boss that they are faxing their final report to the big interview for a new position in the place where they work, streamlining processes. @CAPS1 helps your boss by making it easier to read and better because you could be in Japan and your boss could be in Florida; @CAPS1 will take like @NUM2 minutes to get to your boss's computer, ensuring quick delivery. That is why @CAPS1 is easier to send messages to your boss, improving workplace efficiency. The three main reasons are that you can learn a different language without paying a dime, that you can talk to your friends easier, and that you can send messages to your boss easier than calling him or her. Those are the three reasons that computers are positive, demonstrating their invaluable role in modern communication and learning."
1166	1169	1	3	To the Middlebury paper, regarding the article on whether or not computers benefit society, my opinion is that they have lots of significant pros to make them a worthwhile thing to have in our towns, schools, homes, and businesses. They can help more than they hurt, and can you honestly see your life without checking e-mails and keeping up to date with our society? Computers in schools help to increase the amount of learning our children receive. For example, a student can study their math facts online for math class or learn about the skeletal system for health classes. It also is an advantage in conserving money because instead of having to pay for your son or daughter to fly to Rome to learn about the Colosseum, you can let them learn about it on the internet first, to see if the trip is actually worthwhile. Also an essential thing needed for life is hand-eye coordination, and a way to practice that is by playing exercise practice games on a computer. That helps instill the coordination your towns children will use for the rest of their lives! Educational benefits will only increase as technology improves, so cutting children from it now is a big mistake! With computers, communication is a breeze. Students can get homework assignments through their e-mail, saving time so they have more time for studying coming up. The cost effectiveness of computers is clear because instead of paying for phone bills and tutors for your children and cellphone bills, you can just talk through e-mail and potentially save money! Keeping in touch with families is simplified also because in just one e-mail you can catch up with all your family members! Speeding up communication with computers clearly has benefits no one wants to miss out on. So why would you make that mistake? In addressing concerns, you can't place the blame on computers for why people don't exercise as much. People choose how much they exercise, not the computers. Computers don't control whether you see family or not. If anything they help bring people together! Spending time in nature is that particular person's choice, no one else's. All these cons can't be blamed on computers, because its the people that decide how much they're used, not the computer. All in all, I think keeping our use of computers where it is now is the best idea, because without it communication and education will decrease and with that, who says exercising will increase?! Overall the choice is the computer's user, not the computer, so when used in discretion, computers contribute greatly to society.
1167	1170	1	3	"Dear Editor, it has come to my attention that certain members of our society believe that computers are not beneficial. This position comes from a lack of judgement and a closed mind. Computers are lifelines to business workers who use them to complete all of their work; these tools also enable news of disaster or weather to spread efficiently and effectively. These technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends. In today's society computers are vital and getting rid of them would be like stopping oxygen from making its way to the body, being accompanied by multiple severe consequences. First and foremost, a large percentage of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers. These works of art aren't just handy-dandy toys, rather they are essential to the working class like a pencil is to a student taking a test. John, an owner of a small business, agrees. ""My company designs software and uses computers daily. Many of my employees work from home and have to own computers."" The growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon, rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others. By ripping our computers from the lives of workers chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences. Adults aren't the only ones whose jobs consist of computers. Nowadays students' homework is mostly online; computers decrease the amount of time needed to write an essay and are a boon to students of all ages. Sarah, an eighth grader at the local middle school, is an example of this. Every night she has at least three hours of homework and usually one hour of it requires a computer; however, this isn't a problem because it cuts back the time it takes for Sarah to do her homework. She can quickly type up an English essay or research a science topic instead of doing it painstakingly slow using an old fashioned method. Moreover, computers are doors into the real world, especially for residents of our town. Whether some people like to believe it or not, our town is a bit of a secluded area where people aren't always aware of what is going on outside of their closed off town. Computers cause news to spread like electricity and open our residents' eyes to national and global problems. Tom, another student at the high school, states, ""When the earthquake took place in Japan my friends and I were all at lunch, and when we came back to class our teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the white board."" If computers were taken away a stream of knowledge would be cut off from adults and children. Most importantly, computers create communication between friends and family; calling up to talk to someone isn't always an option, so computers are the better choice. Families can connect with each other no matter if they have cell phone reception or what area of the world they are in. Emily is a senior at our local high school who agrees. ""When I go to college next year I am going all the way to California and want to be able to talk to my family; via email and instant message I can contact them even when its inconvenient because they don't have to respond right away."" Emily brings up a good point; computers serve the luxury of communication, which is vital to keep a majority of healthy relationships, as shows a study at the university. In conclusion, computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away. They are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world. Computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate. Therefore, I urge you, readers of the newspaper, to raise your voice about the benefits of computers, so they aren't taken away from our society."
1168	1171	1	3	"""Hello? Are you there?"" ""Can you hear me?"" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necessity to an average person. Computers help everyone, and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but do they always prove trustworthy? Computers are always reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others that are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you can choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personally preferred option is email. I myself have family in Europe, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be through the roof! How else am I supposed to keep in touch with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, three out of four families in our state say they have relatives that are far away. That is a large percentage of the population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would be rolling in money and regular families would be living on the streets. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their family. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you can interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far away colleges or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could visit a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this: where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are killed for them. Computers are the easy, environment friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that may be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible dangers. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. ""Dangers are only powerful if you let them be, and let them take control,"" says Dr. Evans, an expert on the subject. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today, and tomorrow, know what is out there, and how to stop the minor risks. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn new things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. What are safe even if some don't agree? It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes, computers! I see why you might think no, they should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and t.v. will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers, and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to!"
1169	1172	1	3	More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society, are right. I feel this way because people need to start exercising more, and interact with family and friends in person. Also, they should get out and enjoy life. Please read on to read in detail, as to why I feel this way. Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more; they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. Also, some of them don't even exercise at all, choosing to remain sedentary for hours. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much in a meaningful way. Those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of the computer. When you fight with people you want to get away from it so you go back to the computer. It's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time, as it can strain relationships. Lastly, they should enjoy life. See the world through their own eyes, not through a screen. Party with friends and family in person. Go to college and do something with their lives that is active and engaging. They need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers, iPods, or even cellphones, experiencing the world directly. In conclusion, the reasons I feel this way are because people need to exercise more, and interact with family and friends directly. Also, they need to enjoy life beyond the digital realm. I hope you understand as to why I feel this way and consider the importance of a balanced life.
1170	1173	1	3	Dear Editor, I believe that computers are beneficial to society. This is because computers do tasks such as help with research, communicating with others, and have fun games and websites. Computers are really great sources for whatever you are trying to do. Honestly, a world without computers I wouldn't know what to do. Computers are like digital encyclopedias, which have just about all the information you're looking for. Computers have databases or websites designed to help with research just as they do. Say that you have an essay due tomorrow and you need quick and valid information; you can simply go to an online library database which is a computer database. You end up with solid facts to help with your final draft. So, you wouldn't have to go that far to research. Communicating is something else the computer helps with. For example, email and instant messaging are ways to communicate. Email is where you can send a message and await a reply while on the other hand instant messaging is where you get immediate replies. The latest thing in the communicating world is video chatting. This is where the person you're chatting with can hear and see exactly what you're doing. This is useful for families who live a good distance from each other. Computers play many roles and being used for fun is one. The internet has many fun gaming websites such as Miniclip.com and others. These websites help take your mind off a bad day. You can also buy computer games for your computer. A very popular game is The Sims. This game is based around your character and the life you choose for it to live; this game can take you to another place where all your stress just fades away. So, computers better society in many different ways. A few key areas include research, communication, and having fun. The computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich one's life. Computers take on difficult tasks and usually succeed. So, computers are truly one thing we need to continue advancing and utilizing for a better future.
1171	1174	1	3	"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, did you know that a long time spent on technology could result in serious health issues like cancer? Ever since they were invented, computers have been advanced more and more even over the years. People, especially children, often forget the serious risks to their physical health, their family and friends, and even their mental health. The obesity rate is over to @LOCATION1, the highest it has ever been, and many people wouldn't even know that technology is to blame. @CAPS2, did you know the average @CAPS3 teenager spends at least @NUM1 hours on the computers? Think of all the calories that build up without any exercise. If people could limit their screen time, they would be less at risk for diabetes. Diabetis is one of the most common diseases involved with technology besides obesity. With @NUM2 @CAPS4 being diabetic, it means we are not at a safe health rate. If you limit computer use to just @NUM3 hour a day, and work out at least @NUM4 minutes a day, think of how healthy you will be. You will have more energy, and better mental focus, sleep won't be an issue, and you will be more physically attractive. Computers can also lead to friendships being torn apart, and cyber bullying is also a major problem. About @NUM4 of students are cyber bullies. This means that friends will not see each other if they spend all day on the computer, which harms mental health when they turn it on. @CAPS2, did you know some forms of cancer are caused by the radiation from technological devices? Radiation can eat away at the brain, causing altsimers and other mental diseases that usually appear at an old age. Young adults in school have also got used to texting. About @PERCENT1 of students text, and @PERCENT2 get used to terrible spelling, that's @PERCENT3 who accidentally write words like ""thru, lazy, or even native @CAPS5 during school."" This is the mental effect of technology taking over. So as you can tell, computers affect physical health, socializing, and even mentality. So don't be part of the problem, please, stop the overuse of technology for a better life."
1172	1175	1	3	"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time, and every day more people buy computers and every day people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people far away, they have had a significant negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it immensely. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get seriously addicted. People become addicted to computers because of the engaging games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. This addiction to computers leads to serious issues. People have even died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping properly. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1 was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as a smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email, and people are frequently bullied there. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling deeply. Online bullying is often worse that interacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop this behavior. Also, people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise. @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to the number of overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing a letter, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this convenience is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. People spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature outside. In conclusion, computers have a clear negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise in our society. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Remember, addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight are not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more to consider for our well-being."
1173	1176	1	3	Dear newspaper, I hear that more and more people use computers and I think that is so awesome because people talk online with other people. @CAPS5 they teach you how to use a computer properly. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and different people. Computers are the more advanced technology so its @CAPS1 that people are using it. I love to be on the computer all day because I always enter to @CAPS2 and talk online with others. @CAPS4 example, some people like to talk with a family member that is not in the @LOCATION1 so they communicate from the computer. Sometimes I talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2 because I have @NUM1 years I dont see her. So I think talking online or using the computer is very important. @CAPS4 example, even grandma have @CAPS3 and she talks online with her family members regularly. I think that using the computer is not a bad benefit because it helps you be in constant communication with your family or friends. That is why I think the people who say it is bad are wrong. Secondly, it teaches you hand-eye coordination. My grandma is old but the computer and @CAPS4 example my grandma has a nice hand eye coordination because when she goes to the letters she just presses and all she writes is correct. I think computers have a positive effect on people. It @CAPS5 helps people write better and better over time. @CAPS4 example, I love that when I write I dont need to go to other sources; I write kind of @CAPS5 that helps me with my eye and hand coordination. @CAPS6 is that it helps you find faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example, on @ORGANIZATION1 you can find what ever street you want. It @CAPS5 can help you find in the computer information about people. @CAPS4 example, if I have a school project I find the information on @ORGANIZATION1 about people or places. The computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people easily. I think it has a positive effect on people. Finally, I think that computers are great benefits to society. One reason is that you could talk online with people from anywhere. @CAPS5 it teaches you hand-eye coordination and that helps your brain and sight. It @CAPS5 helps you with your hand movements and dexterity. @CAPS6 reason is that it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example, I had a project in @CAPS7 and I had to learn and search about forensic doctor and I found everything on the computer. I think that computers help your brain think more and computers are advanced technology that benefits everyone. So I think their benefits for our society are very clear and important.
1174	1177	1	3	"I agree that computers have a bad effect on people because they will spend less time exercising. Too much time on the computer takes away valuable knowledge and takes away precious time with family and friends. So, please listen up so I @MONTH1 can explain why I feel this way. My first reason to this situation is people will spend less time exercising which can lead to drowsiness or laziness if you stop exercising regularly. Another reason is that it can affect your ability to run or even stand up properly because @PERSON1 says that, ""people who exercise a lot will be able to do work but if you don't you won't be able to do nothing."" @CAPS1 of all you'll miss out on the fun activities while you are to be to lazy to come and participate. My second reason to this situation is that it takes away knowledge from your mind. For one you might forget what you learned in school. Seconds, tutoring @MONTH1 be needed because you couldn't focus on your studies. @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 even forget the people you know, even where you live if you spend to much time on the computer and not engaging with the real world. @CAPS1 reason to this situation is that it takes time away from your family and friends, weakening those important relationships. Therefore, it is clear that excessive computer use is harmful to our health, our minds, and our social connections."
1175	1178	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student I believe that computers have many bad effects on people. Most people think that computers are just new helpful technology, but there is more to it than just that. There are many dangerous things going on in the cyber world. Computers are quite helpful in school research, work and other important stuff, but there are many bad effects too that we must consider. Kids these days are so attached to their computers almost all day after getting home from school which means that they barely do homework, projects, and important assignments from getting too distracted by the computer. There are some parents who get tricked by their kids that they are just doing homework, but reality is that kids these times are meeting tons of strangers through social networks such @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 @NUM1, @CAPS6 and other networks. Once that they decide to meet in person with these strangers many things go wrong because not everyone is @CAPS2 nice @CAPS2 they @MONTH1 seem through the internet. It shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much without supervision. Furthermore, people such @CAPS2 young children, pre teens and teenagers are able to view many harmful and inappropriate things anyone their ages shouldn't be viewing at all. Another concern is how people spend all day on their computers probably eating any type of junk food and then they don't exercise at all and they gain weight and not well fit physically which becomes a health issue for kids @CAPS2 age @NUM2 to much older people such @CAPS2 age @NUM3 and much older too which turns out to be a bad health life for people. From people spending nearly all day on the computer, they aren't able to go out and discover new things, exercise, hang out with friends or just have fun and spend time with their families. I also do strongly consider that the computers or laptops should not stay in a kids room because then they lock themselves in their room all day and they even stay up till really late even past midnight and then it becomes a real issue for kids or adults to get up early in the @TIME1 for school or work and are usually late. This pretty much shows how computers are not so great for people all the time. In order for people to be able to use their computers and have a balanced life they can plan out a schedule of how long to use the computer and it might help them out a lot in managing their time and health better.
1176	1179	1	3	I believe that people spending too much time on computers can negatively affect their health and the relationships they have with friends and family. If you are immersed in the computer and one of your friends asks you to go outside, you are most likely to say no because the computer is grabbing your attention more than the prospect of going outside. That refusal hurts your health by keeping you sedentary and damages your relationship with your friend. Similarly, if your family is going to a movie to have family time, you might choose to stay home on the computer instead. That decision directly affects the bond you share with your family. Most people would rather stay on the computer than spend time working out. This pattern effects your health because often when you are on the computer for a long time you end up feeling hungry and keep eating and eating; since you are not working out, you can easily gain weight. You are not exercising and you just keep consuming snacks. Since you are not being physically active and your mind is always focused on the computer, your body can become weak and you can get sick. That is a primary reason why many people are not healthy today. Computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes your friend can ask you to go outside or to work out and you say no because you are preoccupied with the computer, which strains your friendship. Or your family could be having a movie night and you remain on the computer while they leave without you. That is actively messing up the relationship with your family. Furthermore, being on the computer can lead you to go nights without sleeping. If you are playing a really engaging game and it comes time for you to take a rest, the game's fun can compel you to forgo sleep. After a while, this can become an addiction and you won't stop playing. Consequently, you won't get adequate sleep and if you have school the next day, you won't be able to concentrate, being too busy worrying about the game. So that is why computers aren't so good for us. They can mess up your physical health, they can damage your social life with family and friends, and they can cause sleep deprivation that hinders your ability to focus.
1177	1180	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, ""Get off that computer, it is time for dinner!"" But mom, I don't want to, I'm in the middle of a game. Does that conversation sound familiar? Of course it does, as every kid likes to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer for excessive hours is not a good thing. In this matter, experts are definitely right because kids and adults are spending too much time on the computer. These people could be doing other beneficial things like exercising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is simply not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you off the computer, you can always use that time to get that six-pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can transform your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to being firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm-up. Every year my dad takes me to the track in the summer and times me for the forty and one-hundred yard dash, the four-hundred meter, and the mile run. Between the months I train all the way up to the final assessment, then my dad does another evaluation. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another excellent way to get in shape. Some basic exercises are bench pressing, squatting, and dumbbell curls. There are more challenging exercises, but I won't go into that here. Once you feel like you are in shape, take all of that training and put it into playing a sport. Exercising is not the only thing you can do; enjoying nature is another wonderful option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absorb everything about the nature around you, from the squirrels to the trees. If you are in the winter, enjoy the snow instead of being inside all day playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you, then hang out with your family. Hanging out with your family can be a rewarding thing to do. Gather your family and plan a trip together. You can go to a baseball game, a park, or the movies—anything that will get you away from that computer screen. That is my opinion on why I think people should get exercise, enjoy nature, and spend quality time with their families instead of being on the computer constantly."
1178	1181	1	3	One girl sits by her computer doing homework. Another girl with her computer talks to her friends. Those girls are doing activities that make our world more productive. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help people with hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk with others online. This is what computers can do to help our society become better. Firstly, the computer can teach us valuable hand-eye coordination. By playing various games, we can use the skills we learn in real life. A boy can play football online, then take what he learned about timing and reflexes and use that in a real football game. Hand-eye coordination developed on the computer can help us to learn new things about our society and our own capabilities. We could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to improve the community as a whole. These skills can also help us do more things at once. Multitasking is a difficult task to master, and with good hand-eye coordination and computer practice, it becomes easier. A second productive task computers can help us with is learning about the world. Some people don't know what is going on in other countries; the computer can direct us to news and information instantly. The computer is literally like one huge library for us to use. Another positive effect that computers have on people is communication. Many people have a Twitter, Facebook, Myspace, etc., and all those websites can help them stay connected. Products like Skype, video chat, AIM, and email allow people to have conversations online. Email is something that facilitates so many new ideas. You cannot only talk, you can do business, send pictures, invitations, and announcements. Schools, offices, and companies all over the world use these products and it doesn't only make society better, it makes the entire world better. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people around the world. They can help with hand-eye coordination, help you learn about far away places, and they help people communicate effectively. That one girl doing her homework gets an A and the girl talking on her computer signs off to be with her family.
1179	1182	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, I believe computers and excelling technology benefit society because they can help with hand-eye coordination, they provide an easy way to learn about faraway places and cultures, and they allow you to save and use your time more wisely. First of all, every person needs hand-eye coordination; if you didn't have it, you would either throw a ball in the complete other direction or you would get hit in the face with it. Computers benefit children's education too, as they can help you discover and learn about far away places from the comfort of your home. For example, if a student is studying a famous explorer in their history class, a renowned author in English class, or maybe a composer in music class, instead of pulling out the old, dusty biography book, it would be easier and faster to look them up on a search engine. Lastly, the computer benefits everyday working people or stay-at-home parents because if you have to get in contact with a certain person or business quickly, you don't have to take the chance of looking in a phone book and finding the listing is not there. You can just go to a search website, type in a last name or business name, and you are all set. Also, if your child is being a nuisance screaming and running around the house, you can just set them up with an educational game so you can get your household chores finished without interruption. Those are three of the most important reasons why I think computers benefit society. They are hand-eye coordination, innovative learning techniques, and saving everyday people valuable time.
1180	1183	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, I think computers have a bad effect on people for three main reasons. One, they can really hurt your eyes. Two, they can pose safety risks if you have little kids in your house. Finally, three, you will never see your family or friends if you are always on the computer. The first reason computers have a bad effect on people is that they can really hurt your eyes. If you are always staring at a computer screen all the time, you can strain your vision and potentially cause long-term damage. With you having bad eyesight, you can even be more prone to accidents and serious head injuries just from the disorientation caused by hurting your eyes. The second reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that they are not safe if you have little kids in your home. For instance, you could be watching an adult movie that little kids are not old enough to see, and this exposure can have a bad effect on them. It has a bad effect on people because you will have no control over what they see, and if you have a little kid in your house he will always be curious and he will probably hear something really, really inappropriate, like adult music or language, if you are not careful about what you access with a kid in the house. The third reason was that computers have bad effects on people is that if you are always on a computer, you will never see your family and friends. If you are always on the computers you will miss out on the important moments and shared experiences. You will never engage with your loved ones and don't pay the rent of attention they deserve because you are focused on the computers. You forget what your family looks like and you fail to keep the little kid with you engaged in the house. And last, the solution is simple: get off the computer and go see your family and friends in person.
1181	1184	1	3	"In today's day and age, computers are a key part of business, education, and recreation and they benefit our society. First of all, you can get a better education learning from them, also, it is a great way to communicate with people. Finally, it even teaches hand-eye coordination that you could use in your everyday life. My first point is that you can get a better education using them. For example, the textbooks that we use in social studies at our school still refers to the Soviet Union as the USSR. Computers are a great way to get up-to-date information about the world. ""With our outdated textbooks in school, the Internet is our number one recourse to get information,"" said Mr. Jones, an eighth grade teacher. With computers, you can learn about far away places without leaving the comfort of your own home. In addition to getting a great education from them, computers are an excellent form of communication. I remember when I was in fifth grade and my father was across the world on a business trip. Our phones couldn't call long distance so we relied on computers to communicate with each other. This helped me get over my father's absence. When you use a computer to communicate you are also saving money. ""You can save over five hundred dollars a year when you use the Internet to communicate over a cell phone,"" stated Jane Smith, an electronics expert. Finally, the use of a computer increases hand-eye coordination. With all the typing you do on a keyboard, your hand dexterity increases by the second. In fact, ""seventy-five percent of computer users are more coordinated throughout their day, opposed to people who don't own a computer,"" according to a recent poll in the New York Times. And in this day and age hand-eye coordination is a necessity. Besides, wouldn't you like to have the ability to have your hands work without having to look at them? So as you can see, computers would benefit society and everyone who uses them. They are a great benefit that students need for their education and business. Thank you for listening."
1182	1185	1	3	"Dear Editor, People like computers, it is a known fact. They are very much like a drug, addicting and irresistible. Despite what people believe though computers are very good for our daily lives. You can communicate, play games, listen to music, watch movies, even learn a language on the computers. So in all ways, the computer is anything but bad. Video games are fun. They help us relax. In today's age, traditional games just don't give people the joy they experienced when younger. Computer games, they are the replacement. Imagine playing baseball with a friend who lives miles away from you, while still being a kid in your own living room, or set in your exercise adventure. Computer games broke the border giving you a higher level of interaction. ""You got mail."" Many people hear that sentence more than once everyday. By many, I mean millions. It is an alert saying that someone sent you an email. Emails are messages sent over the Internet, faster than any postal service. Instead of waiting three days for a letter, in a matter of minutes you can have a message sent to your friends. Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, and other electronic messaging systems are a superior form of communication; these let us speak to the world! Although it sounds silly, if you wanted to, you could send a message to anyone with a message box. Let's say you went to watch a certain movie, but you don't own it. With a computer with a DVD drive, you can watch any film. Better yet, you can download the movies; media are available online, with you able to watch them with the click of the mouse. Computers are filled to the top with gadgets and accessories that make our life easier. Games, movies, emails—anything you need is likely on a computer. They are the perfect tools in modern society."
1183	1186	1	3	"Dear Editor: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. I, for one, believe computers help society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people information, and even allow people to chat online with others. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer; you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I like it. Another thing I like are sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball you need to have hand-eye coordination; this will help you swing at the ball more accurately. When a pitcher throws the ball you have to hold the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing. If kids used computers and became good at hand-eye coordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join a travel team. Do you like to travel? I do, and the way I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago I went on vacation to Florida. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before, so when I looked it up I found out that they had many tourist attractions and ""packages"" that let you swim with dolphins. I was very excited to go and when I did, I had a blast, and to think if I didn't look it up I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! No wonder so many people like computers! One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online; one main attraction online is Facebook. Everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. One night I was chatting with a friend; we were laughing having a great time, and then she reminded me that we had science homework due the very next day! I thanked her and then completed my work. You see if kids chat online their friends can remind them of important necessities such as homework. This could improve grades by fifteen percent! So you now see why society needs computers and if you have forgotten let me remind you: computers teach you hand-eye coordination, let you learn about faraway places and people, and now allow you to chat online. Just think what would society be like with no computers."
1184	1187	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever used a computer? More than ninety percent of the population has. Computers benefit society and have gotten people all over the world smarter and more advanced. Computers help people learn things and keep in touch with family and friends! They may also be a tad addicting but people know when to stop. Computers have brought us a long way! Computers are a magnificent tool for learning new things. The great websites, for example search engines, dictionaries, and even Wikipedia, all virtually encourage us to learn about the ""riches"" of the tropical rainforest. By computers letting people easily access tools that help us gain knowledge, we can become more advanced in many aspects of our lives. For example, by using the computer, scientists can develop new theories and uncover new things! Computers also have websites and programs that can help you connect with family and friends! ""I have lost touch with many of my friends from high school,"" John Doe explains, ""but the computer, through email and Facebook, is a great way to stay in touch with them!"" Computers have websites including Facebook and Myspace that can help people stay in touch and find family and friends. It has come to my realization to find that many people would live lonely lives if they could not internet with friends. But with the computer's help, people are lively and happy, including those with friends! Although computers are good for this, they may be addictive. I know people that may be able to have computer addiction. But on the other hand, I feel that the individual can make their own decisions in what is right. If people want to spend countless hours sitting in front of the glowing technology then so be it. Not one person should be forced to avoid computers; it is simply unconstitutional. Most people, including myself, understand that computers are a beneficial and fantastic source of technology. One out of one thousand people in the world are addicted to computers. Therefore, from the small number, we are able to see that computers are far from addicting. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They teach, help people stay in touch, and are not addicting. Therefore they are very beneficial to the world, its people, and technology."
1185	1188	1	3	If you ask me, computers are going to soon be a big problem in our lifestyles. Computers are just another material thing everyone has and seems to be benefiting from, but they aren't. This technology is taking away people's freedom and will and they don't even notice it. It is pretty clear to me things need to change. To begin, the computer is yet another distraction to our daily lives. I think that it is safe to admit that we don't need this. Distractions like these keep us from doing the things we need to do, such as exercise. Everyone wants to get their extra weight off, but they can't because they want to check a website or talk to their friends. So it's pretty much a lazy distraction. Would you really want to give up your health because of something so materialistic? If we keep clicking, more than fifty percent of the population that are fit and healthy will become obese. I think we need to reform this problem soon, like not promoting websites on so many TV networks, or having a computer shutdown week, anything that will get people to be outside enjoying life as they should. To continue, have you ever found yourself asking your kids how to work the computer? Don't you see how sad that is? Our future leaders are already glued to the games, email and instant messaging of the net. It's plain to see they are already spending too much of their time online. This is a concerning fact because more and more kids each year turn in less and less school work because they have better things to do such as chat with their friends or watch funny videos online. It's a scary thought because these children are our future leaders. This is a critical point in their lives. They need to learn about things now so their futures aren't hanging by a thread. Instead of making a habit of going online everyday why not make a habit like trying to get all your homework done each night? Things in children's lives need to change before they pay for it later in life. To sum it up, many things about our lifestyles need to change, whether it be in school work or losing weight. So I think it would be best if we took out, or lessened our computer usage to lower the distraction and focus more on life without revolving our world around a click.
1186	1189	1	3	Proven by @PERSON2 that the best @CAPS1 major over @PERCENT1 of children either have desktops, laptops, or some type of internet access. What do you think about this? Well I think the computers are taking up people's time, like children's, and not letting them get their work done. Also, computers are not only letting people talk to their friends, but they are causing @CAPS5 bullying. Finally, @CAPS1 are also just making parents more stressed out because they have to pay another bill for internet. Children nowadays come home, change, and log right into the computer and start talking to friends and listening to music; all this sounds good until their report cards come back and they see they are failing half their classes. I remember when my friend @CAPS3 would go home, change, eat, and log right inside the computer. As days went around to the end of the year, she noticed she had two problems. She was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes. She noticed that getting on the computer was not necessary so for the next month and a half she cut down on her time on the @CAPS1, did her homework, and started exercising; this pushed me to believe that children have @CAPS1. Proven by @PERSON3 the cyber bully that over @PERCENT2 of children have been cyber bullied or have @CAPS5 bullied someone. All this happens when children are not being watched or get bored and decide to pick on someone. What should we do people ask @PERSON1 and she says well take away the @CAPS1. I remember when I read about the year old girl on news channels.com and it was about @CAPS5 bullied but she never told anyone. This shows that children all over the world can be getting cyber bullied at any moment, and we must be aware of this danger.
1187	1190	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers are a waste of time! People that say they are helpful are just using that as an excuse. Some people say they are good for research and talking to people. Both of these things you can do without a computer. Computers are just a money-wasting thing that get in your way of life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper than using the computer. In this economy why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same thing? Also on a computer you don't really talk to the person; you are really just typing words to them. This can be very dangerous. Who knows if the person talking to you is really the person you think? Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercise. If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obesity is already rising with the number of fast food places and computers are making it worse. And the worst part is parents don't care; some children go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day and their parents don't encourage them to go outside. Children need encouragement to get moving or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this or before you know it @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obese. Another excuse that computer lovers use is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this @MONTH1 be true there are other ways you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also not everything on the internet is true so you might have false information. By getting a book you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them overnight; it @MONTH1 take a month or two but if we act now we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without them very easily, and without them the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer. If you are stuck on a computer for @NUM1 hours a day you will never have any family memories. All you will remember is when you were on the computer, and who wants that kind of life?
1188	1191	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you think that children spend too much time on the computer. The issue that is going around is @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exercising. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is something that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books @CAPS2 the same thing. I know a lot of people feel that computers have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exercising. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet than go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk show it was said that, ""In @LOCATION1 people are a lot over weight"", and it was also said that the number of over weight people in the world was the size of @LOCATION2"". So I believe that people should get off the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye coordination, you could be outside learning it. Again instead of just sitting at the computer you're outside running around having fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're finished they start playing games on the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sites all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can @CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only wastes your money to buy a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your decision. @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effects on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to learn about other places than the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exercising than they @CAPS2 on the computer. Now it is time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know the truth."
1189	1192	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. First reason is they give the ability to learn about people and places in the world. Another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world. Last reason is it can help you be organized and get a job. Now I will move on to give more details on my first reason. When I have a school project on a famous person or somewhere in the world I know that the computer will give me more information than a book. If I am doing the project on a place and I want to know how far it is from where I live to there or what's the weather of that place, all I have to do is type it down in a search engine and the computer will give me a bunch of websites that will answer my question. Now, if you can't draw a picture for your biography project, go on a search engine and type down the name of the person you're doing and don't forget to type down pictures or photos and you will see a bunch of pictures of that person. Now I will move on to my second reason. Computers bring unity in the nation and the world; for example think about these social networks like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3; these networks have millions of people on them that you can talk to. And what about the @ORGANIZATION1 webcam, where you can talk to the person face to face. Just recently there been earthquakes in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3; you can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need. Now I will move on to my last reason. Computers are everywhere; there's never a job that does not have a computer. That means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be essential for your future career and success in life.
1190	1193	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, Computers lately have been considered a distraction and unnecessary device. I personally think that they have many things to offer everyone; they help us understand things and subjects we couldn't understand before. Also computers are now said to make people lazy or physically unfit but that depends on the person. They could easily go to play and talk with family and friends if they wanted to. Computers are also becoming an important tool for learning, making information easier to access than before. The most popular and common use of a computer now is communication. Websites are invented on the main idea of communicating. Computers are an important part of the future life that isn't harmful or unnecessary. Recently we have been able to use computers in so many helpful ways, from learning and studying new and important things to researching and collecting data to cure a disease or working on a machine. They are now an important and useful part of jobs people have now. Almost anything published or shown to the public went through a computer. So people's jobs depend on computers for working and learning. Like a job where you print out a paper every week or even every day, you use computers to edit and put together your paper before printing. So basic computer skills are important for people to have for new jobs and common ones you see everyday. Computers are rumored also to be too time consuming and unhealthy for a person. Computers are an optional thing for people to use in their own time; they are not required to do everything. The person could go out and see friends and family, go to the gym, or take a vacation without a computer. Yes they are fun to use and they have a lot of things to do, but they aren't needed like air or water. You can live without using a computer for a week. You can take a walk, read a book, go hangout with your family and won't be pressured for computer time at all. If you're worried about it, take a break from it for a while. You can do things without a computer. Learning with computers is a thing lately; in @CAPS2 they're going in the computer lab learning to read on computers or other programs, studying or writing essays in my grade mostly, and researching for a class and making a project. Computers are useful in school. You also read about new subjects and learn new things on computers, possibly helping you in your classes. The biggest use of computers now is communication through many websites like youtube, facebook, myspace and many others. They allow people to communicate their ideas and opinions, talk to far away friends and family without a high phone bill, and see politics and daily news or the weather. Almost all means of communication can be done with a computer. So now you see computers are a vital and useful piece of daily technology we have at our reach. It is not unhealthy or time consuming unless you are allowing your computer usage to be that way.
1191	1194	1	3	"Letter to the @CAPS1 I disagree with the so-called ""experts"" that claim that computers could have negative effects on people. The idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a pathetic arguement. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 allow @CAPS22 with all your friends @CAPS4 and other online games help you met new people that could be hundreds of miles away from you! Twiter is good when you just want to say something quick like ""@CAPS5 to @LOCATION1"". @CAPS18 allows you to talk to friends, comment on their videos, and subscribe to them, plus it provides hours of entertainment without a fee. Computers also can provide fun games and entertain users. There are many free games, like @PERSON1, that have endless possibilities. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 (made by @CAPS6) claims to be the most popular @CAPS7 (@CAPS8 @CAPS9 Online @CAPS10-playing @CAPS11) on the web. You can level up combat skills: attack, defence, strength, ranged, and magic. Or you can level up skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. @PERSON1, like most @CAPS4, has quests, with varying difficulties. For example, for one quest you have to kill a demon, but for another, just find a missing cat. There are over @NUM1 quests, and there are never fewer than @NUM2 people playing at a time. Some other notable @CAPS13 games are @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15, @CAPS16 of @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1. As you can see, the computer has an impressive list of entertaining @CAPS11 for all ages, not to mention sites like @CAPS18 or addicting games. Computers don't really affect exercising. That's a personal choice, so you have to choose between @CAPS2 or the basketball court. It's like saying that before we had computers or video @CAPS11 consoles, that a @CAPS20 board stopped kids from exercising. The computer doesn't actually stop us from exercising. It's our minds that do, and our judgement. If you have bad judgement, you'd stay inside all day tweeting and @CAPS21. With a good strong mind and willpower, you can overcome a bad decision and play sports or go to the gym. All it takes is good judgement. Just to recap what I've said, @CAPS22 is plenty on computers and there are many choices on how to do it. Many sites amuse us, and we should make use of that. Not to mention you can buy games like @CAPS16 of @CAPS17 or @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15 for your @CAPS13! Computers don't actually hinder exercising, all it takes is good judgement to get off that chair and exercise, proving that computers are a positive force in our lives."
1192	1195	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 having everything known to man at your fingertips. @CAPS4 having an endless source of information in your own home. Wouldnít you want all of this all the time? The question then is, do computers have positive effects on people? I strongly believe computers do benefit society. Firstly, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. The main way is by typing. When you type, you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys. Also, computer games teach hand-eye coordination. If you weren't looking at the screen, would it be possible to win the game? When computers teach you hand-eye coordination, you can use it for other things too. For example, you definitely need it in sports or more. Specifically, baseball. If you didn't have good hand-eye coordination, you wouldn't be able to catch the ball or be able to hit the ball when you swing. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Secondly, computers give people the ability to form about places and people. When people are deciding when to get vacation, they go in the internet. What there is in do. Why would you travel in a place is you back. Many use the internet in research other countries. When the eight grade did reports their information. Eighty seven percent the internet. Finally; some people say computers take away from interaction with family and friends, but computers actually allow you to tell with other family and friends around the world. Wouldn't it be wonderful to with your loved ones in a different state of country? The main way of online communication is @CAPS5-mail or @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These allow you to send someone a message faster and easier. It is much easier in remember someone @CAPS5-mail address than it is a phone settle for just talking, when you can actually see the person? It would be like them being in the room with you. Computers are a great way to talk to someone. Why wait any longer? Computers are a great way to refine your hand-eye coordination skills. You can research Faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe. Most importantly, you can communicate with family and friends online through @CAPS8, @CAPS5-mail, or @CAPS10. Definitely, computers benefit society. So go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive and essential tools for modern life.
1193	1196	1	3	Computers do not have a negitive effect on people. They keep you in touch with family, help you do work for school, also allow you to play video games and look up music. Computers can keep you in with family and friends. Find locations to where the live. How their doing and what have they been up to. It allows you to e-mail and lets you see friends that moved far away. Computers also help you to work for school. They help you find answeres to questions a teacher could ask. They help you write reports or reports in general for any subject. Also, there many site that you could go to; to help you with a book.The sites could also bring you to your schools website. That way, if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check. Even if you were absent most papers I questions are on the internet so you could make end to the homework. Another common thing computers are used ten is to weecth movies. Rather a old movie or a new release. Computers also do the same thing for music. Anything from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country and back can be. or new @CAPS3 shows and music all be find. Video games are also popular. Many people play these because; people can friends. Talk to friends that they havent seen in a long time. They to not be bored. If it's raining out and nothing to to the here games. And if you one to talk to thiers always someone there to lister to you and maybe become your friend. So computers are not a waste. They can keep you in touch, you new friends get rid of find an serches everything in @CAPS4 shows, music and movies, making them a valuable part of daily life.
1194	1197	1	3	Dear, Local Newspaper I think that it would be better if people get outside to get so exercise and enjoy nature to interacte with there family and friends. If you get out with your family and friends maybe more teens and adults would be in better shape and more healthly. Say we jump out of bed, gets some breakfast and head to the park to gets an excrize with your family and friends. Alot of family and friends i think spend way to much time on the computers or there labtops because if they are on the computer to long then they will not want to go outside and get excrise with there friends. More and more people use the computer. But not everybody agrees on this statement. What I think it would be better to solve the problem and have everybody get outside and get some freshair with family and friends. But some people don't think that is the right thing to go. People that think those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Well I don't think that is the way to go because you need to get outside to get some. Freshair with people. But if you want to go on the computer you can but I think it should be only for a little bit then because some people have a bissness that they have to work on when they are at work. Sometimes people have to work on there computer every day so if that is the case they I think they should be alouded to use the labtop or computer. But if you are a teen you should only go on if you have to f you needing the internent or writeing a paper. But if you going to go on to just go on to just talk to friend then that is a waste of time in somebody life. Well at least my life it is. I think as a teen you shold be to work on studying on doing your homework instead of being on the computer because I think it would be better to make sure your grade are not making you fail in your school carvee in life. So that is why it is best to make sure you aren't on the computer all the time talking to your friends on the computer all day because it could make you fail in life. I would only go on for a little bit to talk to your friends. That is why I think it is not right to spend all your time on the computer. Jump outside and in goal the outside weather with friends and family meabers. I hope teen and adult get outside from now on because it would be better for allof us and everybody would be heathly. If they tri this program. If you tri this program it will really work to all of you tri proise it will work and you will be heathly and not feel bad about yourself, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
1195	1198	1	3	Dear to whom this @MONTH1 concern I know everybody that dont uses computers are why are people effect by the computers. Well i think computer is better then newspaper, on news papers you could find the news, well of course but wheather, houses for sale, tv casting, jobs and others just the same way as @CAPS1 but instead it like virtual. It benefits society for certain reasons it depends. some times computerscan be a negative effects on people but it also teach people how to read, write, type, learn and other. What I about we can talk to others we can see pictures of people whom we no we can google into about things we need to no, it helps when they need to find they way around the mapquest. A negative issue with having computers with internet, certain websites that are not age able. Kids be on website thier parents dont bout, looking up with boys they meet over the @CAPS1, People dying making plans with someone the next day the person is gone missing. I think if experts take away computers must kids well be mad and upset and there will be nothing more to do but play video games and go outside and these are my opinions on the complex role of computers in our society today.
1196	1199	1	3	Computers are helpful in everyone's life. New things can be learned from them, such as historical facts or scientific concepts. They can provide a way to contact others through various platforms. And they make writing a lot easier by offering digital tools. Overall, they have a good effect on the world. Technology lets everyone explore new topics with ease. If something is typed into a search engine, results will pop up within seconds. Click on these, and information that is needed is displayed, from articles to videos. The computer is also helpful for research papers, allowing for efficient source gathering. The internet allows a more elaborate final draft through editing software. Learning benefits a grade in school or in work by improving outcomes. It is always good to be able to contact anyone who is wanted. With the computer, people are able to send emails, talk on social media, or even talk to a loved one on a webcam. On these platforms, pictures can be added so anyone who wasn't able to be at an event can now see what it was like. Webcams hooked up to the computer let people talk face to face with someone else they might not have seen in months. These are all good examples of why computers have a positive impact on the human race. Writing out papers can be a hard, tedious task. On the computer, it is possible to type out words and not have to get out an eraser for any spelling mistakes. These are picked up by spell check, which underlines errors. This way, no points are deducted for wrong spellings, improving the final score. Sometimes people have sloppy handwriting that is difficult to read. These difficulties can all be solved by a typing program on the computer, producing a clean document. Therefore computers must have a positive effect on people. They teach new things through online courses and tutorials. They allow people to contact others who are far away, bridging distances. They can also make grading a paper easy for teachers with clear text. This concludes that computers benefit the society we live in today.
1197	1200	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it has been brought to my attention that on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside. The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers, rather than enjoying the day. Computers are negatively affecting the local population. We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutely crazy if nothing is done about this. For one, the region has the most obese children in the world. Generally children should be running around burning off their calories; even some people in their teen years should be active. Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such. Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day. The whole screen thing brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain, what computers cause a significant number of child seizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer, with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that everytime you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk. The longer you're on the more and more and more radiation is going to your brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself, it could almost be called suicide because if you're reading this than you've been warned. So we've basically covered the effects that computers have on your body physically. The computer can also effect you mentally and socially. When a long vacation comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose a large percentage of everything you learned in school. Its been proven that computers cause memory loss. So what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on, frustrating isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could've gained knowledge rather than using it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer, would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. Its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you.
1198	1201	1	3	Dear editor, Computers are becoming more and more prevalent in the community. People are spending too much time on computers instead of on other activities, an effect not beneficial to society. Because of computers, people have lacked exercise, missed enjoying nature and other parts of the world and forgotten about interacting with family and friends. Computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives. First of all, computer users receive significantly less exercise than those who do not use computers. According to a survey done by a health organization only a small percentage of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week. In contrast, a much larger percentage of non-computer users (non-frequent computer users) reported that they exercised at least once every week. Can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user? Nearly everybody would be overweight, lethargic from lack of sleep due to hours on the computer, and unworldly. Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone's life, and lacking it could be deleterious to one's health. Hopping off the computer and instead getting exercise, would make for a healthier and more fit country. Not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise, but they also prevent people from enjoying nature and other parts of the world. By traveling to new and unfamiliar places in the world, one is able to experience and learn about other cultures. Going on the internet may be a decent way to learn about other places, but actually feeling the ambiance and environment of a foreign place allows for a much more profound understanding of another place. For example, when I went to a foreign country for a vacation, I learned about the differences in traditions and culture. I saw the separation between the poor and the rich when I looked from humble shacks along the river to the portentous, elegant edifices scraping the sky. It was an experience I could not encounter on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer, but through the screen of one's eyes. Lastly, computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends. From my personal experiences, I tend to ignore friends and family when I am focused on the screen. Speaking, playing, and generally socializing with others is a critical part of everyone's life. Without this basic necessity people cannot be happy. In summary, computers should not be used in excess. This sort of use could lead to people getting less exercise, not fully experiencing the world, and loss of interaction with friends and family. To make a better country and nation, the people of the community should make an effort to reduce computer use.
1199	1202	1	3	Dear Newspaper I think that computers have a positive effect on people, here are my reasons. You can get in contact with people, if you have a question you can look it up and you can do your job on a computer. I think that these reason will have you positive too. Many people like computers and have one. My first reason is you can get in touch with friends and family. I think this is a good reason because if your grandmother lives in another state you don’t want to drive there every time you want to see her when you live in your own state. You would use the computer to live chat with her so you wouldn't have to drive all the way down there. If you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her. You would use a computer to get in touch with friends as well. If you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it quickly. That is my first reason why computers have a positive way on people. My second reason is if you have a computer you can look up questions that you would have. If you needed to know something for a big report and none of your friends are up you can look up your computer for answers. Computers can help you so much if you need an answer right away. If you didn't have a computer it would be so hard to do stuff like that. That is why I think that computer can answer your questions effectively. My third reason is you can work on the computer. If you're a stay at home mom you can work on the computer to handle finances and pay bills online. A lot of people work on the computer to save the environment by reducing paper use. When I grow up I’ll probably work on the computer because it is easier for many jobs. That is why I think that you can work on the computer productively. The reason I picked were you can get in touch with family and friends, you can look up a question that you might have, and you can work on a computer. I hope you have a positive way on computers they help you out in daily life. People might think that they rot your brain not they don’t help and knowledge you. Many people like and have one in their homes. I think that you should have a positive way on computers too after considering these points.
1200	1203	1	3	Dear Editor, many people at my school sit on their computers after school. They don't go outside and enjoy nature. They don't visit with family and friends or even exercise. Many people are affected by this. Going outside can enhance your knowledge, you can go on a walk in the woods. When you are on your walk you might find interesting new species of insects or plants. Also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings. Often times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids, you can start a pick up game of baseball. You can also build new things outdoors. You could find a big tree and build a treehouse or tire swing with your family. Going outside leaves you with a lot of fun activities to enjoy. When kids sit on the computer they don't interact with their family or friends. During the summer you can go to the beach with your friends. It will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner. You might also find the opportunity to go to a different state for the day. Or you could go across the country to see your sick grandma or your newly named cousin. Going on a picnic will give you time to get to know new people. You could invite friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to meet. You will also have a lot of tasty food and who wouldn't want that? Going places with your family and friends can lead to a worth wild experience. A large percentage of kids chose to go on the computer than to exercise. Kids will become overweight from this lack of activity. When on the computer many kids will eat snacks constantly. Eating for hours each day is not a good idea for your health. You can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country. Once you are on the team you will make new friends, and get your exercise for the day. When you are on a team and exercising you will learn valuable life skills. You will learn the benefits of working as a team and by yourself. So getting your exercise is a very important role in your life. Why would you choose the computer? You wouldn't be able to enjoy the outdoors. Or spend time with family and friends. You would become over weight and unhappy. So, don't choose the computer, choose another activity that promotes health and happiness!
1201	1204	1	3	"To @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS2 I have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly disagree, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Having computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about @CAPS3 and faraway places and even allow people to talk online with friends or family. Don't you want your children to grow up with great hand-eye coordination? More than @PERCENT1 parents voted yes. As shown in many statistics, adults and children that use the computer for an hour or more a day have better hand-eye coordination than a normal adult or child that only uses @CAPS6 once a week. By using the computer for more than one hour a day your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase. Not only does typing quicker effect your computer techniques but @CAPS6 also helps you outside of your home like in sports. For exsample, if you play the sport baseball, the speed of your pitch will increase over @PERCENT2 if you use the computer for over a hour a day! If your a batter your racation to the pitch will also increase by over @PERCENT2! Just by using computer. Is time running out for your @CAPS3 project to be do? Without computers, you wouldn't get the information you need quick enough. Dr. @DR1 from @ORGANIZATION1 state ""You can get the same information on people other countries, and @CAPS3 from the computer as you can from a book, but it is easier and faster."" By using the computer you get the information as easily as from a book and it is more convenient. In addition, you have to buy books to get their information unlike computers where they dont require you to pay to look up the information you need, making it inexpensive, dont settle for less get the best! Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with. By having a computer you can chat with them through your webcam! Instead of calling them up or sending them an email you could chat with them and still see them in the flesh! Several computer owners say, ""@CAPS5 like your actually hanging out with them!"" @CAPS6 takes over @NUM1 days at least to recieve a letter back or an email from them if they live faraway with computers @CAPS5 instant communication! Wouldn't you like to talk to friends and family every day instead of waiting around for a call, email, or letter? I think yes. All in all , having computers is a great investment. I would also like to point out that without computers you wouldn't beable to talk with friends/family online, get better hand-eye cordination, or even have the ability to learn about @CAPS3 in just a click of a button! Isn't this what you want?"
1202	1205	1	3	"Dear Newspaper editor, Have you ever been working on a paper, or reading something and theres that word you've never heard before? And you just cant figure it at? There where a computer can help you. Yes, some people do waste all their time, online but they have issues. Computers help us with all of our school projects and get research. You can @CAPS3 reconnect woth old friends that you havent sen in years, learned many good things with the internet and computers. First off we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers. @CAPS1 us school projects, I use @ORGANIZATION1 word and powerpoint all the time. Our teachers prefer us to do that instead of handwriting evert thing. Getting information on the computer is so much faster and easier I mean the time it would take, you to look up the word ""elephants"" the encyclopedia is probably @NUM1 times more that it takes to it in can google. Plus there about @NUM2 1/@NUM2 seconds google call all up millions of websites just what ""elephants"". Another reason way computers are very beneficial is you can reconnect the old friends you havent seen or talked for a years. You can @CAPS3 meet new people and @CAPS1 us dating and facebook especially is three things and theres websites like twitter where you can follow celebrities and @CAPS2, computers are internet gives great information people. Some kids take online @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that does recieves around computers to do really have a choice. So in conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to lets of people I know its not a good thing to sit there all day and play cmputer games, but we lets of things accomplished, like school projects, or any project really. Its @CAPS3 nice to meet up with someone you havent talked to in a while sometimes. We have learned many great things from the internet. I hopre you consider my opinion and see how computers help with schoolwork and connecting with others."
1203	1206	1	3	"Dear editor @ORGANIZATION2 the source, @CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers. This is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health, safety and education. To open my statements, overuse @ORGANIZATION2 the computer con lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1 and plays games, goes on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely gets any excersize and he almost never sees daylight. @PERSON1 @LOCATION1 gained @NUM1 pounds, which lead to obeisity and heart problems. He even wears wooden teeth because his general hygene declined as well. Another common health problem that developes from excessive use @ORGANIZATION2 the computer is arthrietis. Dr. @PERSON3 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION1 told @ORGANIZATION3, ""The massive amounts @ORGANIZATION2 typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthrietis, and other joint related problems."" In fact, a study that took place from @DATE2 to @DATE3 to see the long lasting terms @ORGANIZATION2 computer overuse had some shocking results. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain. These health risks are a concern, but peoples safety is on bigger issue. When people excessively use the computer they put their safety and well being at risk. People have had serious injuries and scams placed on them because @ORGANIZATION2 the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2. She met a man on @CAPS4.com named @PERSON6, who persuaded her into meeting him at an airport. From their she was taken to @CAPS5 and held from ransom. Every time people use their computer, they put themselves at risk. Dr. @PERSON4 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION2 claims, ""I @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 internet-related kidnappings & other crimes. The victim was a person who overused the computer and frequented the internet. Safety is one @ORGANIZATION2 the most important things in life. But peoples education is also effected. When people overuse the computer they can impact their education. The internet hold false information and can be a waste @ORGANIZATION2 peoples time. When students are working on a report, they very often use the internet to get information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are most commonly used. This can be a big problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 information on the internet is wrong? Thats more than half @ORGANIZATION2 it! The internet can also be a time waster. My bro, @PERSON2, had on assignment to do @DATE1. He stood up @NUM3 hours using @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay. He recieved a zero on that grade. In closing, overusing your computer can cause health problems, put your safety at risk, and hurt your education, which is why moderation is so crucial."
1204	1207	1	3	Dear editor, Have you ever used a computer? Odds are you have, which means you know how convienient and positive computers are. Did you know @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 use computers regularly? These technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn, showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people. Who hasn't ever played a game on a computer? Computers provide many forms of entertianment, such as games, music, and videos. I once has to drive @NUM1 hours to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer, that I played games and watched movies on. Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities. Of course, try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling @NUM2 @CAPS2, which is computers positively affect me. It was @NUM3 on a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was just about to have a baby. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were there to witness this baby coming into the world because the all live on the other side of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS3, this minor set back did not prevent them from seeing the @LOCATION1 baby, and thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer many ways to be social, such as social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born. there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convienient for all. Last but not least, computers are not only a fine tool for school, but are necessary to succeed with your education. One snows day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. Too bad I didn't know one thing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to take out some books for my report but due to the snow, the library's power went out and therefore they were closed. This was not an issue, though, beacuse I only had to spend @NUM5 minutes on a computer searching for information, instead of spending hours browsing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many helpful purposes for people. These marvelous machines can provide entertainment, socialize with people around the world, and even provide information on any topic you would like. @ORGANIZATION1 readers, now you understand why computers are positive for your lives and everyone elses. I encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone, so they know all the benefits to using computers and how they improve our daily lives.

1206	1209	1	3	Computers have many positive effects on people these days, most of which are very good and can lead to you becoming more self-confident. Computers can educate people, from learning about some ancient historical figure to completing complex school projects. Also, computers entertain people too, offering a wide array of activities. Lastly, they can even increase your chances of finding a job or helping out with your current work. For most people, education is very important, but since kids don't stay in school all day, they often use the computer to learn; kids can learn about other places and cultures through interactive programs and websites. This benefits us because we're learning something new and growing our knowledge base. Also, kids can efficiently do their projects, for example, writing an essay, researching their science fair project, and so on. Lastly, kids can learn about people from other times, such as famous musicians from long ago, historical celebrities, legends, and hall of famers. People always look for some kind of entertainment, and the first place they often go is the computer. Everyone likes entertainment, and the computer is often the best plan. They could play a variety of games, from games based on the past or games set in the future. There is also a whole bunch of genres: multiplayer, puzzle, castle defense, sports, racing, arcade, and so on. Another fun thing to do is interact with friends online or even talk to family members who don't live near you. Lastly, you could watch funny videos, sad videos, and music videos. Another way that computers affect people is in their prospects of finding a job or getting help with their career. The computer can teach people what they will do on their job and what to expect from their role. Also, it can let you search for available jobs in your local area or beyond. Finally, it can help them by allowing them to create a professional web page or portfolio. In conclusion, computers have profoundly helped people. They can increase their education, give them entertainment, and even help out with their job or help them find a new one.
1207	1210	1	3	There have been many advancements in computer technology, and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it. I am against it and I will tell you why. You spend less time exercising, which means you'll gain weight. You spend less time enjoying nature, which means you're lost with anything natural, and you spend less time with friends and family which probably proves you are disconnected. I am not saying the computer is a bad thing, but too much of it certainly is. First, you spend less time exercising. If you don't exercise you gain weight, you miss out on most of the physical activities you could have done, and you risk your health. This is a bad thing because you are not yourself anymore and if it goes too far you can't even move around easily. So if this sounds scary, you should plan your time on the computer so it doesn't happen to you; time is so limited that we waste it on stuff on computers, so think before you go on the computer—maybe you can go for a jog outside instead. Next, you spend less time enjoying nature. Nature is so beautiful but it is being destroyed and we do nothing. There are only a few hundred, maybe a few thousand, people who truly help the environment, and if you think about it, that is not a lot compared to the billions of people on earth. It is a crying shame to see something so beautiful die while most of us do nothing to help. Finally, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most important reason of all, the main course if you will. Your family is so important because they are your best friends in the whole wide world. Your friends are important to them. Your family might leave you if you dedicate your life to the computer; if you ignore them they might feel neglected, so be careful. Your friends are just as important as your family; they both make you laugh, have good times with you, and cheer you up when you are upset. Just don't forget that as time goes by. Well, there you have it, my three reasons for being against working on the computer too much, and they all sound like good reasons, so let's recap it all, shall we? First, you spend less time exercising, which is very important. Next, you spend less time enjoying nature, which is also very important. Finally, you spend less time with friends or family, the most important of all. So I hope you enjoyed my essay and you've learned something from it. So remember, too much of a good thing is bad, and I'll just leave you with that thought.
1208	1211	1	3	Dear editor: Did you know that a significant percentage of people in the world have computers? These computers are definitely benefitting society. People need computers to get updated on important issues, contact others, and learn new information. Computers are necessary for everyday life. It's very important that news gets around, and one way for it to do that is by computers. Average people like me and you need to know the weather, global issues, and many other important topics. If you use the computer to get updated on important issues you will be able to access the information right away. For example, there is no need to wait for the weather to come on the television when you can find out the weather for your local area within seconds. Just recently there was an earthquake in a remote region and millions of civilians were affected. If a natural disaster was to happen somewhere nearby, people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated. Not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues, but it is also a great way to contact people. My relatives live very far away and we can't afford the long distance phone call charge, and so we e-mail them. A vast number of people contact far away friends and family by e-mail! The computer is also a great place for friends to contact each other through social networking sites, such as popular platforms. People need to interact with other people and the internet is a fantastic place to do that. Finally, computers can also be used to learn new information. If children need to find information for a project or essay they can easily search the internet and find an answer. Kids need to access the information that is necessary for school on the internet. Computers are useful for adults as well. If adults want to learn something new, all they have to do is search it on the computer. It's so much easier than going out to the library and finding that information in a book. Did you know that most adults use an online dictionary to find the definition of a word? Computers can find every answer to your questions. In conclusion, computers are really benefitting society. Computers can update you on important issues, help you contact people, and find out new information. These advances in technology are good for human society.
1209	1212	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Having home computers is a good thing for many reasons. One reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people. People can also use computers to type and save paper. Also, people can use computers to talk to people living close or far away from you. Finally, computers can save paper by replacing books. One of the most important reasons why people need computers is because computers can help you learn about and research other things going on in the world. If a student needs to research a country and write a paper about it for school, it is much easier and faster to use a computer than to look through a textbook. Computers are also better and faster than a textbook if you want to know more about a person or a culture. Using computers to type is also faster than writing a paper by hand. Using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper. When you are typing a paper, you don't have to worry about your handwriting or breaking your pencil. You also don't have to worry about spelling something wrong because computers can check your spelling and grammar. When you are writing a paper by hand you have to think about all these problems and more. You also have to spend money on pencils and other writing supplies. Computers also saved people money because they didn't need to buy as much paper to make textbooks. Computers also evolved how people can communicate with each other. Before computers were invented, you couldn't easily talk to people in other countries unless you paid to use a phone or sent them mail. Now, you can send instant mail which saves days of time and paper. You can also use webcams to talk to family members and people you don't know. That can save you a lot of money because you don't have to pay money for postage stamps, phone calls, or plane rides to visit them. Those are some of the best reasons why having a home computer is better than not having one. A home computer can save you time when you want to research a country, person, or culture. They can save you money because you don't have to buy postage stamps, pay for phone calls, or pay for plane rides to visit someone from a different state or country. Computers also help save paper because you no longer need to make large textbooks or use a different piece of paper when you make a writing mistake.
1210	1213	1	3	In my opinion, I agree that it benefits society. The reasons that support my decision are that lots of businesses use computers to work, fast food restaurants use computers, and schools use computers. Computers are all needed just for those reasons. My first reason is businesses use computers to work. Workers use computers for designing, filing people's names, and to type papers and essays. People in the designing industry don't use paper and pencil anymore, because they use designing software to work. Instead of filing in a cabinet, people and workers use computers to store information about their patients, clients, and workers. Computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can. People also type papers and essays for work. For example, news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it published. Workers in business need to use computers to file documents, type reports, and design items like clothes and games. My second reason is that fast food restaurants or even sit-down restaurants use computers, instead of using old cash registers. For example, major chains use technology to type in people's orders and the amount they pay. Back then they used to use cash registers, and to get money out they needed to click a button, but now they have everything secured and managed using computers. Every restaurant has at least a touch screen computer in it to use. So restaurants need computers to survive in the modern world. My third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports, and to file the students' names and grades into a system. Students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work. Teachers need computers to file the students' names, grades, and information, instead of using a physical filing cabinet. Teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off from word processors. So schools use and need computers for both students and teachers. In conclusion, I agree that computers benefit society, because businesses need them to work, design, and file, and fast food restaurants need them so they can take people's orders, and they are used in schools for students and teachers. So that's why it benefits society.
1211	1214	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Computers are necessary and benefit our community. They do a great deal to help make our lives easier. There is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another. The benefits of our computers are they connect us, they spread news, and they make every day objects work. Computers connect us in so many different ways. Where would businesses be without computers? Most modern day businesses are run by computers. Owners can now have businesses all over the world. With computers a business in @LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @LOCATION1. They can have live video chats together, sharing documents and data in real time. With the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world. Even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers. Now a days we do a lot of online shopping. This is an example of how stores connect to their customers. Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations and special promotions. This can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop. The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. With all these computers many social networking sites are born. The most popular right now is @CAPS1. Students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries. We have a live chat on @CAPS1 or even @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is instant messaging which is, well, instant. With a simple click people are connected no matter how far apart they are. Therefore, computers connect people. Computers also broadcast news. Without the computers most of us would not know about world news. This includes the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 they would be in a lot more trouble. They would not have all of these donations and support from around the globe. Also computers even broadcast national news. Almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too. Any day now they will be completely online. This will drastically change how we learn about news. It would just be a click away. What would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds. Science also benefits from computers. Phones now can be personal TVs, internet, and messaging devices. Phones are just a tiny version of a computer. Cars also have computers put into them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Also, in cars there are computers to run just about everything else, from engine performance to climate control. So, there is not a day where we do not encounter computers. In conclusion, computers benefit us in so many ways. They connect us, deliver news, and are in almost all of our technology. Could you imagine life without computers?
1212	1215	1	3	"Do you know that square box with a screen on @CAPS11? Or that rectangular shaped object with letters on @CAPS11? Or that other rectangular box where you put a disk, a usb, and you turn @CAPS11 on at. All that is a computer. Yes! @CAPS11 is fun, you @CAPS3 play games, go on internet, watch videos, and check your mail. If you had a computer everything would be easy but @CAPS2 not. @NUM1 reasons why is if you have kids and they go on your computer you have at home @CAPS11 @CAPS3 cause them addiction, @CAPS11 @CAPS3 be inappropriate, and @CAPS11 could be expensive. Please hear my reasons and give me a fighting chance. The first reason why computers are bad because @CAPS11 @CAPS3 cause addiction to your child. @CAPS12 a problem because your child bothers you and says, ""@CAPS1 or @CAPS7 @CAPS3 I go on the computer please"". And you say yes and when you let them on they will be happy when you say. ""@CAPS2 time to get off the computer"" they will say ""@CAPS3 I stay on just for a little longer or I don't wanna get off @CAPS4 in a middle of a game."" @CAPS5 when they finally get off and their next day they will ask you again ""@CAPS6 or @CAPS7 @CAPS3 I go on the computer"" and if you say ""@CAPS8"" they will cry and throw a temper tantrum. And the more you let them on the more they will wanna stay @CAPS9 if you say, ""@CAPS8"" you will get a fight. The second reason why @CAPS2 a bad thing to have a computer is because @CAPS11 @CAPS3 be inappropriate, @CAPS11 @CAPS3 be inappropriate because your child is growing up he or she will go into the internet and look at things like nude pictures or videos about a or a that world to lead your child having sexual intercourse. There you will but at the age of @NUM2 to @NUM3 years old and you they of inappropriate a computer @CAPS3 do. @CAPS9 last but not least the last reasons why a computer is bad because they are computers cost about @MONEY1 more a days and you @CAPS3 bought your computer and @CAPS11 will cost you a lot to get @CAPS11 fixed or to get a new one and they will be on @CAPS11 even more or they @CAPS3 mess @CAPS11 up trust me I know. @CAPS5 @CAPS12 why a computer isn't always a good thing. Now that you have heard my reasons I hope you take this info considerations and think about @CAPS11 you really want a computer or not they are good and easy but they also have some bad side effects. All the facts are true and I say about @NUM4 people in the world go through computers every year @CAPS5 think hard. Do you really need one?"
1213	1216	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely useful tool in this modern age. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. Therefore, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master. Without it they will have sloppy handwriting, absolutely no chance at sports, and much more. Computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees. And because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in unison to type faster. Computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places, people, etc. People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. Now that information is only a few clicks away. Say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps dripping but you don't want to pay for a plumber. You could easily find step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. Finally, Computers can allow people to stay in contact with friends who @MONTH1 live far away. It is more convenient than using a plane because you don't have to have something in your hands the whole time. You can walk away and then come back when you hear that you got a message. It is also very useful for people such as businessmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @PERSON1, author of business magazine tells us in an interview that it is nearly impossible to run a successful business without a computer. How people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, I don't know. But I hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necessary for our modern way of life.
1214	1217	1	3	I think having computers are good because you can use it to find places. Another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer. You can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework. That is why computers are good and we need them. First reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us. Also we could look at places we never saw before and if you want to get some where you can go the computer to do that, typing in an address to get directions instantly. You can see pictures of the location and even check the traffic. Computers make it easy to explore the world from your home. They help us learn, communicate, and navigate our daily lives. In conclusion, computers are helpful tools that make many tasks simpler and more convenient for everyone.
1215	1218	1	3	There are over @NUM1 students at @ORGANIZATION2. & out of @NUM2 students have computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. Students who use computers are more skilled than kids who don't by learning all the software and how to be safe when online. Computers teach kids hand eye coordination, which can come in handy when playing sports. Also they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Finally it allows people to talk online with other people. Computers make people develop hand eye coordination. When someone plays a sport like baseball or basketball, hand eye coordination is definitely needed. Say you're a catcher, and you need to catch the ball. Almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it. Hand-eye coordination can also be useful to people with jobs. If you work with computers for a job, it is helpful to be well known with the keyboard for fast results. Mostly any job along with sports requires hand-eye coordination. Some people have the gift that they have hand-eye coordination when they're born, but for people who don't practice is the best thing. Learning about faraway places and people is always fascinating. On computers towns can put up webpages with pictures, information or even ways to help you plan a vacation. There's also @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place. Computers even give you the ability to plan or visit a location by buying tickets online or maybe you just want to read what the place is like, you can do all that. Finally, computers can be taken any place with you and say you go to @LOCATION1, and you don't speak their language, well you can go to a translating site and figure out what things mean. Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, all of these sites make it possible for you to talk with other people. Personally, I have a facebook, aim, and even a e-mail. A lot of the time I will go on facebook and talk to my friends from school and even my cousins that I don't get see a lot. Talking online helps you interact with other people that you might not see in school or around town, and also your friends that might not have a cell phone. It helps you learn social skills that everyone needs. Computers give you all that. Its easy and free way to talk to anyone you know whenever you want. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. Almost everyone uses computers, and they aren't difficult to use. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best things that has ever been made for communication and learning.
1216	1219	1	3	Dear editor, I have read your past article about how computers can take too much time out of some ones life, time they could be using to exercise or on other activities. This is completely untrue and in many ways actually benefits society. The internet is a fast and simple way to shorten the time spent doing activities we would already do. Instead of sending a letter to someone to invite them to the movies you could just email them. Letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly. Also what if the movie sells out or is canceled, don't worry with the internet you can reschedule and buy tickets online so that doesn't happen again. Suddenly your phone rings, its a call from your best friend saying to turn on the news, but you have to leave to pick up your kids in three minutes. Instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and repeat, you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early. Have you been dying to talk to someone you haven't seen in a long time? Well with one of the many free websites like Skype and Facebook you can do that in a heart beat. You can talk to that person and find many others. Also if you've been feeling lonely, like you can't find the right person, with dating sites you can find the perfect person and maybe go to the movies with them. Not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically. According to research at the National Institute of Health, people who use computers for at least thirty minutes a day have a fifteen percent increase in hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and accuracy. Although some say it's bad for your eyes that is a lie, it was proven by Dr. Evans, a respected expert, instead of being harmful to health who has multiple degrees in science and health. Therefore, the evidence clearly shows that computers are a beneficial tool for modern life.
1217	1220	1	3	To whom it may concern: I will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside. However, it has kept kids inside instead of being on the streets causing trouble. Computers have become a part of our everyday life. Some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends. Experts say it's bad but the school gives us a computer class in education? We learn keyboarding skills, presentation techniques and how to research any topic. School itself has influenced computer use. If we could travel back in time, we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets. Now-a-days, kids spend a lot of time inside, on the computers. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I bet you, or your parents, or maybe even your grandparents used to hear about gangs or fights going on in the streets. Now that computers have become an important item in many people's lives you don't hear those types of things as much. I'm not saying they don't happen but you don't hear your child come home and talk about gangs and fights. Therefore, being on the computer isn't that bad. In history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to America to get away from their ruler. Well, not everyone was able to come. Some people have family in another country. Due to time difference, it is hard to stay in touch. My mother came over here when she was young. The rest of her family still lives in the home country. To stay in touch they email or video chat. The five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call. The invention of computers has made it easier to catch up with family! Most importantly, the use of computers is influenced in schools. My school has a computer class, where we learn how to skillfully type. We are also taught how to correctly cite and research work. This is helpful because if we don't know this information we could plagiarize and plagiarism is illegal. Frequently, teachers give us projects that ask for computer use, either we have to look something up for specific, accurate information or we have to type a formal document, as well as using the online textbook instead of taking it home. After reading all the facts, I'm sure you will agree that computers can benefit society. Students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home. People won't feel like they've left or lost their family. Schools influence computer use to help us learn. Certainly you cannot disagree with me on these points.
1218	1221	1	3	Dear Editor or Reader, Some people believe that computers are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend too much time on the computer. Computers are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic. Not only does the computer help communication but it also helps us gain information on modern day society like the news to stay up-to-date. This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out. One main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have occurred like an incident or an up coming event. Some experts like Dr. Miller, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obesity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life. A computer can give us certain information like news and weather report. These days every smart person would go search information on a computer for not only missed news but for future forecast on weather to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computer can send data to another computer to conveniently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computer. The computer can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture. You could send that file and listen to it on another computer. Now is the time to decide if you should support computers. The computer can help you talk to long lost friends at one touch of a button. If you need certain information than you could find it on a computer without ever leaving your comfortable home. Last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work. So go and type that letter to a representative to help people see that computers are good for our society and its progress.
1219	1222	1	3	Computers. First of all, I strongly believe that people should not use computers all the time. Staying up too late, like on a school day and you're tired, is a problem. Your eyes look at black & white words that can make you tired, forcing you to stay up, and drinking Red Bull, Monster, or any other energy drink when you're not suppose to. Second of all, almost the whole school uses the laptops, and the computers like seventy percent uses them. The other thirty percent is students and adults write on paper, and that has good hand and eye combination. The seventy percent is like all people go online, Facebook, YouTube, games, and Google. The thirty percent is all people use to write on their paper, and doodle on the background. Third of all, in other states people don't have internet service, or they can't use a computer. People have to write their work on a piece of paper. Some kids, young adults, adults, and students sometimes have bad hand writing. I think all people should not have a computer and should rely more on traditional methods for a healthier lifestyle.
1220	1223	1	3	In my opinion computers are good for people. I believe this because many people get to see things that on their daily basis wouldn't. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that many people now a days work a lot so they might not have time to remember little things such as going to buy newspaper or they might not even have time to watch the news on tv, but because of computers they can read or see the same things but in less time. Some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working. This benefits society in its own way. I believe computers are very useful to everyone. Computers can help people get in touch. They can keep in touch by using webcam and other tools. It could also let them communicate. Computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world. It gives people a chance to see the people you couldn't see from afar. In my opinion people can also learn from computers. Computers have many positive effects that are very important. They give people a chance to learn things. This can benefit society because the more knowledge people have the better it is. It gives people who didn't get a chance to learn what they wanted to actually do so and learn it. Computers do benefit society lets take Professor Adams for example he says that eighty percent of kids believe that computers have helped them in their own way. Many people can be bored at times but because of computers and the fun things it has such as games, videos, etc., people get to actually spend some time doing something. Like Professor Adams stated, kids believe computers are helpful because by playing those games it can give them hand eye coordination and help them in different ways at the same time, taking away boredom and letting them get good hand eye coordination. Computers also benefit society by letting people have such technology. Many times technology is needed in everyone's life. Technology has helped many people and still continues to. Computers is one of the technologies that helps people. Technology can teach people things that they do not even know they could do. In conclusion I believe computers have many great positive effects on people, and it also doesn't only benefit people that use this technology it benefits others in a way too. It gives everyone a chance to learn about things, and do them so I believe computers are a great thing to have in our modern world.
1221	1224	1	3	Imagine a world without computers. Where would we get all of our information from? Would we have to rely on television or magazines, where information can be changed or is not always up-to-date? Or how would we ever get any reports done for work or homework? I know many people who don't write neatly, so how would anyone read their handwriting? Basically, computers affect our lives so much in a good way that it would be chaos without them. Computers allow people to learn how to type, which can improve all-around skills such as hand-eye coordination. They let us connect with places we are not familiar with and see family members through video calls. Furthermore, they allow people to have an online education, which can help with the economy by providing flexible learning opportunities. Computers affect us in a very good way and they change our everyday lives. Some say children these days cannot type, but a recent study done at a major university showed that a significant percentage of kids older than eight already know how to type on a keyboard. Computers have such a big effect on us with so many skills that people don't acknowledge enough. Because all of those kids know how to type, they can often spell better too. I remember one time when I was in the middle of writing a report online. I got to a word I didn't know and had always had trouble spelling it. So I took my time and typed it out one letter at a time, and it was correct! This example shows that computers can affect everyone's lives, even younger kids, by providing helpful tools. The way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move. For example, when babies learn how to walk they rely on their brains to show them how it's done. This is just like how when there is a natural disaster, such as the earthquake in a remote region, we rely on our computers to show us and tell us what is going on and how something like this could happen. Computers can affect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them. Computers affect families' everyday lives by giving them access to online educations. My ten-year-old cousin told me that she was happy her mom could go back to college from home because then they could spend more time together. I know you might think that computers can make families get further apart, but they actually can bring them closer together by enabling shared activities and communication. There is only one choice and that is that computers affect all of us in a good way. They can help us learn how to type, connect us with our world, and bring families closer together. Without computers we wouldn't be the same as we are today, and our modern society would function far less efficiently.
1222	1225	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think we should keep improving technology on computers. Some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside. I personally think that the computer is important, as long as people don't use it non-stop. There are many reasons why the computer is important. First of all, there are many places in the world that not everyone can go to. The internet is a good way to find out about a place, its culture, and its history from the comfort of your home. Also, if you are going on vacation and you would like to know a little about the vacation spot, you can just look it up on the computer to find attractions and hotels. Another reason is the computer can help you study a place too for a school project. Also, if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer for accuracy and depth. If you are disagreeing with someone then you can find quick and easy information to support your view. All you do is look up something and you can find it in seconds. And you can learn new things that you have no clue about, expanding your knowledge. Most of the time the internet is very helpful for these tasks. One more reason is communication. On the computer there are many ways you can communicate with other people, such as through email and instant messaging. If you have friends or family far away then you can keep in touch with them without leaving your house. Also, if you are not sure about homework or something like that you can just ask a friend to find out quickly. And you can send pictures or videos to people in order to keep in touch and share experiences. Sometimes people use that feature for bad or inappropriate things, which is a concern. But you can do something about it, like using privacy settings, so you don't get those bad things. The internet can help you a lot in your everyday life. You can learn about new places, you can do research, and you can communicate with friends or family. If we keep improving technology you will be able to do a lot more than you can do now, like experiencing virtual tours of distant locations. The internet will be able to help you a lot more in your everyday life with these advancements. Now you can see that the internet can help people and it's not just keeping people inside; that is why I think we should keep improving technology for everyone's benefit.
1223	1226	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I personally believe that new technology is a great thing. That’s why I think that computers have positive effects on our society. Some of these effects include developing skills to help people for the present or future, getting a better education, and helping people to become more social. Computers can help people in so many ways; you just have to realize it. So come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use. My first reason for why I feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one has and may not realize. For example, a teenager might say while typing a paper that she really likes to write. So, she might go on the internet and start looking at different writing styles, and maybe she could become a famous journalist one day. It's all from the skills she got going online and searching for what she enjoys. Another situation could be that a man applies for a job and then the employer says he has to know how to use different software, so he could go on the computer and look for a tutorial on that specific software to learn it. A computer may help people build skills now and for their own future in this manner. My second reason for why computers can have positive effects on people is that they can help them get a better education. Any adult who hasn't gone to college and wants to can take classes online and earn their degree that way. The education is not just for adults; kids can go online and research the history of different places they live in or want to visit. The great thing about it is you can find the information fast and easy, which aids learning. Computers help people learn more and get a better education for themselves through these resources. My final reason for why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social. There are so many ways to connect with family and friends from your own home. You can send an email to someone and wait for a reply. Or now, you can even instant message somebody and talk to them like they're in the same room. There are also websites, such as Facebook, where you can get together and talk with old friends you haven't seen in years. Computers can help everyone connect with anyone from anywhere. As you can see, computers have so many positive effects on people. They can help you build social skills for now and for our future. They can also help people get a better education through online resources. Plus, it is a great way to connect with past and present friends easily. Hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people in our community and beyond.
1224	1227	1	3	In today's society many new technologies have been released. Such as the music player, cell phones, and video game consoles such as Xbox, but probably the most popular and most used is the computer. The ability to access and search for information in just a couple of clicks is remarkable. Some people are so engrossed with technology that they almost get addicted to it and use it every chance they get. Is this good for people? Is what they're doing affecting their health and physical activity? Yes, people these days are affected by the internet greatly. Certain websites can once lead to a high addiction, such as Facebook, Myspace, and YouTube. These are probably the main platforms used, even for schoolwork. In the years since Facebook launched, the addiction level has increased dramatically and so have the high-pressure levels associated with constant use! Dr. Smith, a noted expert, says this online behavior must stop; people are getting addicted and gaining weight from the lack of physical activity. As you can see, the online internet can be very useful for information and connection, but it is not something that should be used non-stop as it can affect your health and bring other dangers like eye strain and social isolation.
1225	1228	1	3	Hi! I am writing about whether computers are a bad thing for society or a good thing. I think that computers are a good thing to have around. They help us in a lot of ways and they also help us find new friends and new updates. This is going to be my first opinion. I think that computers have effects on society in a good way because people can find lots of the latest updates on the weather, society, and countries. It helps society in a good way because people don't have to look through an old newspaper, which might be outdated. All they have to do is click and there they are, reading it all and probably seeing pictures and videos of it too. This is my second reason why computers are a good effect on society: they help us in a lot of ways with meeting new people and staying in close contact with them, talking with them, and sending pictures of stuff and yourself. My last opinion for why computers are a good effect on society is that if you have a business or anything, you can sell your merchandise online, keep business plans organized on a spreadsheet, and also you can make a website for your business. After a while, lots of people will know about it and it would make a really big impact on your business, helping it to grow. That was my three opinions on why computers are a good effect on society, and I think that computers are a really good effect on society for communication, information, and commerce.
1226	1229	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think that computers have a positive or negative affect on people's lives? Well if you think it is negative I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand-eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. First, computers teach good hand-eye coordination. While you use computers you are improving your hand-eye coordination. One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger, you move the mouse and click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. These actions train your hands and eyes to work together smoothly. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone, making the world feel much smaller and more connected. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7 to find information and complete tasks efficiently. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand-eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all. In fact the are the best bet for a better future.
1227	1230	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one? Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat online. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime, which helps them make decisions faster. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing, making life more convenient and connected.
1228	1231	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have good effects on people such as letting people talkto family or friends that live faraway. Computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world. My first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world. This helps you if you are going on vacation to foreign country you can learn where the test historical sights are and you can also learn where the best hotels are. If you have a project due on a foreign country you can search it up and it will give you all the data you need about it, like the population and popular customs. My second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live faraway. This helps you keep in touch so it doesn't seem like you don't know them any more. Computers can also let you talk to your friends that live faraway and if you want to hangout it would let you talk about which days are good for you and them, helping to maintain strong relationships over long distances. In conclusion, computers are very useful for learning and for staying connected with the people who matter to you, no matter where they are in the world.
1229	1232	1	3	Advancements in technology are very practical and have a positive effect on those fortunate enough to have a computer. First, computers help reach people to have better hand-eye coordination. @CAPS1, computers make it simple to learn new information about many things such as people and places across the globe. finally, computers allow people in different places to communicate instantly for the reasons above, computers are very helpful to people all around the world. One of the ways computers help people is through improving their hand eye coordination when a person learns to type and look at a screen at the same time. They will be able to do sample everyday asks much better. Is a person does not have good hand-eye coordination. They cannot ever make on the ones of a paper properly! This also, with focus, and people with better focus excel in school, work and their social lives. Hand-eye coordination is very important to learn and computers help to teach it to people. The @CAPS1 reason that I think computers people to learn about new things easily. I myself and through have know many proces. My now lucky I to be able to realize how, and the research is because of computers. Computers are aducating tools that open up a world of knowledge. Finally, computers handy because they allow for instant communication. One way communication in computers is my instant messaging. This is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation, but free of charge. The final and most popular way is video chat. Video chat is when the people use cameras connected to their computers and can talk to each other while seeing each other's face! All these ways of communicating with people around the world are very beneficial to many people, especially those with family or friends living in another town. Without a doubt, computers benefit people in society in many ways. They teach them hand eye coordination which is very important for simple, everyday tasks they also help people everywhere in the world learn about that they couldnt learn about with books. Last but not least, computers people are world in communicate with each other easily. In all these ways, computers help people everywhere and make daily life more efficient and connected.
1230	1233	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I hear you are whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. In my opinion, i think that, yes, they do have a positive effect on people. I think this because @NUM1. Computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. Computers are often helpful to those with special needs, and @NUM3. The computer allows you to connect win people who @MONTH1 live faraway with out having to travel to them. I really enjoy learning about foreign places and culture. I know that from my own experience that the more knoledgable you are about foreign places and culture. The more smart you become overall. Without the computer, many people would not be able to explore these places and learn about them. The computer is basically a big encyclopedia that supplys important information to those who are unable to travel across the world and visit these places. Without computers, people would be less educated about the people, cultures, and the world we live in . Places such as pyrimids in in @LOCATION1, and other wonders can be explored from your home. Don't you agree? In my school there are several students with special needs. I, personally, can't even begin to imagine how difficult it must be for them to learn. But one thing i do know is that the computer is a very helpful rescource to them. The computer supplies pictures, sounds, and interactive activities that really help kids out. Since some of the kids in my school who have special needs have a hard time reading. The computer helps by reading it aloud to mom, providing crucial support. Where would those children be if they didn't have computers? I love keeping in touch with my distent family and friends. Don't you? It used to be that it would take days and days to send and recieve a letter from relative. @MONTH1 because of the computer, hard task can be done with a simple click of the mouse. But thats not all. Besides sending virtual e-mail to people, because of the computer, you see them face to face! Some computers have webcams that allow you to see someone through the screen of your computer, isnt that great?! So, why waste money flying to see someone to deliver a simple message when you can deliver it personally in almost less than @NUM4 seconds? Becaose of the computer, people talk more and are often brought closer together. So, as you can see there are many important positive effects that computers have on people. The reasons being @NUM1. computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. @NUM2. computers are often helpful to those with special needs. And @NUM3. computers allow you to connect with people who @MONTH1 live faraway without having to travel to them. Thank you for listening to my perspective on this important subject.
1231	1234	1	3	More and more people use computers every day. Computers are a great help for projects, email, vacation spots, and so on. However, some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer instead of exercising, or taking a walk. I think that computers are an important part of a person's life because the information found on a computer is very useful. It can be useful to you when you have a report coming up. What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do, you don't have time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and get all the information I need from the internet. I would also use a computer to learn about far away places, or even famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it. Like, you could find where the best restaurant locations are, the best hotels, and even the best tourist spots. Computers are also helpful for chatting. My grandparents moved so I don't talk to them that much anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick e-mail saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! That's a lot of work to write down by hand! At some works, the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything that's going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer screen. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an incentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with. Playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax and unwind. Computers are a great help for reports, vacations, chatting, and information to help you study for a test. Also to play games on. A lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs. I think computers are an important part of a person's daily life and provide many essential services.
1232	1236	1	3	In my own opinion, computers are a great addition to our world. Computers can help people with schoolwork, communication and entertain you in a safe way. Those are the reasons why computers have positive effects on people around the world. First of all, computers help with a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world-wide-web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can't find in books. In addition if a student forgets, loses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be as neat as possible. That is hard for some students, but typing it is neat, and everyone can do it. As you can see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are a great way to communicate and keep-in-touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send something to him, he could easily e-mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, they could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up a conference, the teacher could e-mail the parent a time and date. That is why computers are great for easy communication. Lastly, computers provide a safe, fun way of entertainment. Many companies make kid-friendly websites that children can go on. For instance, my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way. Studies show that a high percentage of kindergartners who go on these websites, do better in first grade compared to those who don't; computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide easy communication, and provide safe educational activities, as you can see, computers are a great addition to our world and its development.
1233	1237	1	3	Dear Editor, Some people think that computers are used too much, and are helping people become over weight, and even obese. This is maybe true, but computers also teach hand eye coordination, give people the opportunity to learn about far away places, and people can even communicate on them! Over all I think computers effect people in a positive way, and these are some reasons why. Computers help teach hand eye coordination. I know your probably thinking “huh? How do computers do that? All your doing is staring at a screen.” But to your dismay computers do teach hand eye coordination. It does this because while playing games, people watch the screen, and click with their hands. They don’t just stare at the mouse while they play these games. By doing so, it teaches hand eye coordination. Scientist have proven that people who own a computer and use it at least a few hours a week, have better coordination that people who don’t own a computer by a significant percentage! Just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words. Hand-eye coordination is a real thing. It helps you play better in sports like baseball, and not only that but it helps future jobs. As you can tell, without computers our hand eye coordination would suffer. People think that computers are only used for games, but in reality, they teach us many things about the world. Without computers people would know about nearly anything that’s going in other countries. For example, the other day, my mom was checking her email and came across the story of a young, starving child. That story changed her everyday life because she takes food for granted. Without a computer my mom would have known less about life in other countries. Because we live in a fortunate nation, we need to know what’s going on in other countries. Others are less fortunate, but computers help remind and teach us what’s going in the world everyday. One of the main advantages about computers is they allow people to communicate through them. Even my grandmother said that, without computers, I wouldn’t be as close to you as I am today. My grandmother and I use the website skype.com. This website allows you to not only talk to the other person, but to see them too! Because of sites like these, I’m allowed to stay in contact, and be able to see my grandmother who lives far away. Without computers this wouldn’t be possible. Not only do computers let you talk to people far away, but people close too. I often find myself asking friends over the computer, what the homework is, or when the next test is, etc. Computers make it easier to connect to people near and far. In conclusion, computers help in all different ways. The world would be upside down without them. They give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, teach hand eye coordination, and allow people to communicate with each other. Computers have some flaws, but they also have so many positive effects too that I think they shine over all the tiny flaws. Thank you for considering my viewpoint.
1234	1238	1	3	Dear our local newspaper, Computers have a huge effect on people in a negative way. It could change our lifestyle dramatically. For example, people who sit there all day on the computers spend less of their time exercising, enjoying nature and socializing with friends and families. Therefore, computers affect us greatly. One of the reasons why computers are horrible, is because people spend too much time on their computer and don't exercise. It's always important to stay fit and healthy. This could be why a large percentage of people who live in the country is obese. This could be a leading cause of obesity. I can connect to this because I had a relative, who admitted that he gained at least five pounds for being on the computer constantly; not exercising could lead to this. Is it really worth sitting in front of the computer all day eating? There are better entertainment activities that are active and will keep us healthy and exercising. Another reason, is that it seems people are far more involved in technology, which affects you greatly. This will not improve your social abilities. You could lose self confidence in yourself and not be as open or outgoing. No one likes to be a loner. The feeling could be devastating. This would make it very difficult to interact and make new friends. It's always a pleasure to know that you have so many loving people around you. You could lose them with a snap of your fingers by spending more time focused on the computer, rather than your friends and family. Lastly, it could be bad to get through life without your friends and family. In conclusion, people who spend too much time on their computer spend less of their time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with friends and families. The computers are liked so much that they matter the most in life, leading to being more focused on them. Computer affect us in a negative way that can change the course of our life for the worse.
1235	1239	1	3	"Dear editor of the Local Gazette, Our society is being ruined, ruined by computers of course. They are so time consuming that I am afraid they are causing more people to be obese in our community. People are afraid that they are limiting themselves from interacting face to face, and spending time enjoying nature. I feel the exact same way and someone should put a stop to this! An average american goes on a computer for about several hours a day. With going to work or school, and sleeping, that way leaves a little time to go out and explore nature. Our national parks have been decreasing in their numbers of customers at a fast rate. I visited Yellowstone last week to find out if as many people have been going. The man who works at the entrance was saying that ""since the start of last year alone about twenty percent less people have been to the park,"" I believe that the reason for that is because of computers. They limit people from going to parks or to zoos, by consuming the public time with all of the ""new fashion"" or the newest game on miniclip.com. Also, I believe that the public is spending so much time on computers that they are not able to go out and exercise. With the newest ""sims game,"" how are kids supposed to stay fit and healthy? I did a study on how many hours kids spend on their computer and out of the people who said more than sixty minutes, a majority of them could legally considered obese. Is that how we want our next generation to be our next president and lawyers, and doctors? No, we want them to live life to the fullest by taking care of themselves by exercising. Computers are getting kids so consumed that is not ok. Lastly, with computers, families and friends don't really talk to each another face to face, or interact with each other at all. I mean sure, parents come home to their child on the computer and give them a kiss on the head. But is that enough? I do not believe it is. I asked a friend of mine's child about how much he interacts with his family and friends face to face. He said that well since he got his new ""gaming computer with a large gig hard drive"", he hadn't been talking to them a whole lot. However, everyday he went on ""chat for a good two hours"", to talk to his friends. And only occasionally would he get an e-mail or two from his family asking how his day was. I do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life. That is what our town has come down to because of computers. They limit you from interacting with friends and family, give you less time to exercise and limit you from going out and exploring nature. Who knows, maybe at this time in a few years, our community will be run by computer. Do we want that? No, so lets put a stop to it now. Thank you very much for your time."
1236	1240	1	3	Dear editor, I believe that computers are a great and fun tool. But I also believe people can spend too much time on them. The computer is excellent for productivity. People can use them to type papers or reports, create detailed graphs, and accomplish other important tasks for us. Schools are integrating computers more and more now. Schools have websites for students to visit to find out their homework assignments, classwork, projects, reports, and extra credit opportunities. The school has even started doing something very new, allowing parents and kids to check the student's grades online. Not only do the schools help students, but everyday people benefit as well. If a student has a project but doesn't know how to start it, then he or she can google their project topic and find ways to begin. Computers can be really great and easy to use as you can see, especially for schoolwork. Computers are not only great for academic purposes, but also for leisure purposes. Before computers and the internet, there were only a few ways to have fun during boring times in the day. One was watching TV, reading a book, or going outside, if you could. What do I mean by that last sentence? If you lived in a city, then it would be harder to go outside because maybe you lived in an apartment or somewhere not in a community with a yard. Then you couldn't go out easily; and reading books can become boring after a while, and maybe there was nothing on TV for you to watch. But when computers and the internet came out, people could play games, watch videos, and talk to cousins or family who live far away. Computers are also good for social networks. Not all families live close, but they can still be a close family. But in this economy we can't always afford to visit them whenever we want. So by using computers we can contact them, facebook them, myspace them, and even video chat with them, which as I said is great for far away family. But at times people can become too obsessed with them. Some people spend all day on one website, particularly Facebook or YouTube. Do not get me wrong, these websites are fun and cool. But not cool enough to never go outside and have free, natural fun. I remember I logged into Facebook and saw a girl on, I logged off around an hour later and she was still on, then I logged in again around midnight and the same girl was on! That is just too long to be on one website. Computers are a great tool for humans to use for business, education, and leisure. But too much of anything is not good, and moderation is key to a healthy life.
1237	1241	1	3	Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well, this article gives you information about all of this. First, a lot of people don't like computers because they say they're too confusing. Actually, computers aren't that hard to work with; you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to them. Also, computers can make things easier like typing. Why should you write by hand when you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster and more neatly than you could on normal paper? Secondly, the internet is very easy to use and often more convenient than books. All you have to do is go to Google or any other search engine, type what you're looking for in, and in a split second you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also, if you're planning a vacation the internet can help immensely. You can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts available on the web. Also, you can book hotels and look at live pictures with more detail than a simple brochure. So when you book a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase almost anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts and sales. I remember the time when I bought a pair of shoes online and saved a lot of money. Also, it usually ships to your house in a couple of days, which is very convenient. Lastly, going on it a lot isn't necessarily bad. I go on the computer almost every day but I also go outside too. I can do this because at night when no one can go outside I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What if your mom or dad went on a business trip for a few weeks? You could use your webcam and talk to them and see them as if you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so, especially when it is that helpful and easy to work with.
1238	1242	1	3	Dear newspaper company, More and more people use computers each day. But not everyone agrees it benefits society. Some people say the people that are on computers don't get exercise or play outside. Then when they get off the computer their eyes hurt and they can't see as well. But with all that said, I believe the benefits of computers are very well used. The reasons why I agree that computers have benefits is that they give you hand-eye coordination and provide people with information on faraway places. They can also be used to rent hotels, movies, and games. You can even talk to people online from around the world! What if we didn't have computers though? What if a serious crime happened then we wouldn't be able to find the criminal's name or his records quickly! Some bad reasons for having computers is a big issue right now: cyberbullying! Kids might get picked on and they will be hurt. People get called names all the time online. Another big problem is that people online seem friendly and then they try to do harmful things. There are two other big problems with computers; one is called plagiarism. Plagiarism is when you take someone's work and put your name on it. It can also be when you steal something and say it's yours. The second problem is stealing music by getting it for free, by downloading from the internet using services like LimeWire. Then the artists don't get the money from the album sales. That is why I agree that computers give you benefits, but they give you bad ones too, so you must be careful when you're on a computer.
1239	1243	1	3	Dear all computer lovers, I do think you are all spending too much time on the computer. Yes, it is good to go on the computer and learn new facts, watch funny videos, and basically everything is on the computer these days. But most people spend too much time on the computer. You need to be doing three things: enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends, and most importantly, exercising. In this letter I will be explaining why you need these things, which you can't get on the computer. First, I will be explaining why it is important to enjoy nature. Sometimes, enjoying nature can be difficult but if we all look closer it can be really fun. Some examples of nature are trees, grass, and the fresh air. But I am sure all of my fellow teenagers would agree that that sounds very boring; we would all rather sit and watch TV. Some examples of making nature fun is instead of looking at a boring tree, you can climb the tree, or you can go outside and play with your dog and lay in the grass. One example of my favorite things to do in nature is when I stay up all night I run outside very early and lay in the grass, breathe in the fresh air and watch the sun come up. Secondly, and every bit as important, is that you get off the computer and spend time with family and friends. Family can do many things with you and I know that I am very happy when I am with family because they always make me laugh and most importantly my family loves to party. Parties are always fun especially when you are with family. Friends are also great to be with because they make you laugh, have adventures with you, and are always there for you when you need them. So please, remember to balance your screen time with these vital real-world experiences.
1240	1244	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a negative thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what people are doing on the computer. The first thing is that computers are having a bad effect on people and their lives; computers are making people just sit inside on their computers all day and do nothing productive. They just sit there playing games; also about a large percentage of the people who are spending too much time on the computer are probably eating while they're on the computer which is why some people can become fat. Most of the people who spend all of their time on the computer are people in their teens and twenties, some are in their thirties or forties. Just sitting there on the computer will get you nowhere in life. It will not give you a job or a school education. By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things outside. If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. Being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college; kids who are on the computer too much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends, get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more than four or five hours; the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and spend the rest of their time doing something else. Well, all of the kids from kindergarten through fifth grade should go out and play with their toys, and people in sixth grade and up should hang out with friends and do things like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also everyone in these grades should interact with their families more by seeing them more than a few times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers, which is like I sometimes go on Facebook. Other people go on Facebook, Google, games, looking up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is YouTube to listen to music and watch videos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people should be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and probably will get too fat. So the effect of computers on people is ultimately negative.
1241	1245	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard over @CAPS2 @NUM1 @CAPS3 that people believe computers have different effects on people. In the past, computers have caused problems with the human body. Many @CAPS5 are becoming too dependent on computers. So in my opinion, I believe computers have a negative effect. First of all, computers have caused @CAPS5 to not exercise and become unhealthy. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS5 have said they are spending too much time on the computer. @CAPS5 need to realize that sitting on a computer @CAPS4 is a danger to their health; you don't want your @CAPS5 to have eye problems in the future, do you? It is fine to be on the computer for work, but for playing games I realize I need to stop and go out and exercise to keep well-balanced health. @PERSON1 says, ""As @CAPS4 technology increases, the more and more people we have given glasses to."" @CAPS5 need to make changes to what they do during the day. So @CAPS4 I am against computers because @CAPS5 are becoming unhealthy. My next point is that people do not spend @CAPS4 much time with family and friends. In the past my mom used to yell at me for being on the computer too much. @PERCENT1 of people believe family time is very important, did you know that? Computers could even lead to divorce from overuse. People need to interact within families because computer use decreases interaction. My last reason is that people are not enjoying nature. @NUM4 out of @NUM3 people are not enjoying nature, which gives you a chance to express your thoughts. Many people need time to think about what is happening in their life and they cannot do this on the internet. In the past I felt stressed because I never had a moment to just relax and think about things without a computer, always doing something or homework. @PERCENT2 of people who have too much going on in life believe that they need this time. Do you now see that nature can be helpful? So @CAPS4 you can see computers have a negative effect because people don't get enough time to enjoy nature. In conclusion, I believe computers have a huge negative effect on people. The reasons why are people would be less active, people will not interact @CAPS4 well, and people do not enjoy nature. So I strongly urge you to vote for computers having a negative effect."
1242	1246	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, @CAPS1 my name is @PERSON1. I go to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1. I'm in @NUM1 grade. I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on technology; I believe that technology has a positive effect on people. My opinion is that computers are good. Keep reading to learn how they change people's lives in @NUM2 @LOCATION1. My first reason is computers teach you hand-eye coordination. For example, when I was in @NUM3 grade I would go to the library in my @ORGANIZATION1. They had a website named @CAPS3 to learn. It was designed to help you learn how to type without looking at the keyboard. My second reason is computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, when I was in @NUM4 grade in @CAPS4 @CAPS5, I had to write a report about @CAPS6. And I went on @ORGANIZATION2. I found wonderful pictures of @CAPS7 and I saw how they live. I watched a @CAPS8 special like @NUM5 weeks ago; it said @PERCENT1 of people would use @ORGANIZATION2 to look up people's numbers and more personal things. My third reason is computers give people the ability to communicate with others. For example, when I want to talk to my cousin that lives in @LOCATION3, I go on the internet and talk to them on webcam. I could talk to them easily. I read in an article like a month ago that @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to chat with people. In conclusion, some people might say some experts are concerned people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising or enjoying friends and family. However, being on the computer is way safer than going outside. More kids or people would be safe. Next, you should post this out on your newspaper.
1243	1247	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and they benefit us greatly. Let's say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, etc. looks like, I could just go onto a computer, open or download a program, and there it is. Computers also help people express their creativity through a program that allows you to draw or build. I bet they even help young children become smarter by building things on the computer. Another thing computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad economy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can help keep people alive and breathing; you can find broken bones or tumors, you can build bridges and homes by making blueprints. The last thing computers help us do is the most important and that is they help people learn. By making simulations of the Titanic, a spaceship, or the ocean floor, they help find information. Even if it's about people, you can see people on a computer with a camera, or save a life by finding where they crashed in their plane. That's why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advanced and smarter.
1244	1248	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. You can do lots of stuff with computers such as help people learn new things about almost everything. Also, there are some programs on the computer that allow you to talk to other people. Also, for adults, they can take care of some finances and bills online and some taxes. I think computers definitely have a positive effect on people. A lot of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people. Nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new. Also, kids in school use computers all the time for school work and to learn about new things. Kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world. Computers definitely have a positive effect on people when they learn new things. Another great thing about computers is that there are programs that allow you to talk to other people. Eight out of ten people talk to another person almost every day on the computer. This is a good thing because they’re able to talk to friends and family from a long distance and enjoy themselves. It is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer. Another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also. Seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer. This is a good thing because adults used to have to do it by hand, now they can just do it on the computer, which is definitely a positive effect on a person! I think computers definitely have a positive effect on people in many ways. They help people learn new stuff about things. Also, they allow you to talk to friends and family over the internet. And finally, they allow you to do finances and pay the bills online instead of by hand. There are many ways still that computers have a positive effect on people, I’ve only stated just a few of them. I hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive effect on people.
1245	1249	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you keep in touch and @CAPS1 do computers affect your job? Some people are using computers too often and aren't able to enjoy the outside world. Some use computers for other things and sometimes just waste time. I believe that computers have a strong positive effect on people. You can keep in touch, you can learn, and you can have fun with computers. Computers have a big role in our society, and I know you'll make the right decision on whether or not computers are used too much. You can keep in touch. Not only can you keep in touch with relatives, but also people in different countries, or states, and even people like your friends who live next door. E-mail is a great and healthy way to communicate with others. There are also other websites like Facebook and Skype where you can actually post pictures up about yourself and family and be protected. @CAPS3 if you live miles and miles away you can easily show your friends the things you've been doing or your new baby boy. @CAPS4 also shows things about your personal info. You can make friends with people and plan when @CAPS1 you're going to hang out this weekend. Yesterday my @CAPS2 emailed me a picture of a cub bear in a tree outside of his cabin he was playing in. He's over @NUM1 hours away and I can still email him back saying, ""@CAPS2, did you make a friend?"" Within seconds he can respond saying, ""I even got a bear hug =)!"" @CAPS3 I talk to him while he's away and we're almost together. I bet you use email as much as we do to save on printers. @CAPS4's a fast and easy way to communicate. You can learn. Computers are a very big part in the learning experience. Teachers, students, parents, and grandparents learn everyday with computers. There are educational websites to learn about things. In our school yesterday we used ""quiz.com."" @CAPS4's a website for schools where you can take a quiz instead of using paper. If you're a busy parent with kids, you can work online. You can get paid for the work you do with websites. You can also go to school online. There are people who are very busy and don't have time to go to college classes; they can take classes online. They can learn and even interact with others. The computers teach you; they don't hurt you. Everything involves computers: security, jobs, bills, school, contacting, games, everything. Most people and schools couldn't run their businesses without a computer. Computers protect you and help you grow. You can have fun with computers. A lot of people go online and play games on numerous websites. These games can pass time and give the player some fun. @CAPS4 might not be running, but it's fun. You can do @CAPS3 many things on the computer to have fun. You can play online games, download music, Skype, browse, shop, and even meet people. Meeting people is a big thing. A lot of people these days are using this way to meet and interact with new and interesting people. My cousin is now @NUM2 and he used online dating and met this really sweet and pretty girl that lived nearby. @NUM3 years later they're married and are more in love than imagined. See, @CAPS3 love can be found on computers and a lot of fun too. You have read my reasons and you have realized what the computer does for the world. Most everyone owns a computer and almost everyone needs one. This is an easy way to communicate or keep in touch, you can learn from it, and you can have fun with the computer. There are many more things that are in good use. I have now convinced you that computers are very positive for people."
1246	1250	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 @CAPS1 after @CAPS1. Oh, how much you want to just relax in the natural free air, but with all the advances in technology you feel it's your job to always be updated. I believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people. People aren't exercising, interacting with family and friends in person, or having the ability to enjoy nature. Exercising means getting your heart to pound, your body to sweat and move because of endorphins that ultimately make you feel better. @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all @CAPS1 does not support you with the natural urge to exercise. People who support advances in technology say, ""@CAPS3 are able to teach you hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4, coordination is important but your body as a whole should also be put into account as well. @PERSON1, voted #@NUM1 cardiologist in world says, ""more and more people are suffering from heart disease & attacks every year!"" He goes on to say, ""many links have been theorized to this ongoing problem, but none seem to add up as well as my theory. I believe peoples lives have been overcome by technology. More and more cases have pointed to the people being addicted to their computers. Its unbelieveable but, @CAPS5 individuals have a @PERCENT2 higher chance of developing heart disease!! There are many healthier things you can absorb yourself in. Like tennis for example. In tennis you have to develop hand-eye coordination in order to hit the ball correctly. Tennis also increases your heart rate & burns fat cells, to help you lose weight. Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis has actually made them more confident. This is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and live healthier, they feel they can conquer the world. Isn't this the attitude everyone needs? Nature is all over and helps us even if @CAPS4 don't notice. Like trees, they take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Oxygen is key to life. Trees also are home to many living organisms. Like the samuel woodpecker or even an owl. They all rely on trees to survive. But, if you are on the @CAPS3 @NUM5 hours a @CAPS1 @DATE1 you @MONTH1 not realize the nature and its beauty. Nature is a beautiful thing that over @PERCENT3 of people say they enjoy relaxing outside, listening to birds singing morning songs or a deer minding their own business feeding with their young watching. But, advances in technology also ruin this fine balance of nature. Technology needs a power source, google, for example states to the press that, ""our business surely enjoys nature but needs to also run their corporation"". They go on to say, ""we get our energy from oil and coal"". @CAPS5 according, to scientists like them say that, oil is a primary source for big corporations. It is efficient but they don't keep in mind the fact that over a million trees are lost each year because of pollution. And that depletes the protection we get from our ozone layer, speeding the development of climate change. ""Without advances in technology we @MONTH1 have a better and safer earth for generations to come."" Oh sure, says sue sarcastically. But since you are texting her you don't know what she means and ask out her tone. If not for advances in technology people could make the right decisions. @PERCENT4 of texters say they have miss interpreted others texts. this means bad decisions all across the world. @PERCENT1 also say they have participated in some form of sexting like there sending pictures, a dangerous language. Underage children are participating in illegal activity because of advances in technology. The chief crimes head of the police department in @ORGANIZATION1 says that ever since the invention of the cell phone with the ability to send pictures & text he has seen @NUM6 more cases on child pornography. @PERCENT5 of @CAPS5 people are under the age of consent. Without the advances of technology for cellphones this wouldn't even be possible for minors. Advances in cellular device has also kept families farther & farther apart. @PERCENT6 of parents say that their children have had less appreciation and love that they had before they recieved cell phones. And @PERCENT1 of kids who have cell phones say they don't think they need their family interaction anymore. Do you believe this is the message to be sent to future generations? I thank you for reading this article and I hope you are now experiencing the other side of the debate. Children need to interact with their families more, enjoy nature and start exercising. This is impossible to do with the advances of technology."
1247	1251	1	3	There are all kinds of computers, but they all do the same thing. Computers help people with anything they need. Such as, you can go online and chat with people, you can buy and sell things, you can go to college, you can learn anything, and it helps you type up your homework neatly. I personally think that computers are very helpful and we are lucky to have them. Going online can give you so many opportunities for anything. From going to college online when you don't have the time to go in person to just talking to your friends. You can learn just about anything on the computer and it's just so much fun. The computer to most people I know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones. Going to college online is so easy. There isn't alot to it. Alot of people in the country enroll online for college. For instance, parents that want to go back but can't go in person or someone who has alot of work but cant fit in the time to actually go to college. But they can go online and take classes on their free time. Also, talking to friends online is fun too. When you arent at a friends house you can chat with them online. Maybe you can go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 or even your email. There are many ways to do it on that fabulous computer. The computer is also jam-packed with loads of information that is helpful to anyone in the world. You can learn about different countries, people, or even the recipe of apple pie. Who knows what you can learn. The computer has things for every person in the world. Since we are all different. Some of us like to buy or sell things on the computer or do our homework. Maybe even just a fun computer game is nice. Every person in the world is different, but we have one thing in common. The world knows we need computers and computers are the smartest thing since the calculator. Buying and selling things on the computer is easier than it looks. All you have to do is put what you want to sell online or look online for what you want to buy. Then you buy it or sell it. There is more to the process like the @ORGANIZATION1 people bring or take it to or away from you. But that is just the basics. You can also do your homework neatly on the computer if you have a messy handwriting. Therefore, the computer has so many things that can benefit you and the world with everything it has to offer, making our lives more convenient and connected.
1248	1252	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1. My name is @PERSON1. I have written in response to the letter sent to me on the topic of electronics. Computers, to be precise. To me, computers are helpful, yet extremely vile. These chunks of metal are expensive, unhealthy and degrading human learning capabilities. Computers have too many negative features for me to cope with. Dell, @ORGANIZATION1, and so many other computer companies sell computers at ridiculously expensive prices. You buy one on sale and when you need your computer, @CAPS2!, malfunctions and problems assail you. Now you have to call a repair man who will charge you even more money! Did you really spend your hard earned cash on a faulty hunk of trash? This is ridiculous. I went onto my computer yesterday and what do you think happened? It crashed! My six hundred dollar computer crashed! Computers are too expensive to have to keep fixing. When I get rid of mine, I'm not getting another. Have you ever sat at your computer so long your eyes watered? Horrible to endure, that's not the only problem your computer can cause. Your health is at stake! When you sit at your computer working or playing instead of going out for a jog or exercise, your health degrades. Gaining weight, pink eye from staring at the screen, do I have to go on!? The very computer you @MONTH1 love can harm you. I say, get rid of that computer. Visit friends, family and acquaintances. Be active and stay healthy. Not for me, but for you. The next point I am about to say @MONTH1 shock, surprise, or scare you. Your computer is making you stupid. I can't say it nicely. Don't call me rude because it's true. I'll give you an example. A student receives a classic homework assignment. Define these three or four words. Easy right? Wrong, I'm afraid @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids surveyed go home and use computers to retrieve the answers to homework. What if your child is cheating? What will happen to them? They could drop out of school early and live their lives as people who can't learn for themselves. Is that the world we want for kids? No! We should destroy the computers before they destroy our minds and our future. Thank you for reading my paper. It was a pleasure as always to write to you. Have a nice day.
1249	1253	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers are bad because you will be wanting to do no homework because people are playing too much on computers and they are getting addictive to the computers and it is dangerous because you might be talking to people that you don't know on the computer and it is the very danger because it is the same thing as having a myspace on the computer it is very dangerous because there are bad people that be going on the computer and people be posting bad stuff on the computer that can lead to harmful situations for young people who are not aware of the risks involved with sharing information online without proper caution and supervision from adults.
1250	1254	1	3	I do not agree that computers benefits society. There are three big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and arent spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people arent getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family is on the computer, they miss out from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat and drink bad stuff all day. People would gain weight might even get diabetes from the weight gain. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weight gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten too used to all the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk, or talk, with friends. People should at least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having too much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. So this is why I think this is bad for the societys benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart and consider limiting computer use for a healthier lifestyle. Thank you!
1251	1255	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non-active activity, so if you do use it you get no exercise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabetes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer. Can you see how computers can affect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of her new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develop speech problems. My neighbor, who I have never talked to, never really came out of his house; he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one came over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could hear the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develop relationship problems from not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and its beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer, so I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad. That is why computers have a negative effect on our society.
1252	1256	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 the world has changed so much, for the better. Technology has become so advanced, there are new cures for different diseases. Computers are one of these great benefits. They let you communicate quicker. You can keep up with family members and old friends. You can also talk to different people who live in another state, country, or continent. There is a quote that says ""communication is key."" I'll put that into more details in my next paragraph. I remember one time long ago, the only way to communicate was by letters or you would have to walk. Now with computers, with just one email or an instant message, someone can get your message instantly. By sending a letter it can take a while. Even if you call someone they @MONTH1 not be home or answer. But you can get emails and instant messages any time. It also doesn't cost to send long distance, which will bring me to my next topic. A professor at @ORGANIZATION2 once said ""Computers are taking time."" But, if you think about it, what they're actually doing is reconnecting you with family members and old friends. For example, you @MONTH1 move and not be able to see them again. Then, you get a new phone number and forget other people's numbers. If you have a computer you can go on a great social networking site where you look up some old friends' names and distant relatives and you find out that it's really them. Then they introduce you to other family members and before you know it you are all talking to each other again. Now, I'll bring to you my @DATE1 topic. The world wide web is a big place where people from all over the world connect. On the world wide web you can meet some new people who do not live in your state, or country. But, you find that you are starting to click; when you meet this person they @MONTH1 be of a different race. That's ok, you can learn new things about a different culture. While you two @MONTH1 have something in common, you can share other things you like to do which you can try, so you're learning something new while having fun at the same time. Now you'll see it's time you get a computer rather than never have the experience. With a computer you can communicate quicker, reconnect with distant relatives and old friends, and you can also talk to different people who are like you."
1253	1257	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you don't even need a keyboard. Having computers benefits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. Well computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the viruses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certain letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parkour. Parkour is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parkour tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They too might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a business that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But either way they are using computers in a way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more. If you were to ask ten random people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to businesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for businesses using those internet communications you can communicate to people if you're going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning, communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us succeed is great.
1254	1258	1	3	Dear readers, On the current debate of the effects of computers, I believe they strongly benefit all people. For example on some computers a business software can be incorporated, allowing a meeting to be held over the computers. Not only is it convenient, but this saves money. Also, computers come with built in programs that can help keep track of your expenses. These are simple and save lots of time. Plus, computers also help you stay in touch with friends. Even if they are @NUM1 miles away you can click a button and have a live video chat! First off, the business software on new computers are out of this world. You can make a brochure of sales and expenses, all with an easy stroke on the mouse. This is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer you and all your clients can hold a conference call. Doing this allows you to relax and multitask while your computer is feeding you coverage of the call in crystal-clear sound. Normally a phone would have to be glued to your ear but now you are hands free. Another time where computers are handy is at tax time. Tired of running around your house to find your car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1, taxes can be calculated in along with their name, so when you take the taxes to a tax consultant, everything is organized. Using these tools cuts down on stress and leaves you less frustrated. And even better, you can buy a tax program for your computer, so you never have to leave your couch! Think about it, paying somebody to count your taxes year after year, when you can save a fortune and do it yourself. Above all, computers help you connect with old friends who have moved away or parted ways earlier in life. Now, the internet contains many social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 where you can reunite with lost pals. These networks also offer access to photo-sharing and chat, so everybody can see how your family is and vice versa. Along with this is video chatting, where you can have a face to face conversation with somebody even on the other side of the world. This is totally private, so it isn't dangerous to say names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an amazing tool! To conclude, the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives. Not only can we see who won the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also has interactive business software as well. Never again will work be so difficult. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you on top of your game. Finally, it is also helpful for all the tools that can be used to interact with friends thousands of miles away. I believe the computer is critical for success and happiness in life. It's a new age, let's adapt to it.
1255	1259	1	3	To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 your life without a laptop or a desktop computer. It would be hectic right? How will you keep up with your email or type up the articles for this very newspaper? Even though some people @MONTH1 believe that computers are taking away from exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends, computers do have a positive effect on us. The list of reasons why is endless but three that stand out are you can communicate with people in other states or countries, it's more interesting to learn from a website than a textbook, and eventually @CAPS2 will be computerized anyway. Am I right? Have your old teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country? If yes, didn't you have to write letters? Then, you had to wait at least @NUM1 weeks before your pen pal wrote back. If you had used computers, you would've gotten a response back within days. I know many parents and other adults @MONTH1 think that e-mails are a waste of energy but actually they're faster than letters will ever be. Has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring? Yes? No? That's where computers come in. It's much more interesting to use the internet than reading from a book. I understand that some students can read from a book and retain all of the facts that they've learned from that one book but various students learn differently than that. If a student learns from the internet, they're more likely to remember it because they won't be put to sleep by the boredom of a textbook. Many people have mentioned and some statistics show that by at least @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be computerized. Do you seriously want to be the last one left behind? I wouldn't. I understand that you are a person who likes to keep up with the current events so why not use your computer more often? When they say @CAPS2, they mean @CAPS2. They even have @CAPS3 tools on the computer. So I want you to take a survey of how many people find computers effective and you'll be surprised. Many people will say the same that I've said. The choice is yours, which side are you on? Thank you for considering my perspective.
1256	1260	1	3	Dear local newspaper, My name is John Smith, a student in the fifth grade at Oakwood Elementary School in Springfield. I'm writing to you because I heard that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In my opinion, I think it benefits society. If you keep reading I will tell you why it benefits society. My first reason is that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, when I see my older brother go on the computer he looks much smarter on it. That is because two out of five members of my family learn things from the computer. My second reason is that it teaches hand-eye coordination. For example, when I play games on the computer my hands are the ones doing everything for me. Another example is that when I watch the game my hands are reacting quickly. About four out of five humans play games on the computer and let their hands do everything. My third reason is that it gives people the ability to learn. For example, when I was using the computer it used to teach me so much that I go on most of the time. Many students study on computers and they learn about things that they never knew. Also they have the ability to learn more on the computer. Someone might say people are spending too much time on their computer. However, I believe that computers help people learn about things that happen in the world. For example, they could learn about the war that is going on and how people are risking their lives for this cause. In conclusion, in my opinion it benefits society. Computers have a positive effect, they teach hand-eye coordination, and they give people the ability to learn. I think you should put all your support in this important matter.
1257	1261	1	3	Have you ever had someone move away and you wanted to keep in touch? Well having a computer allows this to happen. Furthermore, it gives students the ability to learn about different places, people and much more. But why do some people not hire them? First, computers allow you to talk online with friends and family. For example, using email, social media, and video chat. For instance, I have a friend who moved away and now we email back and forth to keep in touch. Social media allows people to chat instantly and upload pictures and videos. For example, my aunt shares pictures of my baby cousins so people can see how they're growing up. Lastly, some businesses use a webcam to talk to other people. Say the boss is on a business trip to see how his employees were doing without him; he could hook up a web cam and have a conversation with them. That is how computers allow people to communicate. Secondly, computers allow people to learn about things. For example, if a student had to research a topic they could type the topic into a website like Bing or Google and they could find all the answers they needed to help them with their project. Also, if a family wanted to go on a trip they could search for it and find a hotel and sites they might want to see. That is how computer allows people to find information. Thirdly, they help pay taxes. For example, TurboTax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and it remembers every tax you have paid. So if some company sends you a notice saying you haven't paid a bill you can go on TurboTax and check. So reader these are some ways why people should enjoy computers. They allow people to talk to friends and family by email, social media, and by webcam. They also give people the ability to learn information about faraway places and people. Lastly, what is so bad about having a computer? They allow people to pay taxes online and to type papers. Computers are needed in this day and age or else some people would not be able to survive without them. So reader these are some reasons why people should easily use computers.
1258	1262	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three reasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, there are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can find a surgery because they're so fat. They think there is a cure for obesity on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure there is by doing some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if they're not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who they even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good for people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem there is that they don't get enough exercise and are not paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to therapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get an education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure.
1259	1263	1	3	Dear School Board, I think that more people should start using computers. They can offer things that just writing things down on a piece of paper can't, like being able to learn about things that aren't taught in school, you can talk with friends online and you can keep everything in one place. The first reason I think more people should use computers is that they can learn about things that aren't taught in school. Such as current events, the history of our nation and how our government works. Now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on television or a newspaper. But the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video. Also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on television. Another reason I think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet. This is great because there may be people you haven't seen in awhile because they moved. I had a friend who moved to Pittsburgh when I was eight and when I got a social media account I was able to find him and talk with him a while before him visiting. Or you can just keep in touch with friends that go to a different school. The last reason I think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures, videos, documents and contacts on your hard drive. This is important to because I am not very well organized when it comes to school. But I started using my laptop and started to do some of the work on the computer. This helped me be less cluttered and keep all my work in one place. It also means you can email that work to a teacher or send notes to a friend who might have missed school that day. So in conclusion those are why I think we should have people use computers more. They can help you learn, let you talk with friends, or let you keep everything in one place. That is why I think more people should use computers.
1260	1264	1	3	Dear City Council, Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Thanks to computers people aren't being active as much, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. One reason this is true is because people are not exercising, they're too busy playing on the computers. People are gaining weight, which is already a problem in the United States because of unnecessary technology. There are plenty of sports that could be done, such as soccer, baseball, football, and so many more. People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them. Another reason computers don't have a positive effect on people is because they don't go out and enjoy nature. People spend too much time looking up beautiful places and animals when they could easily go explore around outside! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park, even by the beach and you'll see loads of animals. Not to mention, the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home! Without computers, people could quickly start enjoying nature more often. Thirdly, a reason why computers aren't positive on people is because they're not interacting with other people. Some people are too busy on Facebook or Myspace, e-mailing or texting each other. Sometimes they aren't even talking to who they believed they were; it is not only dangerous but unhealthy also. What's wrong with giving someone far away a call? You can actually hear their voice and know its them on the other line! It's ridiculous how people will e-mail a friend that's down the street. It would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house. The two of you can chat and take a walk, or play a game, not just sit in front of a screen the whole day. Computers make interacting with other people, in person, a lot more difficult. With computers people are not active enough, don't enjoy nature often, or interact with others as much. They simply are not a positive effect on people. You should also agree and let computers stay with professionals.
1261	1265	1	3	Dear editors, I was planning on taking a trip to @LOCATION1. I found directions within a second using a computer. Computers are great, people friendly pieces of equipment, but as technology evolves, people are beginning to rely on their computers for entertainment. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, but there are many outdoor activities that are more healthy then sitting around on the computer all day such as socializing, the great-outdoors, and other on sports. Familiar with @CAPS1 is a great program for socializing but there are many stronger dangers. Did you know that anybody can view your profile which contains personal info? You don't always have to chat online. Call up a friend and hang out at maybe a local movie theatre. Many people, and I agree, think seeing a movie with their pals is alot more entertaining then playing online chess or any other virtual game with a friend a fan of movies? No problem! go on a walk or a bike ride or walk your dog while riding a bike! There are so many. @ORGANIZATION1 park. What an amazing place to spend your vacation camp outs at @TIME1, bikes during the day, its a wonderful part of nature and the best part of you a park anywhere in the world! Camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends. Hiking is a popular part of a parks and can be performed by all ages, so go out and spend a weekend in the great outdoors! Not looking at a computer screen. Soccer, baseball, basketball and lacrosse. These are just come of the many fun sports. Out there, and yes, they are certainly fun and healthy. Every town I know about has sport fields where many kids and adults of all ages use. it also a great way to make friends! Get to know them in person and not over the internet. Daily exercise while having fun beats just having fun on a computer. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this article and go out and meet new friends. Visit a local park or play a sport for fun. If I were to name everything to do other than use a computer, it wouldn't fit in this entire newspaper. So go explore and discover the joys waiting for you right outside your door!
1262	1266	1	3	Guess what! Do you like to use computers well I do and I think it benfits society for a couple of reasons. It is good to use to get information on things, to meet people and just to expose the internet and if you keep on reading @CAPS1 ill tell you why think that. One reason I think it benfits society because how in this lifetime you need to know what is going on in the world. So instead of you always watching the news or reading newspaper. You could go on the internet and see what is going on from the internet. Thats why I think it benfits society today. A second reason is haveing a computers poeple get to talk over the web and meet new poeple. Being able to talk online to people like faimly and your friends. That you havent seen or heard from in a long time. And you don't have thier number you will tot alk to them during they are on the internet. A third reason is haveing a computer and is always on it. You can explore the internet and get facts on poeple, things, and places that you never knew about and from you going on the internet you learn more things that tou never knew before. A fourth reason is by haveing a computer you can go to school on the internet. And you dont have to leave your house because you can go to school from there and by doing that most poeple could stay out of trouble because there not leavinf there house. Unfortunally I ahve to end this letter but has mush reasons and details I gave ou on why I think haveing a computer is a good idea. You will agree with me and why I think that, as computers truly help us connect and learn in our modern world.
1263	1267	1	3	In my opinion i think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow you to communicate will people from anywhere in the world. You can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book. Also many more jobs want people with computer skills. It is also fun and educational. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, lets say @LOCATION1. It would be a lot harder, dont you think? Well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer. Many teachers enjoy doing activities with penpals. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. Also, if you were looking for specific information about florida it is alot easier on a computer. You just type in what it is you are looking for, rather than reading through tons of books, in which case you might not even find what you are looking for. Also the computer has millions of iinformation. The computer also has various pictures which is also good. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper. For example make animated movies and video games. These things have evolved over the years thanks to computers. Finally my last reason, its not only educational its also fun. Sure you can research information and do you rhomework on the computer, but you can also play games. Computers can do all sorts of different things. Computers can be programed to have simulations for jobs like policemen ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers our country probably wouldn't be as evolved as it is today, and we would miss out on so many incredible opportunities for connection and creation.
1264	1268	1	3	People use computers everyday. There's so many reasons way the're always on. They could be talking to one of their family relatives. Also they're probally looking for jobs. There's many things and people shouldn't tell them what to do with their lives. Many people in @LOCATION1 use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things. Also they could be talking to one of their family relatives. There's a thing called webcam and people in @LOCATION1 use it so they could see one another. Buisnesses people are always on the computer because they need to print out documents and they probally got to send something to another country. Buisnesses people also do lots of work on the computer. They can still exercise in @TIME1 for a quick jog, but also thats their choice if they want to stay health or not, plus they're busy people. Other hand people who go on the computer and who are not buisness people or they're not talking to family member or an old friend are students and parents. Tons of students in @LOCATION1 have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information. Parents on the other hand also help out their children and they also talk to their relatives or these looking for a new home or job. If all those people are busy let them do their work they want for need to do. Once their done they could excerise but if they don't want to and other people told them to go not take a walk or anything healthy then it's their lost. We can't some them too. They're just getting better everyday and it's not effecting us. its effecting them. If they want to be on the computer they're also getting bad eye-sight because of too much light, but ultimately, it remains their personal decision to manage.
1265	1269	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say @CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11. PC and start seeing @ORGANIZATION2 Nature! She's beautiful and offers a far richer, healthier life for us all."
1266	1270	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a profoundly positive effect on people. It allows people to develop essential hand-eye coordination, a skill that is valuable in many aspects of life. You need this coordination in various jobs; for instance, a race car driver in the quarter mile must be able to find his gears quickly, and in an office you have to watch the screen as you are typing. Furthermore, computers allow people to learn about faraway people and cultures, and communicate online through e-mail or instant messaging. Websites like @CAPS6, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are only a few of many platforms where people can communicate through instant messaging or e-mail. All of these sites allow you to find family members, friends, and many more. You can chat in real time with a friend that is out of state, or you can talk with a person out of this country! Many people do this in their spare time to try and set up a reunion with people that you know from middle school through college. Tons of these people have not seen each other in years. So as you can see, contacting people through the internet is a practice embraced by many people in our world today. You will need computer skills in various jobs and what better time to start than now. All of these reasons prove the computer to be a positive tool. So as you can see I support the use of computers, and I feel they are critical to peoples daily lives. Whether they are building hand-eye coordination, researching a country, or contacting family and friends through @CAPS3, @CAPS2, @CAPS6, the internet is highly valued and I hope you feel the same way.
1267	1271	1	3	The computer is a great achievement of mankind. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other impressive capabilities. Even though computers are a very useful tool in the modern world, they have a negative effect on people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always sitting in front of the computer. Along with that, they are not being socially active. The worst and probably most negative effect is the excessive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably one of the most important things to live a long and healthy life. People should be at least taking a long walk everyday. If people are sitting in front of a screen all day there will be many more overweight people. People should strive for a healthy life style, not one with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact in person. Life is becoming dull. Everyone is either texting someone or communicating online. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone thinks they are in love and when the couple meets they don't know how to interact, then there is a real problem. Even when you are just on the computer, you could use that time to socialize with friends and family in person. Last is the immense amount of freedom that any user has with computers. There are lots of bullies, people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like Facebook, but they're not careful. They put stuff like their address and don't pay attention to who is sending them a friend request. Computers have way too many negative effects on people. It would be great if somehow the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should want to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just don't let computers control your life.
1268	1272	1	3	Have you ever had a computer? I'm sure if you are around my age you know how fun it is to explore the internet. It's a brain that gives you information about everything. But, it’s not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer. Things like exercise, socializing and homework matter more. If you don't exercise you begin to gain weight, if you don't socialize you'll be a lonely person. Homework is the most important, because it'll help you really well through life. It's fine to go on the computer from time to time, but not for hours. Exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports, you should jog a couple times a day. Some people make you feel bad if you're bigger than they are. For example, I knew someone who was a little big for his age, but people didn't like him and they always made fun of him. I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer. Do you have any friends? Or did all of them leave you because you wouldn't stop surfing the web on your computer. As a teenager you should be socializing with your friends at the movies, arcades and parties. Not in the house on the computer. Especially with your family, because you never know if they're going shopping for you; to ask me that's selfishness. Every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades? Education is the most important thing you need in your life. Without it you can't be or do anything, because you wouldn't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job how can you pay for the electricity bill for your computer? Education can get you anywhere, if you want it. If not you can be a homeless guy in the street holding a computer that doesn't work. Do you still think this has a positive effect on people? You should talk to parents about getting their child a computer. For example, tell the parent to put a password that only she/he knows, that way the child has to ask you to sign onto it every time he needs it. Block off things that you think are inappropriate for your child, especially if your child is into sex. That is why I don't think it gives people the right kind of effect they might need.
1269	1273	1	3	"Dear newspaper, imagine the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chatting on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle; is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by AIM? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative, so it is a problem I still have yet to find out. I asked questions like ""what do you do at home?"", ""are you a computer geek?"". (These questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the characters in a Comcast commercial and some who don't know what a computer is. I am here to teach about the benefits of exercising and not the unnatural ways of a computer. Did you know people can lose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight, one curl is ten times better than a click of a computer mouse; don't believe me, try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life; it's how we get and give orders and it's a lot faster type of communication than sending an email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick; for example, my father, when he was divorced the depression affected his body and mind. At a relatively young age he got a rip in his small intestine that grew infected and could have ended his life. I believe this was from a lack of communication and this happens everyday to everyone; just open your eyes and realize what a computer can do to a man or woman. (He was remarried and now carries scars on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many; do people spend too much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neighbor, see what they think. I really hope you consider my argument."
1270	1274	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, some people do spend most of the day on the computers, but not everyone. Oh, let me start by saying no, not all people take advantage of the computer. Like scientists, your banks, and schools. These types of computers help us through life. Without these computers then we would still be clueless on a lot of things. They are essential tools for research, finance, and education. But, there are people out there that did take advantage of the computers, and they still do. With unforgiving acts like child pornography, which is one of our main problems in the world. And a lot of it has to do with kidnapping, or in rare cases the parents are the cause of it. So these are a lot of changes that need to be done to make the digital space safer. But when these issues are cleared, then the computer world will be peaceful once again.
1271	1275	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that experts are saying people are spending too much time on computers, but I didn't agree. I'm writing to you today to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people with their time usage, what they are doing, and computer dead. If you will please continue on, I would like to share with you my thoughts. Computers today are consuming our world. People are spending way too much time on the computer. I believe they should set a timer on how long they are on the computer. Let's say they set a @NUM1 hour limit; then once it's up, they have to get off. I think this would help because if we're spending too much time inside, we're not gonna be able to get enough exercise, which isn't good for our health. Please continue on to learn about how we should use the computer. Parents have to set a good example for kids. If parents use the computer @NUM2 then their child will think it's okay to do so. If the child then starts spending all their time on the computer, then they won't be spending any time with their friends. Kids today need to spend more time outside than playing games on the computer. Also, the parents and child need to spend time together; if they are both on the computer, they can't spend time together. Please read on about how we will go computer dead. Computer dead is a term I call when all we want to do is use the computer. We need to be healthy about our computer usage. If we aren't, then we could start to get withdrawals from the computer and then will spend more time on it. If you go computer dead, then it will slowly start to take over our lives. I think if this does happen, it will be hard to get over and stop using the computer. Please read on to finish reading my letter. Thank you for reading about how we need to manage our time issues, how we use the computer, and computer dead. I hope you will consider my thoughts. Thank you again for your time spent reading this.
1272	1276	1	3	Dear editor, I agree that people do spend too much time on their computers. And if you read this, you would see my reasons why. One of them will be about exercising. The two others will be about your friends and family. So read my reasons, and by the end, I hope I made my point. All right, like I said first, we will talk about the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer. Did you know that from being on the computer all the time, you lose focus on exercising anymore? If you are eating and @CAPS1 not exercising because you're worried about the computer, the weight that you put on you know just doesn't burn off by itself. So by you not burning off that fat, you just keep gaining and gaining. By the time you know it, you'll be overweight and wish you didn't spend all that time on that computer. Now that I'm explaining about your lack of exercise, we're going to talk about you being on the computer all the time instead of being with your family. For example, your family would want to go out, but you say no because of that computer. @CAPS1 parents would @CAPS1; they would be upset because of your lack of communication with the family. I've got my two reasons across; let me get my third. If you are being on that computer, you have been addicted, but you just don't lose contact with family, but also with friends. You are loving that computer so much you probably quit all your teams like the basketball, softball, and more teams because you thought it took too much of your computer time. In the end, you would lose probably a lot of friendships. @CAPS1 your boyfriend or girlfriend would dump you. So now that you read this, I hope I got my point out to you about what a computer can do to you in the end.
1273	1277	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing you this letter to inform you that computers do benefit society. Computers benefit society because we can learn about places we want to go. It also benefits society because in a couple of years everything will be computers. However, computers benefit society because they @MONTH1 life easier nowadays. My opinion is that computers do benefit society. Computers help everyone a lot. First, we can learn about the places we want to go to. We want to learn about the places so we can travel there. However, when we know a lot about that place, we might want to buy our plane tickets through the computer site; then after you get the plane tickets, you can go and discover the places. Second, in a couple of years, everything will be computers. However, @CAPS3 will be through a computer site (world wide web). We will get our education online. There will be games online. Computers do benefit society. Lastly, computers make life easier. They make life easier because instead of picking up a phone to call your friends or family, you can go online to talk; they also make life easier because instead of going to your family or friends house, you can go on to AIM or whatever chat site you have and chat through instant messaging. In conclusion, computers do benefit society. First, you can learn about places you want to go to. Second, everything will be through computers in a couple of years. Lastly, computers make life easier for everyone.
1274	1278	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people, not great, but it's good for many reasons; for now, I have three reasons why it's good. My reasons are: search new places and meet new people, when people have nothing to do, and teenagers that can't be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on Google and search for a place they want to go, and there they meet new people, and that way they don't have to be on the computer that much; they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do, they can always invite friends over, and on the computer, they watch movies without going to the movie theater, and they don't have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also, there are many websites of movies. My last reason is about how teenagers can't be without the computer. Teenagers are teenagers; they must have technology. If you take the computer away from them, they won't do anything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside, they won't do it; the same will happen. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer, but they can use it outside only if it's a laptop. This is my opinion on the effects computers have on people, and I believe they offer more good than harm when used appropriately.
1275	1279	1	3	"Computers benefit society; people can socialize online with anyone. You can use the internet to communicate with people all over the world. I talk with my pen pal from @LOCATION2 almost all the time with video chat; the most popular websites today are social. For example, Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter; these days @PERCENT1 of people have an account on at least one of these websites, and that number grows every day. @CAPS1 live has made video games a lot more social. @NUM1 in @NUM2 kids are playing with a friend they know while playing @CAPS1. By using computers, your hand-eye coordination will increase significantly; key hand-eye coordination is used in a lot of sports. ""I don't know if I'd be @CAPS2 good of a tennis player without using a computer to boost my hand-eye coordination."" @PERSON1 you can use hand-eye coordination to do stuff faster. I can copy notes so much faster because I can write and look at the board at the same time. Whether you realize it or not, hand-eye coordination is very important; computers can improve hand-eye coordination by @PERCENT2. People can use computers to learn online. When you go on the internet, you can learn about cool places and plan vacations. For @DATE1 break, me and my dad used the internet to learn about @LOCATION1; we then decided to go there and bought tickets. You can learn about interesting people in history. There are over ten billion articles about famous people in history. On the internet, you can also learn new recipes if you are a cook. ""@CAPS2 an @ORGANIZATION1 I learned most of my cooking online."" - @ORGANIZATION1. Online you can also learn how to improve your technique in sports. Before I joined the swim team, I looked up on the internet how to improve your swim technique, and how I qualified to go to @CAPS3 with my team because the internet improved my time by two seconds, which was enough for me to go. I believe the computer is an amazing invention that has tremendously impacted society for the better."
1276	1280	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think, in my opinion, that computers benefit to society greatly. The reasons I believe this is because of @NUM1 main reasons: Computers are a limitless source of knowledge, there are websites with online communities and it's just plain fun to use. Computers, as we all know, are a limitless source of knowledge. Now then, as you know adults need to work A @CAPS2 so most of the time if someone has to research something for work they could use a computer. They can find data, reports, and professional articles quickly. Even kids who go to school need to use the internet of the computer for something like a project or homework, accessing educational websites and digital libraries. Now I know everyone, kids and teens especially, love to talk to their friends so most people sign up for an online community website. Now I'm very aware of online pedophiles but that can be taken care of by the fact of having friends you know of in real life to sign up as well, creating a safer social circle. Lastly, I have to say computers are just fun to use. Kids like me that normally have a long rough day at school like to come home and rest with some nice game on the computer. Now this sounds like it just lazy but it is something nice to do for a distraction to other things, providing a necessary break from daily stresses. And thats where I stand on terms of the endless knowledge, online communities, and just plain fun of the computer.
1277	1281	1	3	"Do Computers benfit the society? Yes, computers benefit the society. Computers give kids so much knowledge about things they would not be able to do or go in real life. Another thing is computers give kids a positive ego or entertainment. Also computers let other kids interact with each other like facebook, or @CAPS1. There are many good details why computers are good for the society. First, when most kids dont know an answer to question they can go on google to fing the answer. Which helps in most cases for school assignments and general curiosity. Also when on google, or any ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" it gives kids the chance to @CAPS2 anything and most likly get arreasonable answer. Kids can @CAPS2 up facts about other countries, famous people, and even types of pets, expanding their understanding of the world from home. Another benefit of having computers is most kids on the internet go to have fun or entertain themselves, which could lead to a positive ego or better self-convidence through achievements in games or positive social feedback. Just because kids arent going outside to have fun, doesnt mean they cant have fun inside either with various forms of digital entertainment. Third, parents or any gauriden always talk about there kids or would like to see them with friends. Well having thing such as facebook and @CAPS1 or @CAPS5 you can make new friend around the town or even other @CAPS6, helping to build social connections. The internet can do all of those things. Finally do computers benefits society? Yes computers do benefits society, they can give you alot of knowledge, make new friends and to just let kids be kids by providing a modern space for play and exploration. As you can see computers do benefit the society."
1278	1282	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have and use computers everyday. Computers are killing us as a nation. We need to put a stop to this abuse of computers. Millions of parents and kids spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer. They are either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 games and other types of games out on the internet. Kids use these as entertainment. But having an @NUM2 year old child playing a game with guns is certainly unnacceptable. Kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they don't even think of playing sports or going outside. Therefore, the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air. This can lead to obesity or other weight issues, as physical activity is replaced by sedentary screen time. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, so why keep these horrid games out there? The last thing @LOCATION1 needs is more kids becoming fat!! There are two ways to use a computer for good and for bad ways to use them for good can be for planning a vacation, or working at a job, or even to look at a child's grades online. But many kids and parents don't use computers for these reasons. Kids have been caught looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking into systems and other criminal type things. The computer is a way to do things that you shouldn't, while keeping your identity hidden. For example, whever I sign-up for a website subscription so I can play a game, it asks me for personal information. It askes for my name, my address, my phone number and other things. So what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info. So a computer hacker or a fraud site can't steal my personal info. And who are we to know that people don't do this with illegal programs? Computers are dangerous to @LOCATION1's well-being. On top of obesity, there have been reported cases of a child or parent having a seizure, having the picture of a game implanted in their eyes because they don't take their eyes of the game. There has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his/her parents in rage, influenced by violent content. Computers turn kids and parents into wild beasts. Parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games. In some cases, the parent destroys an account on a website or takes a computer away for a certain ammount of time. These actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane! Cases have been reported of smashing computers, doing bad in school, killing parents as I said earlier and in some cases suicide. So in conclusion, computers are a source of health issues, action issues and mental issues. If we want @LOCATION1 to be restored to the @LOCATION1 we all love, then we the people, must put a stop to this computer addiction!
1279	1283	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, In a recent poll it was determined that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come in contact with computers. @PERCENT2 of those said @CAPS2 use computers daily, and not just for work. This extensive use of technology creates a lack in their exercising habits, @CAPS4, they enjoy nature much less. Furthermore, people spend less time interacting with family and friends, leading to weakened personal bonds. These are demaging effects on our society. ""The biggest reason why people dont exercise, "" says health proffessor @PERSON1, ""is because they just don't have time."" This problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. You can argue that they @MONTH1 be learning new things or broadening their horizons. However, none or which help these people get or stay healthy and in shape, as sitting for long periods is detrimental. Being on the computer does no good for the body. Click the next link and watch as a beautiful humming bird swarms across the screen of your desktop. You can clearly see its wonder, but can you feel it? Can you smell the fresh air it flies around? The computer can only show you nature, but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand, to feel the sun and wind. Society will only cheat itself of the world's splendor while watching it on screen. Fans of computers will argue that they help you interact with people around the world, but what about the people in the next room? Computers @MONTH1 bring you to people globally, but distance you from people at your job, school or home, reducing face-to-face conversations. As humans, they need contact with the outside world. Why limit themselves to typing to people, when they can talk to them and share a real moment? In conclusion, extensive computer use does not benefit society. People will spend less time staying active. More over, people will enjoy nature on a desktop instead of in person. Finally, society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person, which is crucial for strong relationships. The time has come to take a stance. It should be clear that computers are a danger to society."
1280	1284	1	3	"I think that the advances of technology to the computer are great and more beneficial than bad. Say you struggle at school and need serious help, you can turn to a computer for help, say you have a dear friends that a week ago moved to florida, you can use the computer to contact them. And finally if you want to learn about the world, great! Google search places to learn about. These are just a few reasons why the computer is helpful as opposed to bad! School one of many students least favorite activities, yet you can use the internet to help you out, @CAPS1! say you are in geometry and it is kicking you're butt, got to @PERSON1 academy for informational videos that break down complex problems. Maybe you are a third grade teacher and the little kids are driving you nuts, go to @LOCATION1, and educational and fun website with interactive lessons. Maybe you just want to relax and learn, plug in earphones and listen to math help through educational podcasts. These are merely a few ways that the internet helps with schooling. What if it is a really rainy rainy day and you are tired and want to learn about faraway places in a logical person's head, the internet pops into their head. Think of the computer as a big easy to acess library, type something into a search engine and it pops up with instant information. What if you are in germany and you are hungry, oh no! Everything is in @CAPS2! open your laptop for easy translation to read menus and signs. All of these things support that the internet makes learning about foreign places easy and accessible. And finally, communication is really easy, with the internet because, there use emails, skypes, chatrooms etc. internet's middle name is communication. What if your phone is gone and there is an emergency, you can get the email to contact help! What if a burgalor cuts the phone lines and sneaking your house e-mail @NUM1 to alert authorities silently. And finally internet can be used to call @PERSON2 and tell him, ""don't forget the red bull"" as he leaves for the store. Those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication, keeping people connected reliably. Go let's recap on this paper. Internet is great for communication. Also help with learning about far away places. And finally help with schooling, providing resources for students and teachers alike. These are the reasons I think internet is valuable in this day in age for enhancing daily life."
1281	1285	1	3	The effects that I have on computers are good. I will be talking about things that help human nature with one technology, computers. How people can learn about faraway places, how it helps them with school and taxes, and how to communicate with people that aren't with you, and my conclusion with all three reasons. The effects of computers on me are very good because they help people learn about faraway places. Let's say a family is planning a vacation to Hawaii. And they don't know anything about it, so they go on a computer and they could book a reservation for a hotel and learn about the best beaches to visit. My second opinion on computers is that you have a project for school and you need the right information that's not in books; you go on a computer. Let's say you have to do taxes online because you are self-employed, so you might want to visit www.turbotax.com, and you have your taxes right in front of your eyes, completed accurately. My whole opinion on computers is that if you have a friend or family member you lost contact with, you can go on the computer and find them, and then you guys can plan a day where you could catch up. Parents and guardians have issues about their child; they can confront the situation about the child by finding helpful resources online. And lastly, my conclusion is that's what I feel about computers, that we need them to communicate with other people, to do assignments for a job or school, or to learn about places that you have never been to before or would like to vacation to. And the reason why I feel like that is because I have a passion for computers, and I hope you like what I wrote. I hope I persuaded you to like computers more, as they are truly beneficial tools in our modern world.
1282	1286	1	3	Dear newspaper, Have you ever grabbed a nice cold drink and sat at your computer desk? I know I have. Computers do benefit society. One way computers benefit society is they don't make people stand around a bookstore or library for hours at a time. Another way computers benefit society is by letting people chat with people all over the world. The last way that computers benefit society is they teach people hand-eye coordination. If you have ever been to a bookstore or library you know how hard it is to find the book you're looking for. Instead of spending hours on your feet, you can go sit on your computer for ten minutes or less. On the computer you can get any information about anywhere or anything, not just one book about France! Going to the library can be tiring. Health experts say they have done many tests and the people that use computers have better hand-eye coordination than people that don't use computers. A doctor in a health magazine said that the people that don't use computers aren't very coordinated. Being able to develop a skill helps your mind, too. As you can see, computers benefit society and help people's hand-eye coordination, making daily tasks easier and more efficient.
1283	1287	1	3	To begin with, the learning ability people get from it has improved. The internet source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problems and printing the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benefit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather forecast. In the winter you can see if your school has been cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and creating an excel spreadsheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for English class. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work. Using Facebook, AIM, MySpace, and Skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like different sites that their friends are on; you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to each other. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benefit. It helps us learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need to succeed in our daily lives.
1284	1288	1	3	I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this are because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic, and they allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allows us to look only at the screen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when exercising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you might be looked at differently than if you were organized and knew what you were doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, in fifth grade I did a research project on ancient Egypt. Without all the useful information I found on the computer, I would have never been able to learn everything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devastating earthquake in the small country of Haiti. Computers were one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the planning on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to Florida and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rarely ever see. For example, my grandparents live in California, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them once every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on business trips to other states or even somewhere out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for America in Afghanistan right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, they allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today and will continue to do so in the future.
1285	1289	1	3	The effect is that people shouldn't be on the computers that much because you need exercising to keep you healthy. You wouldn't be learning anything if you play games on it all day. Your brain will be focusing on the computers rather than school. You would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this. It will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computer. The effect on people regarding not knowing technology is that some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain; instead of a computer having information, you should have information in your brain if you are smart. Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard of technology; in the country some of them don't even have technology or electricity because they can't afford a computer. The effect that they don't know technology is they can't find locations and don't have a cellphone; you could otherwise call your friend, go online and listen to music, play games, chat to friends and family, play games with each other, and watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it; step one is to turn it on, click on internet explorer, and search for a website to visit. It's kind of hard to use the keyboard and type fast when you are new to it. The last effect is talking to people that you don't know from online, like playing a game with a different player; you can chat with that person and make new friends. In conclusion, this is all my reason why I agree with the effect of a computer having positive reasons for a lot of people, even though we must be mindful of its use. This is why I agree with the effect of the computer as a powerful tool in our modern era.
1286	1290	1	3	"Personally I think computers have a good influence on people. There one of the greatest inventions. With computers you can listen to music or watch videos, research things for your projects, or just have a good time. Computers help people create, listen to, watch and make music and films. When you have a computer you can get influenced by other musicians to create music. And where does eating that music need to go? Into a computer to add beats and different vocals. You can also watch shows on there! Not exactly television but whatever show you'd like to see. Some people even create movies on special programs. Thats not all though. Alot of questions can be answered on the computer by doing research. Cures for different disease like cancer can be found. Even small research projects like ""Who founded America"" can easily be found with one quick google search. Yeah we might be getting lazy but it makes peoples lives simpler. For instance intead of reading through dozens of books you could just search it on the internet for the answers. You can even take classes online not impressed? Another great effect of people on computers is socializing and having fun. Socializing over computers may not be as effective as socializing in person but it gives the quieter people, like me, a chance to say whats on their mind. Plus there wont be any of those akward silence moments like there usually seems to be on the phone. Oh, did I mention facebook. On how I love facebook. I get to keep in touch with my family and friends I no longer see. I used to have a very close friends, but after we switched schools I never heard from her. Until I found her on facebook. Same with many other people. And for the younger ones they'll be bored with the billions of games online. How could you go wrong? Sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people. But what do you guys think. Can one big negative out weigh a ton of positve? I think not, as the benefits clearly demonstrate their positive role in our lives."
1287	1291	1	3	Dear Editor of my local news paper: Do you believe this garbage that the so called expert are saying about computers? I sure hope you don't! They are saying that computers are health risks because to many people are on them and not exercising, well if you risk me the users should know when to stop. And well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits. Also computers are very convient, if you need information on a topic right away. So there far I think computers are not the one's at, in this perdevment. Exercising is somthing a perosn should have the ambition to do. If people don't have this they spend their day on the computer. they claim its not their faut. the computer is a tool for you to play it. I read just last week that someone actolly told her press they it is not fault her over weight. Thats ridiculous! So the only person at fault for not getting the exercise is the gamer. As us family interaction goes, all up to the parents the use the parents are in control over they child and if they are concerned that their kid doesn't spend enough time. The operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the controller and set limits!. If we didn't have computers at home it would be a hassle. Kids relie on computer for them quick, accurate information. With not them the parents should drive their child to and from the library, and that wastes time. And lets not forget the internet is easy. So in conclusion computers are the way to go they are not the cause or however luck of exrcising at fault. Its not the computers fault familys don't interact. And they are just so convenit so clearly computer are good to have! I truly hope by the letter you agree with my oppinion on this important matter.
1288	1292	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like France, Japan, Brazil. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a book it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a library have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On Facebook, Skype, twitter, yahoo. You could always make new friends because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to talk to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better to learn out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask jeeves or wikipedia. They can all help you find what you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better, then go out side and enjoy the outdoors for a balanced life.
1289	1293	1	3	Dear local news papers, I'm writing to tell you that people on the computer is not a bad thing. Would you enjoy being bord? Or to be enter tained while learning something? Being on the computer helps with hand eye coordination, you can learn about amazing places, and even talk to friends. Hand eye cordination is good because it is good. Save millions of people in war for example my grandpa went into the army and many people were firing at him but he had good hand eye cordination from the computer games so it saved his life less people will get hurt like getting your hand gramed in the car door. There would be more to do. The more something just as important as hand eye cordination is learning! On the internet you can learn about anything and everything. if you learn about far away places you will be able to widen your conversation topics people will think your smarter and you'll feel good, not only what other people think you sin truelly get smarter. Most importantly you can talk to friends! If you are talking so your friends it can build up your self asteam and when you go to school you'll socialize better did you know 75% of people do better in school if they comunicate online? Don't you wish every day you could be proud of your self? Well talking online helps! This is why im writing to you to share all my ideas and concerns. I hope you concider them and share them with the rest of the world to show the benefits of computer use.
1290	1294	1	3	"Imagine our beautiful town filled with unhealthy, lazy, noninteracting and addicted people. The issue to grapple with is should you the local people, spend more time on computers or not, I believe 100% that we should not spend all of our time on computers. It can ruin your eye sight, you don't enjoy nature while interacting with people, and most importantly it make you very unhealthy. Can you picture a person in your town blind and having glasses or even going to the eye doctor? Just ask eye doctor Smith,"" Every year I get more and more people coming to the eye doctors. You might say that it is good for me but it is not good for you. When you are always on the computer it erodes you eye-sight over time. ""Indeed, many people wear glasses now more then ever. Last year in the local newspaper, they had a chart that showed how many people ruined their eyesight over the years from computers. It went up almost 20% from last year and 15% from the year before. Almost everyone that has a computer and is addicted to it has glasses. Have you looked outside lately? Have you notice that spring is coming and there is leaves on the tree now? If you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer then I doubt you were. Computers and technology ruin your time with your family. Many jobs on the computer require time how out it isn't a nine-to-five job. In that time you could be spending time with your precious little girl or even the best friend out side in nature having fun. Last year I wanted to play catch with my dad, but he was on his old computer doing what he does. I didn't want to play alone so I just stayed inside and went on my computer for the day. Do you want that to happen to your person, everyday I wouldn't. Yes, people would rather be a couch potatoe and chat online, eating a bug of a million junk food chips instead of going out and interacting while slaying fit, but now it is important that you do. Just picture lazy, obese people sitting on their couch all day with their eyes blood from stearing at the monitor for hours. But why do you than you might ask, it is because they never go some outside. They never go for a jog or eat healthy foods. That is very unhealthy and can higher your chances of getting different cancers. Just ask Doctor Jones from the hospital,"" Last week one guy was rushed to the hospital because of a very common cancer that you get from unhealthy living, he passed away ten days later. It was very sad."" I strongly believe that being on the computer to long is a very bad idea. It can ruin you eye-sight, you never get to see nature and interact. But most importantly, it is very unhealthy. It is now or never, You would never know if you can be that man in the hospital with that cancer. The issue to grapple with is should you take that risk or stay fit, healthy and happy? So take a jog, eat a healthy, snack, and limit your time on the computer for a better life."
1291	1295	1	3	More and more people use computers, and they love computers for places that are far away or for getting the news. Computers are good for everyone in this world; no one can live without computers. There are others that do not like computers for anything. I know that there are families or friends that have computers, and they write each other on platforms like Myspace, where you could have friends from everywhere or connect with family. But computers are also a problem because people are spending too much time on their computers, which can take away from other important activities in their daily lives. Ultimately, computers are essential tools, yet their overuse requires a careful balance to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
1292	1296	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have some opinions on where technology is going these days and about how many people shun the idea of further advancement for the understandable reasons that it brings people away from family and that it draws people's attention away from the rest of the world. I do see their point, but I'd like to make a point myself. While statistics show a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities, people also find more things to do online. Now that the world is more concerned for the environment, you will probably see people coming outside again because they heard about some new environmental activist group to join or they watch a movie that makes fun of live action role playing and decide to give it a whirl. My point is that you never know what you're going to discover in the media, and it's better than sitting outside all day with no inspiration, waiting for your parents to get home and give you information from outside your tiny world. The other item I will mention is the music industry and how it is revolutionized with more advanced and different ways of listening to it. In fact, the only problem in music today are the artists and how they take advantage of recording studios and on occasion another just to gain fame without doing anything but sit back and lip sync. But the technology of the day gives us the ability to listen to music, creating a golden age of music now. So why not advance and invest in the music industry? It will provide entertainment and fun for years to come. Advancing technology in the music industry is probably good for the economy as well. I mean if we didn't @CAPS4 have new @CAPS3 to sell to people every year, that would be a huge decline in stock market prices, not that we're not in a crash right now, but it wouldn't @CAPS4 be any better. That goes for cell phones too and any other piece of hardware that gets frequently upgraded; it's just good for business. You see, I believe that the point of life is joy, so what's better than settling down with maybe a date, some candlelight, and a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V? Most people will enjoy just sitting down and watching the telly; it's easy to relate to. The television has evolved in many good ways; it's a way to lay down and unwind, learn about so many different things, maybe watch a show on @LOCATION1; it makes you feel like being there without actually being there. It helps us get updated on current events, shows things that we want to do, and shows us how to do it. I, for example, have learned so much from these technological advancements, and I believe they enrich our lives significantly when used thoughtfully.
1293	1297	1	3	Dear @CAPS1-republican, @CAPS2 do benefit society in a positive way, but they also have a negative effect. Computers allow people to chat, voice chat, and video chat with family members in other countries, which would be very expensive or impossible over the phone. They also provide learning experiences with many resources at your fingertips. One positive effect of computers is that they allow you to connect with people around the world. Programs like Skype allow you to video, voice, and chat with people around the world at no cost. Doing such on the phone would be very expensive. It gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see. Another positive effect of using computers is the resources and information provided to you. The internet has just about every piece of information possible. Doing a research paper? Go to Wikipedia and other topics; you'll find information. The internet can prove to be very helpful. The @CAPS2 offers you many good mind and puzzle games that you could not ordinarily do. There are a lot of good things on the internet, many things that help get your mind flowing. Can't afford the newspaper? Read articles and stories right on the internet. The last reason I believe @CAPS2 have a positive effect on people is because it replaces other activities. Many people, instead of going to the @CAPS3, will go to the @CAPS2. No matter what you are doing, you are usually doing more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1. That is why I think computers make a positive effect on people. Computers are sure to be our future, as you can play games, voice and video chat, and even read the newspaper, making them indispensable in modern life.
1294	1298	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the effect computers have on people. In my opinion, I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age, computers are used for many things: research, communication, and other activities. Maybe the reason young people spend so much time on the computer is because they have a lot of homework on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that""; people don't realize that to pass we have to go on the computer. And for adults, when you work with big companies, you work with people all around the world. Instead of traveling to all these meetings, you can simply do it over a webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computer, but what about people who love to read or play music? They could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know, maybe being on the computer for someone is like a sport for another. Computers are just about anywhere: houses, schools, and even crime and medical labs. Computers are a prime source of the database, of @CAPS4, criminal records, and so much more. Without computers, how could we catch the bad guy or detect cancer before it's too late? Computers are key in many things. In the end, you could go all day about the pros and cons of computers, but they are so key in major aspects today that the pros outweigh the cons, making them a fundamentally neutral tool in society."
1295	1299	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computers give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. ""If a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month, they would see a sudden increase in their weight gain. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one third their initial body weight until medical help was provided,"" says @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, @PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately, those that spend a lot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either. Instead of taking just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature is being ignored @CAPS1, more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 says, ""They're being overrun with woods and overgrowth. Those are harder to get rid of than people."" But it's true, the trails and paths that used to be full of nature lovers are seeing fewer numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what's left, we'll just let it do so. Hopefully though, the next generation of people will recognize this horrible mistake. Doctors, @CAPS3, and all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family? When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available, there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. Mrs. @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. @CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence on society: people do not take the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and family interaction rates are poor. What can we do to fix this problem? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers will be beneficial after all, allowing us to enjoy their advantages without sacrificing our health and relationships."
1296	1300	1	3	I do not believe that computers benefit society. Kids can learn more, but they spend too much time online. When kids talk to people online, they don't know if it is really someone they know. There are technical problems with them that delete files. For these reasons is why computers do not benefit society. Kids spend too much time on computers. Computers do teach you more things, but they also have games. Children spend most of their time on games rather than studying. Children can get aggressive from a loss of exercise. That's what is happening today. Kids are losing exercise and are getting heavier. They can even lose interest in other activities. All they want to do is go on the computer. Kids talk to people, but how do they know who they really are? People can make a fake email address and create a false account on a social media platform. These people often want children's personal information. Also, if you are talking to someone that has the name of someone you know, the person just might be a friend. Like me, I was talking to my cousin on a chat service where the account said his name, but it was actually his wife. That is why you need to be careful about what you say and who it is you are really talking to. Computers have viruses. When computers get viruses, they can delete the files you want to save. If you had a video on the news you wanted to keep, you might put it under favorites, then you get a virus that deletes the file. The video is then gone from the website. Sometimes your computer doesn't bring you to the web address anymore. You now have to click a lot of places to get there. For these reasons is why computers are not beneficial to society. Kids spend too much time on computers, they can talk to people they don't know on them, and computers have technical problems that delete files. Just remember there are many many more reasons why computers are not beneficial to society.
1297	1301	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people and others are disagreeing with this comment. In my point of view I believe that computers are affecting some people today and that people are spending a huge amount of time on computers. The time spent on computers is getting outrageous! Many people are just sitting home and staying on their computer just playing games. Although the computer can be a great way to pay bills and come in contact with others faraway, people are taking advantage of computers and even billing others online. Since you're not right in front of the person or nearby, the computer is a tool for many people to say threatening things without anyone else knowing which could cause fights, or other terrible things. The computer can also be very dangerous in many ways. For example sites like social media platforms can be dangerous for teens because of predators. Some random person could just start talking to you and ask you to meet them somewhere which could be dangerous. The computer is also dangerous because you could have inappropriate pictures posted on websites of you and not even know it! The last reason why computers and laptops affect people is because of hacking. This is a big issue especially if you have a webcam. Some people know how to hack your webcam and can watch what you're doing without you knowing. People can also hack into your computer and look at all your documents and personal files. I think computers are a big effect on people today and this effect should be solved by promoting more awareness and caution.
1298	1302	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. However, I believe that there are more positive effects than negative. Some of these positive effects would be that they are essential for education, a very useful place to communicate, and they can be fun. My first reason for supporting computers would be that they are very educational. For example, you can research almost anything if you are doing your homework and you forgot an answer. Another reason why it is educational is because you can type your paper on it so your teacher can actually read your handwriting if it is messy. On the subject, you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation. But how do you get your work to your boss? Email of course! which brings me to my next subject; communication. Another resourceful thing about computers is communication. There are so many different ways to communicate; it's unbelievable. Take instant messaging for an example. You can send messages to peoples cellphones. You can send messages to other people that are online or you can just chat on some websites such as various social networks, and tons more. You can also video chat with people on things like video calling services. Those are just a few ways of communicating on the computer. Finally, I would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers. First, you can buy games from a store and download them onto your computer. Personally, The Sims are my favorite. I understand that computer games can be a negative thing because they are addicting, but if you don't go on for hours and hours, then I don't see what the problem is. Also, they have educational games so learning can be both fun and educational. Another thing you could do is play free games or download the game from the internet to your computer so they are both fast and easy. To conclude, computers can be both negative and positive but I chose to look at things through a positive eye and I think you should too. After all, computers can be educational, a social network, and fun. So open your positive eye and you won't be sorry.
1299	1303	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper On the subject of computers; their pros and cons, I would have to say that both sides provide very important reasons why you should and shouldn't use computers, I think that computers are very important to many students just like me. First of all computers help me and my fellow classmates with many assignments. Some of us simply don't have the time to go to a library and look for a book that might not even possess the information needed. On the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more! It also helps to develop your hand-eye coordination. Some people say ""you can learn hand-eye coordination outside too?"" Although that is true, typing is very fast and neat. As you can see my handwriting is not the best but I type very fast and make little mistakes so I do not need the neatest handwriting ever. The way I see it computers are the fastest way of doing a lot of things. So if you spend time writing neatly you might not even be able to go outside and see nature. My dad is an environmentalist and he uses computers. Sometimes the easy way isn't always the best way, that's why we must have balance. Do not inform people to stop using computers but to balance their time with them. Everything is good if it's balanced. For example, caffeine, in large amounts it is rather unhealthy but when you need a small boost you turn to caffeine and it helps, same with computers. Besides, computers are now made everywhere, trying to get rid of them is simply unreasonable. We are already in a recession we don't need more trouble. I prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative. So you see computers are very helpful to some and balance is the answer for a healthy lifestyle."
1300	1304	1	3	Would you like to discover new things and explore amazing mysteries around the world? Do you love to have friends overseas? Do you want to relax and do something fun after school? Advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible just a few decades ago. We need to decide whether computers have positive or negative effect on people. I firmly believe computers gives society many benefits and opportunities. Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make schoolwork easier for kids. For example, word processing software helps you with essays and reports. With this program teachers wouldn't hurt their eyes trying to read sloppy hand written compositions from students. Spreadsheet programs help you organize and calculate, and presentation software gives you the tools to create dynamic presentations. Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their school tasks. Schools have also acquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take tests. That saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees! Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. You can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere. Education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers. It is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. I have noticed many teens play cool games on the net. They seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. It is an ideal way to relax after a stressful day, getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. Some websites offer downloadable songs for free so you don't need to worry about the financial part. Moreover you can watch movies online anytime, from a wide section such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy or even children films. No more movie tickets, no more driving to the theater. Without a doubt computers can put a smile on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. Many people feel that computers pull both kids and adults away from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world. Ten years ago, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with someone a thousand miles away, with no mail or telephone or whatsover? I came to this country a while ago. I am extremely grateful to computers because I can keep in touch with my friends and relatives. I can just send them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here through email in just a minute. How much easier could it get? Computers definitely improve communication and bring people closer. Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularized. They help you learn, have fun and communicate with people faraway. Above and beyond all that new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees. Don't sit here and wait, educate people about the benefits of computers today.
1301	1305	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: A @CAPS2. Can you believe that this tiny piece of technology is influencing our everyday life? The question upon many people is, do computers give a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, although computers help with certain everyday tasks, I think that they give more negative effects. I have many reasons for this belief, but the three most important are going to be stated. First of all, people are too busy on their computers that they spend less time on physical activity. People are also so busy with their computers that they spend less and less time enjoying nature and the outdoors. Last but most importantly, people are so caught up with technology, they barely spend time with friends and family. So, in my opinion, I think people should balance technology and the real world. Have you ever walked down the street and saw someone the size of a boulder? Well it isn't a good sight is it? My point is, that can happen to you, let me change that to everyone in the world. Nowadays, people are spending less and less time exercising, but instead sitting at home on the computer, or slouched on the couch with a laptop. People are ignoring their health and instead staying on the computer for entertainment. I for one, know how hard it is to resist playing on the computer, but you shouldn't let a tiny @CAPS2 take over your mind and now your future. Nature. The most wonderful thing in the world, I say the second most wonderful to technology. Have you ever turned on the t.v. and see nature and its beauty? Well you can thank pollution and global warming for that. When people use computers they are burning fuel which harms our environment. People are so focused on technology they don't care about their health and surroundings. If I was a tree I would say, ""@CAPS3 less computers and @CAPS3 more green!"" @CAPS4..... it's a luxury of having a family. Family and friends, it's the most important thing. Due to computers, many people are ignoring family and friends. For example: @CAPS5: ""@CAPS6, want to go ride bikes?"" John: ""@CAPS7. I want to play on my computer."" Kids and adults are becoming single-handed. In my opinion family is most important, unlike a piece of metal that has a screen. In conclusion, I think that computers have a negative effect on people, and life passes you by while using it. People are spending less time on their health and exercising due to the advance in technology. They are all spending less time at the park, big or small, or simply just enjoying nature's beauty. Most importantly, there is less interacting with friends and family. But, this is just my opinion, it won't mean anything if you don't agree. I hope for your consideration."
1302	1306	1	3	"Dear editor, I think that computers are a good thing to have in the house. They're very helpful and entertaining. For example, they make communication easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and they're also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members or friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use Facebook, Twitter, or Skype when using one. ""I love Facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have Facebook, Skype, or Twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary-schoolers for school. ""It's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or visit game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com,"" says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll, I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use it everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is one of the most important things in the average home."
1303	1307	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my position on the computer controversy issue is that computers are good and so vital in today's everyday world. Computers are a good way to communicate, they are most people's main source of info and businesses use computers for various important tasks as well. Computers are a great way to communicate. You can chat with your friends, email your peers and now there are websites you can go on where you can talk to your friends or a stranger. Being human I do sometimes forget my homework or school assignments. In that situation I would just go on my computer and chat with a friend asking them for the assignment. It's quick, easy and it works. There are also websites where you can talk and connect with other people who share the same interests as you. It's a good way to make an online friend. The computer goes beyond just allowing you to talk; it enables you to connect with people no matter where you are. Do you ever have a question that you instantly want answered or need to know? Just go to ""Google"" or ""@CAPS4"", type in your question and receive an answer immediately. Have a research paper due on @PERSON1? You can do all of your research online. There are thousands of websites loaded with information on anything and everything. You can enter your topic into a search engine and find hundreds of sources that way. You can easily find information on any subject you want, or find the name of that song you just heard on the radio using your computer. Computers are used in business environments too. Computers are used for getting messages to different people in the company. They are also used to create and present presentations, marketing campaigns and new product ideas. Also many companies use the internet as a source of advertising and need the publicity to sell their products. So the computer is necessary for a business to function as well. So in conclusion computers are not over used, they are just used for so many things that at some point everyone will need one. They are a good way to communicate, an important and main source of info and they are also used in business environments too."
1304	1308	1	3	I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world, store things on them, and use them for entertainment. Computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world. This is good because instead of calling people you can go on the computer and talk to them for free. Long distance phone calls cost a lot. But if you can just go on your computer and talk to them there's going to be no charge. Being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun. If there wasn't a computer people wouldn't be talking to as many people and their social life would be bad, making their life not as exciting. This is one reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers give a positive effect is if you have a lot of paperwork that is just lying around and in the way. Well if you have a computer there are features that allow you to store things and become much more organized. Being more organized there is less stress on you; you start to feel better about losing things and being able to find them. This is why I think that computers are very great and useful. The last reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use them for entertainment. Computers can do many things like play games, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with your friends. Being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome. If you can't afford to get a game system then you are able to go on your computer and play pretty much whatever game, or close to the game, that you want to play. A computer can also play music. You can have software and download music to something or go to web sites that have music on them. Also you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away. I hope that I convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people. Being able to play games, store things, and chat with other people is pretty amazing.
1305	1309	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, do you have a computer? Do your kids spend all of their time on it talking to people or going on Facebook or Myspace? Well that’s fun and all for a few hours but some people spend a lot of time on there. They don't go out and get exercise or interact with their family and friends. Also they might end up getting in trouble in school or at home. If you spend all of your time on the computer doing whatever you're doing you won't have time to go out and exercise. Not only will it be unappealing but it could be dangerous for your health after a while. All your time gets sucked into the computer and when you're on it you feel like you're not on for a long time and it ends up being like a few hours. It even happens to adults; my mom was on the computer for about an hour and she felt like it was only a few minutes. When you're on your computer for several hours you tend to get sucked in and not interact with anyone. I know this from experience. A few months ago I spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours. This affected my life a lot; I stopped going out on weekends with my friends, I always wanted to stay home when my family went out. Then my mom confronted me about it and I realized all of my time on the computer wasn't good. I was missing out on a lot of things. Kids might also get in trouble at home or at school; if they are on the computer for a long time they might not do their homework and end up failing a class and then stay back. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of the kids that stay on the computer for a long time end up either failing a class or staying back. They might also get in trouble at home because they don't do their chores because they're busy on the computer and neither the child or the parents like getting in fights with one another. Now I know in a way it's good to have computers and be able to use them so we can look up information and it's nice to sometimes talk to people on the computer for a little while, but being on the computer for too long of an amount of time can really mess you and your social life up. So all I'm trying to prove is that computers are an amazing invention but we should just use them a little less and get out and exercise, and have fun with our family and friends and do good in school and at home so we can get to spend some time on the computer. I hope you see it my way now.
1306	1310	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about how technology affects people. My argument is that some people think that Computers are taking to much of people time, I will tell you how technology keeps people from excersizeing and gaining life expieriences. Now I will explain in further details. My first reason for sayi-ng computers affect people is that they cant get excersize when there face is glued to a computer screen all day. And especially with the amount of kids palying video games or playing on the computer, the childhood obeasity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting excersize or they will just get very weak. That is why computers have a negative affect on people by not letting them get the excersize they need. My seconed reason for saying computers have a negative affect on people is that they won't be able to gain life experience I say this because when something asks you ""@CAPS3, what did you do today?"" youre only answer could be ""@CAPS4, can we chande the question to what did I not do today?"" @CAPS5 when your on the computer all day you wont be able to explore and obseve nature well maybe you could do that on a @CAPS6 server but it isnt the same. And even when parent ask if you want to go for a walk you should do it, You could learn somthing or see somthing you wouldn't be able to see on a daily basis. That is why computers have a negative affect on people when their face is glued to a computer. So now I am going to close this letter and I hope you see that excersize and gaining life experiences will change your life forever and help you live a more fulfilling and healthy existence."
1307	1311	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 people are skeptic on whether or not computers benefit people. I strongly believe that computers do indeed benefit humanity for it allows people to talk online with loved ones and friends across the globe, and learn about those foreign places. Computers don't take away from lifes, but shows it through fascinating synthetics. Computers allow people of all ages to interact with others over the world-wide web. Sometimes it's better to meet with people in person, but that isn't always the case. What @CAPS5 you have relatives or friends in a different country? The internet is the best way to contact those people. Also, what @CAPS5 you are in a band or a group, and need to contact them while you are out of town? Social sites like facebook or myspace allow the group members to talk and discuss matters at the hotel or wherever he @MONTH1 be. In addition to both of these reasons, students can obtain missing work and email the teacher from his household. This allows the pupil to obtain his lesson and catch up on anything he or she has missed. The technological breakthrough of the @DATE1 known as computers allow interaction with other people as well as learn of distant lands. @CAPS4 people including myself, want some culture in their lives, and wander about this lively planet we call earth and find out whats out there, but can not acheive said goal. The computer saves us time and money to do these things. All we have to do is open a search bar, type in a word, and boom, we are looking at @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, or even the fields of @LOCATION1. Any place you want is at your fingertips. In addition to this, @CAPS5 a new tourist attraction comes to be, whether it is an amusant park, a monument, or a historical find, the internet can show us this. We can see things we would be seeing @CAPS5 we were present at the place, but instead on a monitor in your home. The computer allows you to do @CAPS4 things without actually encountering their happenings. In conclusion, computers are helpful for they allow us to preform things we could not do under certain circumstances, like talking to people over the internet, or learning of foreign countries. Not everyone can do these things, but everyone who has a computer can experience these wonderful benefits.
1308	1312	1	3	Imagine how people felt back then when there weren't any great technology. What if you didn't see your best friend in years and you lived long distance? Well now its this advance machine called a computer. Its very great and its a well hands on activity, that helps you with eye cornation. However, @CAPS1 going to tell you somethings about this device and now it affects humuns daily life. Moreover, the catogories are have a great relationship, online cources, and be on the best local websites. Did you know about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a successful life with online-dating. There's tons of people who struggle with relationships. For example, one day my mom and dad got into a series of arguments. She felt that the relationship wasn't good enough and she needed to meet a better man. On the other hand, she decided to live a better life and find dates (over the computer) and live a new life. These are the fantastic things you can do on the computer to have a better relationship. Your a highschool dropout because you cant keep up with the class. You dont turn in your homework and fail every test. Also, you feel that there is nothing you can do to fix it. Well not so fast my son! Now you can take online cources to boost up your grade and make you feel comfortable. Imagine sitting at the computer, completing every assignment and doing every homework there is. Watching your teacher teach, to you through a webcam. There's nothing like it, in fact you get the homework faxed to you. Someone in this world is living this life, it could be you. There's new websites all around the world today. However, there is no better website with all your friends on it. For example, myspace, facebook, and twitter. All websites that can stay in contact with your best friends. Another, that can be even more intrested is webcam. It's live from home fotage face to face on the computer. How cool is seeing your friend when your not together? Third of all, communication makes the world go around that why more and more people meet new friends. In sum, as you can see there's a lot of fun things you can do on a computer. It affects humans lives because more and more people are intrested in this device and the opportunities it provides.
1309	1313	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 waste your time learning at home when thats what schools for? People are concerned that too many people are spending too much time on their computers. They spend less time outdoors, excersising, and enjoying nature! People need more time to interact with their family. People are concerned. They are concerned there is way too much computer time. One time my mom had just bought a new computer and I stayed up all night on the internet. When I woke up the morning I was so tired and I didnt want to go to school. I think you should consider less computer time. The more time people use their computers the less time they are enjoying the outdoors. Insted of talking to you on myspace that they right down the street at the park with them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in @CAPS2 that use alot of computer time. Interacting is a nice enjoy nature and have fun. Family activities is a nice, fun and enjoyable way to spend your time. You can go to park when its nice outdoor weather, go swimming, play sports, in the wintertime you can possibly go to the movies, go to the mall, have fun with the family dont waste your time on the internet. In conclusion, there is too much computer time and you as the newspaper editor I advise you to make computers more expensive so people can spend their money on something more usefull because there is too much computer time. My mom says that ""more people use there computers, more that they put their feet in their shoes and walk outside!"" @CAPS3 people in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 think the same. Please consider my opinions the right way. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter."
1310	1314	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever trully marveles at the computers in our generation today? Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someonehas? Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children. In order to help the wee-being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours! This pretty much takes up a lot of time, so families can't spend time with one another. One important problem that children and teens face are @CAPS2 oover the intenet are people known as ""child predators."" @CAPS4 people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter @CAPS4 ""child predators; would you want to see your child be hurt by @CAPS4 horrible people? Computers are the reason, a with the internet for @CAPS4 accurances. Children and teens need to be protected from this major threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and thier lives. First, they don't allow people to be active and go outside, and they also create risks for our children and weaken our family bonds."
1311	1315	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 this ever happend to you? ""@PERSON3, did you do your research?"" ""@CAPS3, my computer crashed."" ""@PERSON1 did you practice typing @TIME1."" "" @CAPS3, my computer crashed."" "" @CAPS5, why weren't you online @TIME1? I really needed that sales report!"" ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, my computer crashed."" @CAPS6 it @CAPS2, you have realized that computers do benefit people. Whether its doing a class project, practicing for a computers class or exchanging buisness ideas, computers are a big help to society. First of all computers are a big help when it comes to a computer class at your school. There might be a certain speed that a person types and to pass the class, and the teacher could assign practice on your own home computer. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have some kind of personal ocmputer at home get @CAPS7 A's in their computer class. I can back that up as well. In my computers class. our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a little higher. Every @TIME1 I would practice but one @TIME1 my computer crashed, and I could not practice for the whole work with my luch the final exam @CAPS2 on @DATE1 instead of getting a @CAPS8 or A, I got a @CAPS9+. I blame that grade on not having a computer at home. Secondly, computer can be used for learning @MONTH1 different things as well. Maybe on a class report you needed to write something about the traditons of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Instead of running over to the library and wasting your time with a book. You could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet. Not only does it make for less time, but @CAPS6 you look it up on the internet, you will get way more search results than @CAPS6 you search on a library derectory. In addition, by using computers, you can look up the cutomers of a foreign country, or look up programs than could help you learn a new language on computers, you can not only learn about your own country but you can learn about foreign ones. Thirdly, computers can enchance many skills that are needed in the modern buisness word, such as socialization skills communication skills, and even learning about the younger generation. @CAPS6 someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program. They would not make it in the world of today. The people need to learn to intract with each others, and solve problems. @CAPS6 someone is not used intracting with people, they @MONTH1 not make a good buisness man or woman. People must be able to communicate as well @CAPS6 people do not communicate with each other. We will all end up dies in the headlights. We will al be lost and will be able to run buisnesses, or hold meetings, for example I needed to plan at adore for my project group to work on a project, and so I went on my computer hoping they were online basically they never showed and so I could not work with my partners at all. I ended up doing all their work. In conclusion I hope you have absolutely coundered my opinion about the computers have on people like I said, computers can be helpful @CAPS6 comes to computer classes, researching foreigh affairs, and even communicating with others thanks again for even reading this letter."
1312	1316	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Those who do support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I, for one agree with them. Computers are wonderful devices that allow people of all ages to learn about the world and it's people. It allows people to talk to family members that live far away, freinds, or sometimes buisness associates. Technology.. also provides education. Don't you think socializing, and learning are two very important aspects of everyday people? Learning new things can only be interesting if you can actually see them. Books can be helpful defending on when it was made. Internet websites can gives you pictures uploads almost every week. Therefore you know where you want to book your next visit. Yes books can give you tons of information, but not as much as the thousands of websites there are out there right this minute. Want to learn how to speak spanish look it up, fast and easy on the internet. No need to look and look a hundreds of books just to get one little fact. Throughout everything you do in a day chatting with friends is a good way to relax and have fun. Whether it's a close friend or a co-worker. There are now several ways to talk to friends, phones, texting, instant messaging, and even video chat! Yes it @MONTH1 cause time away from family, but you can easily say goodbye to the friend and talk to them later. Finally learning is a huge deal with people today. Well with this, advanced technology we have found ways to educate students in a fun way. Websites that are colorful and fun can teach kids how to multiply and read. About @PERCENT1 of children are more attached to colorful objects than books with words in them. So to all parents and guardians computers arent all that bad, they're actually very good for learning and connecting with others.
1313	1317	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you love computers but fear that you or loved ones spend way to much time on them? If so, then maybe we should @CAPS1 something. Toomany people have issues with their vision due to starring at computers to long. Also, people miss out on other outdoor activities as well. Finally, if people are working off of computers for their job then there missing out on same of the other important things in life such as, interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or just simply spending time with their close ones. Now, are you for or against this descison of people getting ""hooked"" on computers? In my opinion people should be enjoying things and not spend most of their time on computers. Since people are so dependent on computers, sometimes working form one can hurt your vision. The bright white computer screen filled with all those e-mails can really affect your vision. I know my dad always gets headaches and his vision isn't the best thing when it comes to him working on a computer all day. Being indoors and on a computer all day long makes you really miss the outdoor activites that their are. Things such as sports, nature, riding a bike and many other activities are missed out because of being on a computer all day. Only fun and energized people get out and get active. Last but not least, @CAPS1 you enjoy spending time with the ones you love but seem to busy because your on the computer all day? If so then get up and go have fun! Take the wife and kids on a hike or go and ride a bike, its awesome excersise for you, family and friends and its actually fun! So, its now or never. @CAPS1 you want to be at home on a computer all day or @CAPS1 you want to be high energized and spending quality time with family and friends? Most impotantly @CAPS1 you want to be energized and healthy with no vision problems and stop those awful headaches? Well, without a if you get up and get active it will be the best decision you will make! So, get up, grab the kids and get going on your new and energized, pain free life and enjoy the world around you."
1314	1318	1	3	Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing for everyone to have.
1315	1319	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to @CAPS2.com and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in @LOCATION1 then all this @CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'@CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'@CAPS3 do none of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people of all ages.
1316	1320	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a majority of the @ORGANIZATION1 population will use any type of computer at least once a day. Our society has been around computers so often that some people will find it hard to even live without them. Computers have become something that people depend on. This, however, is something to take as a concern. When people are dependent on computers too much, they lose valuable skills that they once possessed and they spend less time outside exercising while also losing touch with family and friends. It has become clear that computers have become a long part of people's lives. Computers possess the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place. We used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics. Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it. Today, however, people use technology to find this information. You @MONTH1 be thinking, ""@CAPS3, how is this a bad thing?"". The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to lose the ability to use books like encyclopedias and atlases or even simple maps. Once, most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from experience, that I can barely look at a map and find where I am. We have become too dependent on @CAPS4's and computers, which in turn makes us forget valuable information. What would happen if someone got lost and they didn't have a working @CAPS4 or signal on their phones. They would get lost and not know how to read a map. As you can see the human population has become too dependent on computers. Additionally, people all around the world have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, @CAPS6 and even @CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with. When people begin to spend the majority of their time on these websites, they will in turn get less exercise, and become more distant from family and friends. Mostly teenagers have this problem. If you took a survey of the number of students who have a facebook account or @CAPS6, you would probably get the majority. Having an account like this is said to be addicting. Students, parents and everyone in between will find troubles later on because of this. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any exercise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing it is now, I bet you there would be less overweight people. But not only do people become overweight, they will end up more and more distant from family and friends. My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. Once, the only way for us to really talk to her was through facebook. As you can see, computers can be a dangerous thing. Think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably think of quite a few. Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less exercising and less communication which is proven to support a healthy life style. Also when people use computers too much, they lose valuable skills. Remember this next time you or someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them by encouraging more balanced habits."
1317	1321	1	3	"Dear newspaper readers, @CAPS1 this! Sitting at home on the couch eating a bag of potato chips. The @CAPS2 shows a beautiful picture of the @LOCATION1 you can almost feel the rain falling on you, you really want to learn more about it. All of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it. On top of that, you remember you were supposed to meet your sister today who you haven't seen for years but you can't! If you had a computer you would be able to learn about more places and people, it would improve your hand eye coordination, and you could interact with people without having time to meet them! Computers definitely have good effects on people! First, computers help to improve hand-eye coordination. It is a fact that people who own one or more computers in a household have better hand-eye coordination than people without computers! Don't you want good hand-eye coordination too? As a matter of fact, my friend @PERSON4 had the worst hand-eye coordination in our school, now that her parents have bought her a computer, she is a lot quicker and definitely has better hand-eye coordination. She said that just looking at the screen and using the mouse helped a lot. Also, computer time can states that computers have been proven to improve hand-eye coordination in the course of a year. That sounds pretty simple to me! Next, computers also allow people to learn about other faraway places and people. Local middle school teacher, @PERSON2, uses computers to teach her students about the @CAPS3 culture and geography. That sounds a lot more interesting than just talking! My cousins saw an article about @LOCATION3 once and they thought it was amazing they learned a lot about the culture there and actually took a trip there! Furthermore, vacations.com says that computers are the #@NUM1 cause of people traveling, because they see pictures and articles about places. You can learn about any place you want on a computer, doesn't that sound nice? I'm sure there is one place you've always wanted to learn about! Finally, computer allow people to interact with other people around the world You can talk with your long lost friend who lives in @LOCATION2 just by the click of the mouse. In a recent study, over @PERCENT1 of people just talk online to their friends rather than going out to meet them. How convenient! Also, expert computer teacher, @PERSON1, says, ""Computers are great if you can't meet someone, you just talk online"". Have you ever needed to cancel a meeting? Computer are really beneficial to busy people. Now readers, @CAPS1, your sitting on that same couch you look at the @CAPS2 to see @LOCATION1, you quickly type it into your laptop and an article appears right in front of you read more about it learning something new in every paragraph. All of a sudden you lose your grip, but you catch your laptop just in time, what hand-eye coordination! Then you remember you were supposed to meet you sister @PERSON3, but you have a hair appointment. You quickly tell her via computer you cant meet her. She says it's alright and you guys keep chatting it all worked out! It's so simple! Computers teach hand-eye coordination, let you learn about more places, and interact with more people. So what are you doing readers? Get out there and get a computer and start enjoying these benefits for yourself."
1318	1322	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 your computer can help you physically? Many parents state that, ""@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye coordination. Parents argue that kids weigh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do certain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only going on certain games, limiting their time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a very important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you aren't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what you need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benefit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one area? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. The internet helps us keep in touch with relatives friends and even helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me keep in touch with old friends from different cities. In conclusion, computers offer significant benefits for coordination, education, and communication when used responsibly."
1319	1323	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1-@ORGANIZATION1 Computers... they are sometimes bad and sometimes good they're like people. Computers are helpful on finding information, making your work less difficult. But at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family. Computers have so much information that the news paper in the future will no longer be known. Newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch. Because of computers instead of getting info of what happen yesterday in what area you live with the computer you can find out what interesting things happen yesterday in the whole world. But thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project about, as an example, cells and with that computer it will help a lot more than you think no need to write all sloppy just type, find pictures of cells which you can find in the internet, print done it just makes life way easier than just writing drawing finding info of cells in book that waste good time to go outside and play with friends and family. Computer like I said are sometimes bad like people and it also like a drug. Because look at computers when people go on website like, myspace, twitter, facebook, communicating website or game website, there's way to much to name. Its a drug cause you to stay on it day to night you'll get stuck to it and can't get enough of it and some people won't stop and it hurts there family, friend and especially health, like drugs they cause all the same thing. I think I proved my point of why computers are sometimes bad and sometimes good like people, and it is up to us to use them wisely for our benefit.
1320	1324	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think people using a computer has a effect. Using a computer can help people in many ways. You can talk to people world wide, it helps you stay organized, and you can create very useful things like a or a power point using a computer. Talking to people world wide can be a very useful thing. Say that you have family members that live in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 you can keep in touch with them by e-mail or video chat. Also, if there is a national leader and needs to talk to the other governors around the world for advice or help he can do that quickly and easily. Using a computer can also help you stay organized. For example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the right places. Imagine all of the papers and space he would use if he had to do by hand or didn't use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e-mail parents, and even create test or quizes and they know it will be nice and organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desk. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make a lot of other things like power points. Power points can help them put a lot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising. Lastly, you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday for a lot of different people. Talking to people worldwide can help you stay in touch, so you don't lose connection with your family. They also have effect they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them? It certainly shows how integrated they are in our daily tasks.
1321	1325	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, The debate surrounding @ORGANIZATION1 has been a topic of discussion around the @LOCATION1 for decades now. People cannot agree on whether computers are a good privilege to society or just bringing it down year after year. I think computers do have a positive effect on people. This is because they teach hand-eye coordination, give them knowledge about cultures around the world, and allow people to communicate with one another. Do you think the downsides really outweigh these positives? Hand-eye coordination is not something you are born with. You gain it as you get older and achieve practice. Computers help with this goal. ""@PERCENT1 of people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 frequently, have been horrible at catching a baseball before going on the @ORGANIZATION1, and after have caught every time,"" says biologist @PERSON1. And it not only helps with baseball, but with other sports such as juggling, golf, or tennis. If you get very good at these sports, you can play them for fun, or even as a professional. Who knew that playing on the @ORGANIZATION1 could get you so far in life?! Did you know, according to ""Time"" magazine, that people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 are better able to focus on tasks, such as schoolwork, because it enables your hands and eyes to work together as one? And everyone knows that if you get good grades in school, almost any job you could be qualified for? Then, you can earn a good amount of money, and live your dream life!! Oh, great another @NUM1 hour day of school. Hhmm. What do I have first block? @LOCATION3 history. What? Yes! We're doing a culture project! That means I can easily go on the @ORGANIZATION1 and find out great things about what place I'm assigned. That's another up-put about computers. Easy access to tons of useful information. I have cheerleading every day after school until @NUM2. If I have a project, I don't have hours and hours to look in books and find out what I need to know. Computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school. @PERCENT2 of people use computers to do their informational work about faraway places. It is faster and more accurate. You could just search through your bookshelf to find an almanac. But once you find it, you would need to check the copyright. Hopefully it's recent. If not, you're in trouble. Would you feel like prying through more shelves to be accurate? Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2. All new ways to communicate with people. Just another useful effect on people. Forgot to write down your homework? Hopefully your friend didn't and you can just ask them. ""@PERCENT3 of people don't chat with others online,"" says @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 expert. Most of it has to be for some reason or another, such as homework, what happened that day, or how they haven't seen each other in forever. Don't you chat with people online? Trust me, it can be a grade-saver. Maybe this will help you conclude that computers give a positive effect on society because of hand-eye coordination, information, and chatting. What would we do without them?"
1322	1326	1	3	"Dear trained readers, @CAPS1't you agree that more and more people use computers? Well I @CAPS2 because it gives us the information we want to see. Recently it has been brought to my attention that some people agree that some people @CAPS3 themselves don't really use computers. Without a doubt I firmly believe that people that don't use computers should start to use them, but I can understand why some people don't use computers. Maybe they don't know how to use one, have better things to @CAPS2, or can't afford one. First of @CAPS5, they don't know how to use one. I remember when my friend was over and I was on a computer, and he @CAPS4 ""@CAPS2 you know that some people don't know how to use a computer?"" And I @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 who?"" He @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 me, I don't know how to use one."" I @CAPS4 well I'll teach you. Since then @CAPS5 my friend does is go on the computer. One day he says to me because of that he wants to work with computers. This is one of my reasons why people don't use computers. Second of @CAPS5, have better things to @CAPS2. In @MONTH1 maybe someone has a game. For example, I mostly have no time to go on the computer. Usually I have a basketball game or practice. I get home from practice and feel exhausted, @CAPS5 all I want to @CAPS2 is go to @CAPS6. Why parents come home have not wanting to @CAPS2 anything? I'll tell you why. Because @CAPS5 that have, they @CAPS2 @CAPS5 day. This is another one of my reasons why people don't use computers. Third of @CAPS5, can't afford one. Some people don't have a lot of money to buy a computer. They have to save it so they can live in a house. When parent's children ask for something parents shouldn't buy it, but they buy it so you don't feel hurt. When I'm a @CAPS7 I'm going to make sure I have enough money to buy it. If not then I guess that child is out of luck. So don't be going around bragging about your computer because some can't afford one. This is my last reason why people don't use computers. This is why some people don't use computers now in days: because they don't know how to use one, have something better to @CAPS2, and can't afford one. By the way; @PERCENT1 of the pupils of @ORGANIZATION1 don't have computers."
1323	1327	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my opinion on computers' benefit to society. I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today overuse that power. You know what I mean, @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts. Or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. People like the @CAPS4 do not spend much time with family members, or friends, or even just outside. They do not get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, physically or socially. Some people are working all day, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so that they rarely spend time with those they love. But if you are hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @MONTH1 just not spend enough time with family and friends. Using a computer isn't exactly a social thing; it's one person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. You @MONTH1 say ""@CAPS5, but there are also online social networks."" @CAPS5, but how often do you even see those people in real life? Computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. That certainly does not benefit society. A major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors. So you cannot be online chatting, or playing a game, or checking your email, outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. Sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors? Computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not well. That is the reason why pine trees don't have outlets, although now you never know what they'll do next. Another side effect - that goes along with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise. Once again, it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. When you live as a computer vegetable, you're not getting enough exercise as you could or would be. Another reason computers could lower your quality of life. Now, really, if you use the computer sparingly, and only when you needed to, or when it is necessary, you would really have none of these ""side effects."" But face it, the truth is, computers can be addicting. Whether it's waiting for a friend to come online or you're trying to get to level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"", they can get you hooked. The idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers, but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting - sparingly. So, now you know, computers when used too much, at obsessive amounts, are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting. As long as you use them correctly, they are a very, very valuable tool to be used, but overused, can be problem causing, and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends, getting exercise and even spending time outdoors. I know you certainly will agree."
1324	1328	1	3	I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you can communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you can communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They talk to my grandparents, their friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. I use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscriptions and other things to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are a lot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. There are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like Facebook or Myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or make dining reservations. For example, me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel during vacation, and probably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side, life without computers. If we didn't have computers we would have to send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have a new baby. Plus we would also end up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents' life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of America uses them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then there's the always helpful planning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel or dinner at a restaurant. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned way, where you add up and subtract and divide. It's a lot less work if you use a computer.
1325	1329	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe computers don't benefit society. I feel this way because of the lack of social skills, no exercising, and it's addicting. Read on for further explaining. Firstly, spending hours and hours on the computer gives you no social skills whatsoever. You could think before you reply and most people online talk or write way differently there than in person. People could act like someone else. Online you could erase what you wrote but in person you can't. That's why you simply can't gain social skills spending all this time talking online. Next, you get no exercise. On a nice beautiful @DATE1 you'll be inside on the computer when you could be getting exercise. Being online sitting down doing nothing just talking makes you lazy. When you're older you'll have to be writing, you can't just spend all these long hours on the computer. Furthermore, you should have your time for on the computer and for exercising. Finally, it's addicting; some people could spend hours and hours on the computer looking up all these videos. Seven out of ten teenagers would rather be inside on the computer talking to people rather than meeting new people elsewhere. I think parents should restrict their children's time to be on computers. All this time with this fun could be spent doing studying or something to help you out in the future. In conclusion, I believe computers don't benefit society. I feel this way because of the lack of social skills, no exercise, and it being addicting. I think some people should limit their time on the computer and expand their time doing something important.
1326	1330	1	3	Dear editor of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you know @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION3 own computers! Could you imagine a life without them? Computer do benifit society. I cant even remember the last time I went a day without a computer. All of this talk about computer being bad for society really got thinking. There is no way possible that computers are bad. for example computers are good for motor skills and what about school work computers help a lot when you forget your homework log at school and lastly sociability! I don't know about you but I couldn't live without computers! Computers teach hand-eye coordination! which we all know we need to play sports! Also with all the typing you do there is definatly some exercise for your wrists! I should know that they do because I woke both my wrists, at the same time and when I went to rehab they told me I should try getting my wrists back to normal by typing and having of calcium but that's another story. Computers are also great for school say that you forget your homework log at school so you don't know what you had for homework well you could call a friend but wouldn't adjust be easier to go online to the teachers webpage? teachers always have there homeworks listed on a school web page. And no you realize you forgot your mathbook to! have no fear the online textbook is here! and thats a lot easier then going back to the school to get it! don't you think? Lastly when you have a big project you can do research on anything and everything in the world! from ants to @LOCATION2 its all there. Here's a big benifit to society for you on all of the social networking sites such as facebook myspace and so man more arn't you able to leave comments on friends profiles or even chat with them! Which brings me to tm my next topics chatting on the computer! There is @CAPS2 and like I said before you can even chat on social networking sites. And lets say that you arn't able to watch the news cant you go online and check that to! There are so many social things to do on the computer and those are just some. So I hope those @PERCENT1 of people and even people that don't own computers are on my side. So we can prove that computers are good for motor skills, school work and even social networking. So please be on my side so we can show the public that computers are social and beneficial for everyone.
1327	1331	1	3	Computers were built to help the people make tasks easier and quicker. Since then, they have been updated over and over untill what they are today. Computers are a part of most peoples everydaylives, and essential to most bussiness.But the common question in our society is, are computers really benefitting us? My answer is yes. Computers do many things for us. They teach us hand-eye coordinatin, give us the ability to research effectivly, and recently, became a great way of communication, @CAPS1's are definately benefitting us. One reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination. In a magazine I read, one expect, (@PERSON1) said that leading to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes. The speed that you type is improved with practice. Another way it improves hand-eye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively. I often on being ammused by playing games on the computer. These games usually are hard, but with my improving hand-eye coordination, I am learning how to play these games well. My father always tells me to learn my way through a computer because they are our future, soon, mostly everything will be done by them with the improving technokolgy, it is impossible for it not to be benificial to our society. Our home computers have been great at teaching me thing like hand-eye coordination. Another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper, just a click away. My garndfather always tells me how easy I have it. Instead of going to the @CAPS2 and having to pick out a book, I just go to google and have an entire search engine infront of me. When we go into highschool we will need a computer to suceed. To keep our essays organized, our research effective, and the clear to read typing right infront of us. My brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made. Last year, we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster. This way very easy considering I typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate. Computers have changed the way we research and finish school works. The last reason why computers are fantastic is beacuse they make communication just a click away. A couple weeks ago, my coach emailed us that our gametime has changed. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but without his @CAPS1, we would've missed the game. My cousin @CAPS3 is from @LOCATION1. Me and him meet only once a year. With that limited time, we can't really get out what we need to. Recently, i bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week. It is almost like he's with me. All the girls in our school can't get enough of me. So I get home after sports, go on, and theres always enough of me to go around. Webcamming is a great way of communication. With all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop. Well, the question still lingere, are computers benificial to our society? The answer @MONTH1 never come about, but at least for me, improving hand-eye, researching being a breeze, and communication just waiting for me is a pretty sweet deal. So for now, I stand by the opinion that computers are great, and extremely useful to everyone in our modern world.
1328	1332	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. Computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons. One computers let you surf online anytime you want. Two, computers allow people talk online. First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. This is very convenient. What if you live far away from the nearest library? When you have to write a research paper? Jane lives @NUM1 miles away from her town library. Her mother could drive her ther, but what if she wasn't at home or driving someone else to a doctor's appointment? This is when computers come in handy. Jane can just simply go online and do the research! Not only that but also, ""www.internetsocool.gov"" states that information you can find in a regular library is about @NUM2 of information you can find online. Secondly, computers let you talk with people both faraway and nearby online and videochat. This is very useful for me. Since I live by myself in @LOCATION1, I miss my family a lot. Although with internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want! Also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" also states in his book that over @NUM3 million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes. In conclusion, ivideochat @MONTH1 sound like something to do for lark, but it is actually used for many good purposes. On the other hand, some people say that computers are bad. Some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family. Although, ""The @DATE1 survey of what people do,"" states that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally. Just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family. In conclusion in our culture because are very crucial in our culture because it can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live faraway, making the world a smaller and more connected place."
1329	1333	1	3	Do you think computers are handy? I do believe they are very handy. Computers offer many things like Online shopping, @CAPS1 and even @CAPS2.V. Online shopping can be very helpful. Say you doní@CAPS2 have a car. Well you can go online and buy whatever you need at the store. People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games. You can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping. That is why I think computers are helpful. Chatting on the computer is great. Now facebook, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate the @CAPS15. On @CAPS6 you can follow famous people like @PERSON1 the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receicer. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people accounts. Chatting become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. you @MONTH1 believe its pointless but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer. This is also easier when maybe your in the car for a long road trip then you turn on your laptop and watch any show you @MONTH1 went @CAPS17 on the go is technology at its higher point. Thats why computers are so convienient. So now you have read how helpful, how its a neccessity, and the computer is convienient. Now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the @CAPS15 to see for yourself.
1330	1334	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an amazing piece of technology, but some people are beginning to abuse the @CAPS2. There are many benefits to having a computer. In my opinion I think that computers help people out a lot such as looking up directions or even chatting with some old friends. But many People are abusing the @CAPS2 and not @CAPS1 when to get off. The @CAPS2 is a very fun thing to be on but when your on it for too long, you miss out on family acvivitys, hanging out with friends etc. I think that there should be a time limit for everyone on the computer. If we had something that would shut off othe computer but save everything you were doing, People would go out more and be more active. Eventhough people @MONTH1 be learning about things on the computer, you have to know when to get off. Now on the @CAPS2 there are websites where you can watch exercize videos or if you even want to buy some exercize equiptment etc. The @CAPS2 can be a pretty handy thing but you dont want to be on it for long periods of time. I believe that having a computer can be a very cool thing to have and very useful when you need it. But there should be time limits for how long people stay on the computer to ensure a healthy and active lifestyle for everyone.
1331	1335	1	3	Dear Local news paper @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, I'am part of the middle community. I read in the local newspaper that lots of people use computers and that not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In @CAPS1 opinion this benefits society in many ways because you get to work anywere you want, you could connect with family, and because it gives you the ability to learn about other places and people. You can get to work anywere because now in this days a cellphone, and ipod's come's with internet and with many things that you need to work that you have in a computer, allowing for remote tasks to be completed from a park or a cafe. We also have the laptop's that are easy to take anywere. You also got many programs on a computer to connect with family on others states or city's as in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @LOCATION1, making distances feel much smaller. Last, it also gives you the abiity of learning about other places, and people by photos, information, and websites, which broadens your understanding of the world. Like when it says the trategies that had happened in other states like the one that happened in @LOCATION4, you can learn about them instantly. This is @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benefit for society. Thanks for reading them and have a nice day.
1332	1336	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, A question that recently came to my attention is people are spending to much time on the computer, and if this is a good thing, I believe that computers are a good electronic item to have. I think this because, it helps people learn. Also, people can keep in touch with their friends even if they I've in a different country. In addition, it can help people or students be more organized; @CAPS1 please consider this in our newspaper. Would you like students/people to have internet and searches that can help them learn? The answer is ""yes"". Having to computers can help students to learn. They can go onto @LOCATION2 and type in any question they want to be answered. Picture this a child has a question that she wants answered, but she is embarrased to ask her parents. She can simply type the question in on her computer and get hundreds of answers. There is nobody in the world that knows everything, but there are computers that do. Computers can give you the answer to any question. When my mom was little she didn't have access to a computer all the time. @CAPS1 when she had a question she would have to ask somebody she know. If they didn't know the answer than she couldn't know the answer. If more people had computers then they would find the answers to questions. Computers are a good way to keep in touch with people. These are @CAPS4 programs such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, aim, ect.. My dad owns a buisness and needs to be in touch with people for seven @CAPS1 he carries around his iphone to talk to them by email. It helps my dad know when pappers are due and whos asking questions on what. I asked ten adults if they think everyone should have to a computer and ten out of ten said ""yes."" @CAPS4 people think that friends and family are important and should stay with them every once and a while. I have a friend who lives in @LOCATION1, but I cant contact her with my phone because are plan doesnt allow it; me and her talk on @CAPS2 all the time. @CAPS1 if people dont own phones then you can still stay in contact with computers, especially if they live far away. Do you have perfect handwriting? The answer is probably no. People use @ORGANIZATION1 all the time because there handwriting isn't very neat. Computers help people stay clean and tidy. Computers have lots of folders and programs to store information you need. This all stays organized right on the computer. My friend just got a computer for her office. Before she got it one had to write everything and kep them all on her desk in a mess. She had drawers filled with pappers. But after she got a computer she typed everything neatly and kept all her pappers in the folders of her computer. She was @CAPS1 so neat and clean that she got promoted. My friends moms habits changed because she got a computer. She became more organized and cleaner. Picture this you are overwhelmed by all the papers on your desk. You dont know what papper is what. Well if you had a computer you could type eerything and keep them in your computer files. also @PERCENT1 of adults think staying organized is good. I know you the local newspaper, have a very hard job and decision to make. I beileve that computers are good and helpful. Because they can help people find information they need. Also, they can keep people in touch with buisness workers, friend, students, family, ect. In addition, computers can help people get neat and clean. @CAPS1 please consider puting my essay in the Newspaper."
1333	1337	1	3	Are people today spending to much time on computers. If so how had done it affect thous. In our modern day people spend to much time on computers. Both me and my friends think that this is affecting people in many different ways. Some ways it affects you are by your Health, your social life, and also your education. Spending to much time on a pc can effect your health in many ways. For example exercise. The people spend all there time siting in a chair they could have a chance of gaining wait. Then you might not be getting all the nutrients you need because your on the computer you might not go to the store to get the fruits and veggies. Your want to just stay home so you can use the computer. Social life @CAPS1, you could have less interaction with all the people you know; you are also will ignore them. Another big problem is education. Is you are all day on the computer you might not do anything for school @CAPS2 you think it's not important if it's not on the computer you might neglect your homework. Those are some of the resons why I think people shouldn't spend to much time on the computer, as it can harm their overall well-being.
1334	1338	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have a positive affect on people because they help students as well as many others study, they allow you to access stores by shopping online and computers allow people to communicate. After reading this letter, I assure you that you will agree with me. The first reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because they help students as well as many other people study. If you have a test or quiz in @CAPS1, you can go on your computer and print out @CAPS1 practice sheets. Or if you have a vocabulary exam you can find the definitions fast and easy on the computer. In the times of @ORGANIZATION1, a statistic shows that @PERCENT2 of students in the @ORGANIZATION2 find computers there best studying tool. They find it affective and fast to use. Last night, I had a test on the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I went online, typed in ""The @CAPS3 @CAPS4"", and found @MONTH1 helpful cites on it. It was useful and did not waste my time. Using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier but their is on even greater one. Secondly, computers have a positive affect on people because it saves people time by shopping online. So many stores now allow you to purchase stock on me. it is easy and convenient with a click of a button and saves you time driving to the stores. In @ORGANIZATION1, it showez that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 across the @ORGANIZATION2 said shopping online improved their lives by making it less hectic from driving from store to store. Shopping online creates a positive, less hectic life for many people around the world. Online shopping having a positive affect on people by making their lives less busy is a great reason but there is one last even greater one. The last most important reason why computers have a positive impact on people is because it allows people to communicate with each other. Communication through computers are extremely powiar. With instant messaging or email of even blackboard, a new teacher-student communication site, computers are often being used for communication. i surveyed @NUM1 kids and @NUM2 said that computers are there main source of communication. Communication through computers it has a positive affect on people in many ways like to communicate easier for work, to talk to your best friend on e-mail who just moved to @LOCATION2, or to simply send out invitations for a party to all your friends. Computers have made life easier for many through communication, making a positive effect on them. This is why communication having a positive affect on people is the most important reason. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people because it allows them to study easier, saves people time by shopping online, and allows people to communicate. With all the ways computers help us there is no reason why they would negatively affect us. I know that you will take this into cons ideration. Computers are making our lives easier day by day and who knows what they will be able to do in the future to help us even more."
1335	1339	1	3	"would you rather read six books to get that one recipie, or would you rather look it up in less than ten minutes? I think computers have an positive effect on people you can learn about places you want you need in minutes and you can talk to your friends inline Computers have a good effect on people because, you can learn about places you want to wish this @DATE1. For example, @PERSON5 wanted to wish @LOCATION2 this @DATE1 but when he looked online he saw how @LOCATION2 just had an earthquake so he changed his plans this @DATE1. @CAPS1, @PERSON2 said ""I wanted to go to @LOCATION3 this @DATE1 but I didn't know much about it, so I searched on google and figure thatb this @DATE1 I will go to @LOCATION3"" that is one positive thing computers effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit in the @DATE1. Computers have a positive effect on people because you can @CAPS1 find what you need in minutes. For example. @PERSON3 was looking for a cake recipie, he was looking many cook books but didn't find it, so he took thru his labtop and found it in under five minutes, @CAPS1, computer experts @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2 of rooming thru books and books for information you nead why not go to the computer and search; truxt me its much faster"" @CAPS3, computers have a good effect on people because you can talk to your friends online, for example, @PERSON6 said ""I moved from @CAPS4 to @LOCATION1 and I was sad to leave my bestfriend but now I can talk to her on @CAPS5."" @CAPS1, @PERSON4 was in bed sick and coudnt go ourside to visit his friends so he kelf intouch with them on @CAPS7. Computers have a positive effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit this @DATE1. You can find what you need in minutes, and you can talk to your friends online just remember even computer report @PERSON1 said ""truxt me its much easier"" to use a computer for these tasks."
1336	1340	1	3	Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles, seamlessly integrating into daily routines. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain, providing a gateway to global knowledge. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone, bridging distances effortlessly. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing, streamlining the entire process. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world with just a few clicks. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on recent global events and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years, uncovering niche information. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics sometimes think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite by facilitating connection. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people, making conversations more personal. It's just like youre right there with them. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone, removing financial barriers. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly, producing clean documents. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work, catching common errors. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want, offering great flexibility. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news, keeping them connected. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts, aiding in education and work. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers and appreciate their role in modern life.
1337	1341	1	3	Today, wherever you go, there is technology being used, integrated into various aspects of life. The most common, computers are widely used by a majority of people, but are computers really beneficial to society? Computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world, a way to increase responsibility, and helpful for education. Computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world in profound ways. You can use a computer to find anything that is on the web, so you can find information about places that interest you or places that you would like to visit, planning trips with ease. According to recent studies, a significant number of people check the internet for places to visit before they actually go. Furthermore, it is a way to connect with faraway friends, maintaining relationships across distances. One of my friends moved to another state when we were in fifth grade, but we still e-mail each other, and are still friends thanks to this technology. The computer is also one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events as they unfold. All you have to do is go to a news website for instant updates. All of these connections will widen people's views of the world, fostering a global perspective. Computers are a way to increase responsibility, too, by presenting users with choices. When the people use the computer, there are many choices that they have to make, like what websites to go to and what to download or watch, requiring discernment. Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is, promoting critical thinking. Even if you choose the wrong choice, you will learn from your mistake, which is a valuable lesson. Second, the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of care to handle properly. For example, you can't have any liquid nearby and must not throw objects near or on the computer, teaching users to be mindful. Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility and respect for property. Lastly, computers are beneficial because they help education in numerous ways. Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting and engaging for students. For example, they can create interactive points and presentation to provide a visual aid, reinforcing what they learned at school. Additionally, you can make online portals for the students, which provide them with their homework and information about the classes conveniently. One of my friends once said that without the computer for research, he would definitely be failing his classes. Nobody wants to struggle, and a computer is a great way to present information clearly. Lastly, if you want information on a particular school, you can just search it online and find its website quickly. School websites have information about classes, events, and clubs, offering a comprehensive view. They provide the information that you need to think about going to that school in an easy, convenient way, while finding the website for the school take no more than a few minutes, actually going to that school for information can take more than just a few minutes, and even hours, saving valuable time. According to educational surveys, many students choose what college to go to first by checking its website online. The computer is an easy, convenient way to get information, democratizing access. Now, no one should be doubting the benefits of a computer. They are a connection to the world, like places, and people, enriching our understanding. They increase responsibility by giving you many choices to navigate. They help education by providing information about and for schools, enhancing learning. This is why computers are beneficial to the society we live in today.
1338	1342	1	3	Do you think people spend to much time on the computer? I think that kids and adults spend to much time on social media platforms, twitering, doing facebook and myspace, often at the expense of other activities. My resons include, people should go outside more, and play with real people, and spend time with family, which are crucial for development. Most kids should go out side more for fresh air and exercise; for example my friend spent several hours a day on his computer and haven went outside, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. Another example is my neghbor who spent all day in his basement playing on his computer and haven went outside and since he hevet went outside he is terreibely afraid of the sun and he is now ten years old an dhe still dont go outside it was because he spent to much time on the computer, showing the long-term effects. Secondly, people should play with real people to develop social skills. For example there was a kid who allways played with vertual people an dfrends and never realy pleople and now he is so shy around real people that he wont even say one word, highlighting the impact on communication. Another example is a boy who only had vertual frend and never a real one and he is so depress becose he never had a best frend, demonstrating the emotional consequences. Thirdly you should spend time with your family to build strong bonds. there was a person who never spent time with his family becse he was to busy writing emails and experts says that kids who dont interact with them wont have the same benifits as kids who do, missing out on crucial support. Another example there was a family who were to bisy with the computer that the kids never met the grandparents and when the grand parents passed away the kids never met them becse they would rather play on there computers, a truly sad outcome. In conclution people should go outside more for physical health, play with real people for social health, and visit there family for emotional health; then if you want to play on your computer then after reading all of these examples then go ahead, but hopefully with a better sense of balance.
1339	1343	1	3	"Many people use computers in their daily lives, making them a common fixture. Some people agrees that it benefit the society and others disagree, leading to ongoing debate. Some experts think people are spending too much time on the computers, and less time exercising, playing outside, and having family time, expressing valid concerns. I think differently, computers help us with hand-eye coordination for jobs, stay in touch with family members and friends, and computers also help us learn about different things, offering significant advantages. Computers help us with many things but the most important is jobs and career preparation. Many jobs use computers for various tasks and communication. In order to get a job using computers you need hand-eye coordination which computers teach us through regular use. Computers prepare us with skills we are going to need when we get jobs, making us more employable. Computers are very helpful in this regard. Computers also help us stay in touch with our family members and friends, no matter the distance. A resident of a small town says that if we didn't have computers she wouldn't have been able to see her neice and nephew open their christmas presents she got them, sharing a special moment. She also wouldn't have seen her nephew take his first steps, a milestone event. ""Technology is wonderful"" she explained to me, expressing her gratitude. She loves staying in touch with her families through computers, which strengthens their bonds. Computers are also help young children to old adults learn new things, acting as a vast educational resource. Computers hold a lot of information, many people learn things they have never heard of on the internet, expanding their knowledge. My younger sister learned how to read on the computer using educational programs. She is now in the highest reading level you can be in, in first grade, showing clear progress. Computers are very helpful at learning new things and acquiring skills. Computers can do many things, they help us with getting jobs by teaching us hand-eye coordination and other necessary skills. They can also help us keep in touch with our loved ones, maintaining important relationships. Computers teach us about interesting things like faraway places and people, broadening our horizons. Computers are a wonderful thing to have in our society, providing numerous benefits. Experts, their is no reason whats so ever you should be concerned with more and more people using computers, it's a good thing that enhances our lives in many ways."
1340	1344	1	3	In the world we live in now, everything is getting technilogical, transforming how we operate. In my own opinion, its a good thing that brings numerous advantages. Using computers has been very helpful to our society, impacting various sectors. They give people the opportunity to research things fast and easily, they save trees, and they're a wonderful way to communicate with people, covering key areas of benefit. First, computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste tree and other resources. A few years ago, kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library, requiring physical effort. But, nowadays it's computers that are the first stop. Sure, of course books are very helpful, but so is the internet, plus its much faster and easier to find to find the information you're looking for, saving time. You can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away that you may never see. It really is magical how much knowledge is available. Next, using computers saves trees and helps the environment significantly. With a computer we don't have to keep cutting down so many trees for books and paper, reducing our ecological footprint. Another author can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right on their devices, increasing accessibility. Honestly, there really is no reason to keep making physical books for every purpose. Even students can do their home work, test and quizzes online, embracing digital education! I think it's a mirical and it's so amazing to see how much our world has changed in only about twenty years, showing rapid progress. Finally, computers are great to communicate with people far away, closing the distance. Some people have family in the war who they don't see for months or maybe years, making communication vital. With a computer you can get emails that get deliveres to the person right after being sent, providing instant updates. Or you can even webcam and actually see the person face to face, making interactions more personal! It must be hard not being able to see your loved ones everyday, which is why a computer is very helpful for maintaining connections. Even to those who have a family member away on a business trip or that live in another state/country, computers offer a lifeline. Computers are very helpful, especially today with everything going on in our world, proving their value. With computers we can do online research efficiently, save trees by reducing paper use, and communicate with people far away effortlessly. So, in my opinion computers do benefit society and are a positive force for the future.
1341	1345	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I agree with the people that support advances in technology. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because they can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it can be educational. Many people believe computers are good for nothing. Even though they can be used for many things like research! For example, if you are a student you might need to do a project. Computers would be easier for you to collect research than a book, providing access to a vast amount of information quickly. Another reason why computers are educational is because you can use them to read. You can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer. Not only is that education but that also helps the environment because you would be saving paper. Sometimes you might simply be curious about something, your computer will be right there for you to use. Computers also have another positive effect on people, they can be used for communication. Nobody likes a distant family, but with a computer you can communicate with family and friends from all over the world! This effect is positive because it helps everyone stay in touch. Many people have very busy lives and don't have time to write a letter or make a phone call. So, instead those people could just quickly and easily send an email or instant message to whoever they need to talk to. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with both friends and family. These experts don't realize that you can use a computer to interact with friends and family. A computer enables many family activities. You can watch a movie as a family or play multiplayer games together on the computer. Entertainment on the computer is a positive effect because while doing activities on the computer as a family you would be in a safe environment, for example, using a computer to be entertained is safer than doing something entertaining outside where you and your family would be exposed to many dangers. There are various reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. Those are only my main reasons they are many more. And that is why I support advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people.
1342	1346	1	3	Dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are good to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in other places or with your family or friends or meet with people from other country and you can become friends. They are also good because they help to develop coordination of your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. First of all I think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other country or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. You can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls, using applications that allow for free video chats. Secondly the computers are helpful because they help you coordinate your hand and your eye. This helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; You will be able to finish it on time by improving your typing and navigation skills. From your point of view you can actually see where I'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. The hand coordination can help you develop mental sight and better reflexes. Thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy things like clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online from the comfort of your home. In conclusion I think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to coordinate body parts don't you agree with me?
1343	1347	1	3	Dear Editor, People are using computers all the time but computers help us all the time in positive ways. Computers help us look up information, talk to people around the world, and buy stuff from our house. In a technological age the possibilities are endless. I have a cousin in another state and I talk to him through webcam; there are more people than who talk to their relatives elsewhere actually almost every soldier talks to someone back home. Doctors even say that talking to someone back home gives a soldier more will power to survive. Everyone goes to school, so that means everyone has projects. During projects a kid wants to know everything so a good way to get information is to go on the computer and search what you're looking for. The computer has trillions of websites that people use. You can find anything from how man started to the latest news. Being a sports person and everyone likes to get music free online, there are websites like YouTube and Pandora so you can listen. If you like that song go on iTunes, Amazon, lymewire, or any other store to and download to your MP3 player or computer. In this time I hope you have learned more about the computer and have changed your mind. Even though there are bad people and bad websites doesn't mean the computer itself is bad.
1344	1348	1	3	Who would have thought computers can have an effect for people. People all over learn things on the computer each day. Of course everybody learns and reads new things because of the computer. There is even fun stuff to do on the computer. You can pick from many different music videos and music. And there are many ways to chat with people like over the phone on a cell phone. But there are computers too, there are many ways to communicate with friends/family. Also there is myspace, facebook and other sites. Those are websites that you can go on to talk to family/friends but there's other websites that you can go on. But I would also like to comment something about the computer. I understand the computer is lots of fun. Sometimes you need a break you can't stay on the computer all the time. You must remember that you need exercise too. You must go out and enjoy nature. You should take a walk or ride your bike. You must understand computers are good for learning but not for everyday life all the time. The computer is good for learning but you should also go out and get some fresh air.
1345	1349	1	3	To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously needed in society. They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself often use computers for many reasons. Our teachers also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research. For example, last week in social studies I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to a website on the internet and found a storage of information for my project on whether capital punishment is unusual. I found from this database that not only is it allowed for that reason but the state got a report from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which is instant and carries the newest, most recent information I would have had to go find books published recently enough to carry this significant fact. It would be more costly and taken over two hours just to find the same information that took five minutes using a computer. The internet can access millions of websites and photos on a wide variety of topics faster than any other method. As well as for research, schools use computers to type papers. This makes it easier for the teacher to read and provides useful tools like spell check. Also, using the internet you can access all of the communication benefits of using computers. E-mail, Skype, Facebook and Twitter are just a few of the commonly used websites on computers they make talking to friends and family easier and faster then ever. Last month my friend was on a business trip that was for two weeks she missed him a lot but her mom let her use the computer so she was able to talk to him, which would have been more expensive as a telephone call. It consoled her for the days she wasn't able to see him while still being amazingly quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer; mastering how to use the computer before it is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them we don't need to worry about learning later in life. Also in the closer future computers will be used in high school and college for helping with paper researching and more; it will be faster and easier for us if we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventually the benefits are countless. As you can see, computers and the internet can have many benefits in our society; schools can use them for many projects and learning. People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face to face; finally, it can help run the future. In conclusion computer use should be encouraged.
1346	1350	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being so popular right now it's easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them. However, I do do belive that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the people they are used by. I belive this for @NUM1 reasons. One, they take away from spending time with real people, they make people get less excersis, and also they are very distracting and waste time. One reason why I don't think computers have a positive effect on people is that the time spent on the computer could be put to better use by doing things with family and friends. Now and day people are using social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to talk with people far away. People can spend hours communication with someone they will never meet and completly ignore the people who care for and love them. This can lead to a sense of isolation and weaken important personal bonds. Also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are. Overall, setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. This feeling can never occur through the internet. Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a lack of excersise for many people. People who use computers for many hours are just sitting still. They aren't being active. The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button. This is clearly not enough excersise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. Studies have shown that since the invention of computers young people especially have been gretting less and less physical activity, which can contribute to various health issues over time. I'm sure that this will continue to get worse if people continue spending a majority of time on their computers. A third reason why I think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time. An example of this is that once when I was online doing research for a school project, I saw an advertisment for a website that looked interesting. When I clicked on it I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project. When I relized what I had done I rushed to finish my research and ended up getting a poorer grade then I'm sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted other things to do on the computer. This is why I think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them. They take away from spending time with family and friends, they result in less excercise, and they waste time and are distractions.
1347	1351	1	3	Dear local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have been using computers for years. But @CAPS3 it good for there health. Were not thinking about what power teens have with the internet. If you need info. We have lots of great books. If we need communication we have phones. We need to go outside and exercise. @CAPS3 the computer another reason why america @CAPS3 becoming obese? First, teens can do harmful stuff on the internet to themselves or others. People have invented facebook and myspace. Almost every teen in america has a facebook. Did you know that theres cyberbullying now. People have humiliated others on the internet, leading to serious emotional distress. How do we know that the person were talking to @CAPS3 who he/she say's he/she @CAPS3? Teens give away to much info of themselves, some have gone missing from such an action. The internet @CAPS3 a powerful weapon, but can teens handle this kind of power? Next, although the computer @CAPS3 a convient device. @CAPS3 it not true that we have something called books. We cant believe everything that @CAPS3 said on the computer, as misinformation is rampant online. We can get all that we need and more off of books. People lived in the middle ages without computers, but with books. Why can we. Have we grown lazy to do such a thing as to get up and look through a book. Finaly, if communication we seek, then why not a simple text or call. we go through all the trouble of turning on and opening pages just to chat online. We have become lazy because of device's that have all we need in our homes. sure its a good thing but dont forget a bad one to. It seems like the computer @CAPS3 another reason for america growing obese. We need to get up walk, hang out with friends, do sports. But how can we when were adicted to computers. It's like a powerful drug. To conclude I think computers are not good for us. Teens with the power of facebook. Fake and dangerous info when we have book. Lastly, our own health. At this point I ask you, @CAPS3 the computer worth everything we think it @CAPS3? No, it @CAPS3 not.
1348	1352	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years, the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising, and enjoying nature. Is this good or bad? Technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park. Computers do have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage exercise, advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature, and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world. Firstly, computers are full of great advertisements. Some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising, promoting a healthy and active lifestyle. Studys show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, whereas only @PERCENT1 of kids with computers do not get enough exercise. These statistics show that computers are better for people's health than they are thought to be. Next, computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world. By doing this, people's intellegence will increase because they will learn new facts about new places. Also, people will be happier because they enjoy travel, seeing new sights and experiencing different cultures. Lastly, people's jobs will benefit it they're business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet. Finally, the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer. Social sites such as facebook alow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled. Webcams allow people to talk face to face up close about the new gym they joined. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people say they have a better social life online then out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise, encourage travel, and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world. Technology is there to make the world a happier , healthier, and more social place. That is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world.
1349	1353	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 our nain forest growing back, service that takes only a few second, and being able to find practically any answer to any question. What could cause this phenominon. The answer is computers. These electronic wonder help us and our planet in some many ways. because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information. You @MONTH1 be asking yourself how computers are ecofriendly. Well, for starters they help slow the waste of paper. Did you know that the @LOCATION1 kills aproximately @NUM1 million trees a year for book. Computers help prevent this in several way. For example instead of sending a short letter to the police cheif asking about what the new driving law is. You could send an email and save the paper. Also if you wanted the newspaper staff to interview the people that survived the power plant explotion you could send them all an e-mail with instructions to the surviers house insted of giving out maps individually. So now you see how ecofriendly computers are. My next reason was the eficentcy. My dell laptop @CAPS2 home takes about @NUM1 min to iload, @NUM3 sec to get on the internet, and @NUM4 sec to get to another webpage. So say that I want to know how many legs a centiped has (parents don't know either) without a computer it would take @NUM5 min to get to the library, @NUM6 min to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 min to find a book about cenipeeds. In total thats a least @NUM8 mins but my computer would only take @NUM1 min @NUM10 sec about. Also if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on @DATE1. I would only take a few seconds to send an email and she would answer quickly back, because she most likely on the computer a. My third reason was because computer are loaded with information, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 library I might find @NUM4 book on a sudject but on a computer I @MONTH1 find thousand. Once I was doing a report on monarch butterflys. @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 library I found @NUM12 books about them, On the internet I found @NUM13 wedsites on them! Also books have general information like just @CAPS5 life, but the internet has specific information the @CAPS5 part in the enviorment. As you now know computers help not only humans but the eviorments this is because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information.
1350	1354	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive affect on society. I believe computers have a positive affect because they help us learn of faraway places, they help us communicate with friends and family all over the world, and computers help entertain people. The computer has a positive affect on society because on it you can learn of faraway places, their history, and you can learn of their landscape. By learning these things you can do a lot of things such as plan a vacation, this information can help you on a school report, also this information can help you learn of your heiratage & your culture, connecting you to your roots. Also computers have a positive effect and are beneficial to society because they help you communicate with friends and family all over the world! You can communicate with anyone you know, sharing photos and life updates instantly. Nowadays everyone uses the computer as their main form of communication. In a study it showed that @PERCENT1 of people in the world has a computer as a communication tool. Lastly computers are beneficial to society because they entertain us. On a computer you can do many things to never get bored. You can play games, surf the web, or you can watch videos on networks such as youtube, accessing endless content. So on a computer you'll never be bored. The computer is beneficial and has a positive affect on society. The computer helps us learn of faraway places, it lets us communicate with friends and family all over the globe, and lastly the computer entertain us. Thats why the computer is beneficial to society.
1351	1355	1	3	"I don't think computers benefit society as much as everyone thinks. When people spend most of their time on computers they don't have time to spend with their family, people don't exercise enough when they are on computers which causes them to become obese, and you might meet up somewhere with a bad person you met on Facebook or Myspace. These are the main reasons computers don't benefit society. The number one reason computers aren't beneficial is because you need some time to spend with your family. But, when you are on computers twenty-four-seven you have absolutely no time with your family and friends. I believe that families need to eat dinner together and have at least one hour with one another. Some good ways to spend time with your family is to play board games together, go on a walk in the park, or even go on a bike ride together. Did you know that computers have a medium sized effect on how people become obese? If you are at school from seven until two-thirty and after school you spend seven hours on your computer you will become fatter because you will have absolutely no time to exercise. When you just eat and don't exercise your body will not just burn off all that fat you consumed. When you are on a computer you are probably going on to Facebook or Myspace. On these chatting websites you can make arrangements to go somewhere with someone you don't even know. If you meet up with them they could be a killer, a kidnapper, or a rapist. So therefore you can literally die or get hurt because of your computer. That's why e-mail is the absolute safest way to chat online if you were to have a computer. These are the main reasons why computers are not beneficial to society. Also you might not spend enough time with family or friends, you can become obese because you don't have ""time"" to exercise and you can be kidnapped by someone you don't even know through Facebook or Myspace. How would you like it if you had no time with your family, you were obese, and you got kidnapped because you met up with someone that you thought was nice through Facebook or even Myspace? Ultimately, the social and physical costs associated with computer use outweigh their perceived benefits."
1352	1356	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a very unique and advanced device. They give entertainment, pleasure, and knowledge for some people. I do not agree with the fact that computers are a good part of society. Although you do need computers for certain tasks, there are some significant reasons to which I am saying this. Typing is faster than hand writing and its neater, which can be useful. With all the different websites, you can advertise and buy important things on the internet and talk to people from around the world. With all of these good reasons there should be an instant choice of whether they're good or bad. But there is a main reason against them. It's a reason that tells us it is bad. Computers are for people who can't get off them to write a hand written report or drive to the store to buy something. People forget how to do things without them. If computers never existed, the world would no doubt be a better all around place. There are a lot of reasons in which computers are bad. They hold information which can be hacked and seen by somebody that you don't want to know something. Cyber bullying is a bad thing about computers. Another big issue is those stupid online games. People get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese, neglecting their health and responsibilities. So as I said before, computers are not a good part of society and should be used with caution. This would be of good importance to me if you took my letter into consideration. Remember that computers can take advantage of your life and make you into someone you're not. Please make that decision carefully. I hope that you live a full life and enjoy reading my letter. P.S. Try not to get involved with any online games being a nationwide disease that is spreading laziness.
1353	1357	1	3	"Dear School District editor, I have recently seen on the channel five news that you want to know about the effects computers have on people. In the past, not everyone had computers and got knowledge from them. Ninety percent of the students surveyed at the student council agree computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users would be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. Ninety percent of the students recently took a survey at the student council, agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination. Dr. Smith, an expert in relationship to humans said, ""People without computers can't do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination. The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. When you can't look up and learn about places, you are not knowledgeable about them. You're lucky if you know where in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places on a map. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. Eighty-five percent of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books alone. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friendships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people from various backgrounds. You can talk to people in Japan that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the world to all people. Ninety percent of parents who took a poll in our community say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you to see the clear benefits."
1354	1358	1	3	City Times, Computers are very helpful devices. Life would be very hard without them. Not only are they helpful, but they are fun and easy to use! I believe that computers have a great effect on people because you can keep in touch with family and friends, go on school websites and use search engines. Friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives. Computers can help you keep in touch with them! The three applications that I mostly use are Skype, AIM, and Facebook. Skype is a free online application that you can download to your computer, add your friends, and video chat! Using this, I keep in touch with my grandmother, my friend who moved, and even a friend from England! AIM (AOL instant messenger) is where you can send messages to friends and get instant replies! It is just like text messaging, only through computers. Lastly, Facebook is a website where you can add friends from all around the world! I am friends with tons of family that I don't get to see very often, a friend who moved to California, and many other people that have moved! Facebook, AIM, and Skype are great ways to keep in touch with other people! When you are home sick from school and need to make up school work, instead of calling a friend from each of your classes, go to the school's webpage! All teachers should have their own website that you can get from there. On their pages, they should have posted homework, quizzes/tests schedule, favorite links, projects, and their e-mail address. I find this very helpful because even if you don't understand your homework, you can e-mail your teacher! Not only do school websites have teachers pages, but they also have lunch menus, events coming up, the school address and phone number, and many more! School could be a lot more difficult without a website. Do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it? www.Google.com has the answer to everything! You can find webpages, videos, pictures, translators, etc. Google is not the only search engine on the internet, there is also Yahoo, Bing, Ask, Dogpile, and many others! These can all help you find answers, pictures, videos and many more! I often use these to find pictures for a school project, webpages for research, translators to check my spanish homework and videos to show my friends! If we did not have search engines, life would be a lot harder. Computers, as you can tell, are extremely helpful, easy, and fun to use. People love them and use them all the time. I hope that you agree with computers having a great effect on people! Staying in touch with family and friends, having a good education, and finding answers within a click is the easiest way to go through life successfully.
1355	1359	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers have a huge effect on society, can you even imagine where we would be without them? They are great for communication, learning, and shopping. Computers have a large effect on people. Without computers, communication with co-workers, family, and friends would be nearly impossible. Social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn play a huge role in everyday life. These are the sites you use to access information from others to making plans for the weekend. Do you think that your children use the internet too much? Nowadays, that is their way to communicate with their peers. It makes them more social, which is a great quality to have in life. Also, I don't know about you, but I have talked to many people around the world using the internet. It gives you the chance to experience other cultures firsthand. Communication was absolutely not as easy before having computers. It may seem hard to believe, but you can learn tremendous amounts of things from the internet. This may include learning about people. How would you video chat with someone without Skype or FaceTime? You can learn a lot about a person from talking to them face to face, a thing that can't be done on a phone call. Also, research for school could not be done without the internet. In a recent survey, eight out of ten teenagers said that they use a search engine site, such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing at least once a day, seven out of ten of those eight said that it is for school. If it weren't for these search engines, children wouldn't be doing too great in school. Clearly, the computer provides ample ways to research and learn on a daily basis. It may sound ridiculous, but in 2023, forty percent of shopping was done on the internet. If someone wants to start a business, their first stop is usually the internet. People are making money every year with the help of computers. People find it easiest to buy something with the click of a mouse. It is easier than the hassle of crowded malls and long lines. Also, do you remember when Black Friday was the time to put the alarm clock on for four AM? Well, now people do holiday shopping online, there are hundreds, even thousands of sites that offer great sales. Now think about how purchasing items would be if it weren't for the internet. It's not a great image, is it? As you can tell, computers have affected our lives in a great way. Communication, learning, and even shopping have become much simpler. Many may think that computers are not bad to have, but the good overshadows those negative aspects completely.
1356	1360	1	3	I support the advance in technology especially in computers. Using the computer can teach hand-eye coordination, give you the ability to learn about faraway places or people, and give you the opportunity to talk online with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill to have. it quickens reflexes during everyday life. Hand-eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball, football, or basketball. Without computers, many people would lack hand-eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country, but doesn't know anything about it, he could lost it we on the internet. The internet is a major part in having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Some people think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise, which is true in some cases, but the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computers is almost a neccesity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend, and one day meet them in real life. This can be dangerous for younger people, so be careful. I support the advancement in computer technology because it gives people greater reflexs, gives people the opportuniyt to research faraway places, and gives people access to the internet to chat with people online. These are three huge advantages than using computers give people.
1357	1361	1	3	"In modern society, it is rare that you come across someone who doesn't know how to basicly operate a computer. According to the statistics project known on youtube as ""shift happens"", most children in the United States, ninety percent in facts, have used a computer by age four. While it can be debated that computers are bad, i firmly disagree. Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. they have helped education, reconnecting, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and i hope that after reading this, you will too. At my schoo, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. Wheni look at these amounts and addit to what i know about computers in other public schools, it is clear to me that computers have helped the education system. Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button. There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. Also, teachers can put their grade books in their had drive. This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade. As a student, i think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways, but mostly in those above. At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. There are social networks such as facebook, twitter, and Myspace, that are valuable for finding your friend from summer camp. Let's say you have been connected with someone, and you've just found out that you got a promotion. You want to call, but you don't know the hone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at it, ask for a phone number!) It's always great to talk with old friends. Computers have helped the United States make that easier. My friend recently purchased a sony laptop. She liked not only the features, but that it was an energystar, or eco-friendly. Now a days, computers have been made green in the battle for the environment. Paper is saved with online encylopedias, newspapers, journals, etc. Not only that but computers are needing less and less electricity. You save green and are green! Today's society is helping mother nature not only in our actions, but in computers too. In my opinion, computers are helping the United States, not hurting the United States. They have assisted education, social reconnecting and the environment. We must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer."
1358	1362	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Don't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom Sarah was a size six in the waist. Sarah would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, Dell Inspiron laptop for her birthday. Sarah quickly became addicted to Solitaire and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. Sarah is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that seventy percent of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad John. When John gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when Billy (five years old) bothers him because he wants to play. John is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. Thirty-two percent of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin Emily. Last summer, Emily became a member of Facebook Myspace, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when Emily was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her Facebook account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, I hope you take my suggestion seriously and bann computers.
1359	1363	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, It has come to my attention that we are debating on weather or not computers benefit society. Well if you ask me, I think it does. For one computers help with entertainment. Second of all, they're very information. Lastly, computers make life less stressful. In the following paragraphs I will explain on my reasoning. Firstly, computers give entertainment. Now I can see why people say we should go out side more and excersize but, what are supposed to do on a rainy day? Well, you could go on the computer! Plus, computers give children enjoyment and make them happy, instead of being sometimes. Another reason why computers are good, is they can give children modivation. Say you're child really wants to play a new game on his favorite website, but his homework isnt done you could tell him if he gets his homework done he can play on the computer. Also, you could give him a time limit on it too. Lastly, for a teenager or older they are more social than little children. They go on things like ; twitter, facebook and myspace. Computers is probably their first or second way they communicate. Unfortuneatley. Some people abuse these rights and people get in trouble. But the good thing is you can customize you page so that won't happen. Any way children become more social. Secondly, computers are informational. They can tell you a lot by just the touch of keypad and the click of a mouse. You can search someone or something across the whole world. If you want to know the mother and how to prepare for it, just look it up and do what you have to. Also, if you find out something new tell people, you can spread the knowledge. Thirdly, computers make things less stressfull. which would you rather do, type or write five pages? Well I'd type! computers make things more organized so it's easier to find things. It also makes it easier to find things, like files because you can just do to ""my documents"" and find it. As you can set computers are an important part our lives. Can you imagine a world without computers? I sure couldn't! So far i've said computers are entertaining, informational and make things less stressful. I hope you take my letter into concideration."
1360	1364	1	3	I agree with the many peole that but benefits society. Computers can be used as a learning tool, allows communication with distant family and friends. Lastly computers give you something to do in your free time, such as playing games. First of all, I know many people think that others wasted their time on computers. But most computer users us the computer as a tool to learn and get work done. There are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want. If you want to know more about different cultures such as Japanese culture. There are websites to tell you everything you wih want to know. Computers also help yet work done. There are multiple programs designed to make writing papers or presenting information much easier Many people use these programs to yet ahead in their work and present facts easier by using these programs it is very hard to lose and work that you do because it is all saved into the computer. Next, computers are agreat way for many people to pass some free time. Many websites are designed for this reason. Some allow you to play games and other websites let you watch video made by other people, while some people may spend to much time on this many offers know moderaton and spread their time even other websites hard videos that are used to portray important issues, for example the president has given many through online videos because more often people are on their computers and not watching television. Lastly, computers are a great way to communate with distant firends and family. There are so many ways to do, such as email, or many of the social networking websites. My family being immigrants from another country my family. Thinks this is a vauables tool for talking with our family, and I am sure that htere are many ohters who use the computer this way as well. People also make and keep in touch with great friends through the internet. I use E-mail as a way to keep in touch with many of my friends that I haven't seen in tears, my parents have also found long lost friends that they had before we moved through facebook I also allows people to communate important ideas faster than a letter could. Many scientists use the internet to publish ideas and experiments. Finally, I agree with people who sad computers benefits society computers help by being a tool to learn and get work done, pass free time and see important information and lastly computers allow communcation with very far and distant family members.
1361	1365	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that when kids or even adults get computers, then they would not use it for good causes. When people get computers they spend more time inside and on them. They need to get outside get some exercise, perhaps by taking a jog to a friend's house instead of riding a bike. When people spend more time on their computers than talking to your friends, then they will be low on socializing and, after a while, won't know how to communicate with people. All they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise. Computers could also be used for good things. If you have a project for school and need to type it up on the computer or find pictures on the internet then the computer would be a good resource. If you have a job for working with computers or fixing computers, then you would spend a lot of time on your computer. It also lets you interact with people on the other side of the world, and you can also learn about interesting facts or places. Computers could also be used for bad reasons. When people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got, which can lead them into getting obese. They can also use it for sexual harassment or for stalking people. People can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or other illegal things. So as you can see computers aren't safe in a lot of ways. I hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them. Thank you and have a good day.
1362	1366	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs a few miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer excessively it's bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go on the computer, but she always makes me go outside and run around. People are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit there on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger child the wrong ideas. For example I have two younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be a video sharing site because bad people post videos and the little children could see them and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad.
1363	1367	1	3	Dear Editor, I would like to inform the public that using computers isn't so bad. The first reason I think makes computers good is because of the people we can meet via email, Yahoo, or Gmail. For instance we could meet someone from another country and learn about his or her culture or beliefs. My second reason I think computers help people is because what if someone didn't have a television or the newspaper; he or she could get the latest news via nbc.com or fox.com and will be able to still find out whats going on in the world. This access to information and global connection shows that computers can be very beneficial when used appropriately.
1364	1368	1	3	Dear local newspaper, what percentage of people all over the world do you think have a computer and think that it has a positive effect on them? Well about a large percentage of the world says that computers are a great way to communicate with friends, family, and different people around the world. They also mentioned now it's a good hands-on eye coordination for adults and students. It is a wonderful educational source to use in schools, jobs, etc. First off the reason why I say that it's a great way to communicate is because of the programs that computers have memorized into them that are little numbers all around universe to connect with your friends, family, and people around earth. For example like Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, etc these are all types of ways to communicate with people and bring more social which is a healthy way in life. More than half the world have these communication sources because one it is easier and you get more of your mind. Another reason why they often have these connections is probably because it's a better way to see one another if you live in different parts of earth. The reason why I said that it's another way of seeing people around the world is because right now I'm living in one city and in order to see the ones I love and care about is by my Myspace and Facebook to be able to see my family and friends that live in different locations from me like other states and countries. Another reason is because it's a good hands on eye coordination on adults and students, helping with skills and learning.
1365	1369	1	3	When you use a computer, you have the ability to do virtually anything. The internet has millions of users and makes life a lot easier. You have access to talk with people who are all the way across the world! You can search any topic and learn more about it. The internet even encourages you to get outside and see things for yourself. In the modern day it is just as easy to contact someone in another country as it is to contact someone at the other side of town. As long as you have an internet connection you can stay in touch with a friend that's moved away or on a business trip, anyone! Some people say that you should just use a phone but you could use video chat on the internet. You can see someone who's thousands of miles away, as if they were right in front of you. These days it's harder to not stay in touch than it is to stay in touch. Twenty or thirty years ago any information you needed came from a book. You would have to go all the way to the library, find the right book, and read it. If you were lucky you could find a bit of what you were looking for. These days you simply type it in to a search browser and you instantly get thousands of websites on that topic. The internet allows you to learn about any subject you'd like. You can spend time reading experts or give that some people spend too much time on their computers. Seeing all those great places and beautiful pictures encourages many people to get outside and see it for themselves. On a recent poll a significant percentage of people went on a hike after seeing a youtube video about how great it is to get outside. The internet has a massive effect on us. It can also bring families together. For example at dinner, you can get a great recipe off the internet. In fact, you can get millions of great recipes. The internet was an amazing idea. Many would argue that it was the greatest invention ever. Yes, it can be dangerous, but with proper education on it the internet is a good source of information and an enjoyable past-time, if not abused. Being able to see and talk to others so far away was seemingly impossible a few decades ago. Getting information has never been so easy. We are lucky to live in an age where the internet is right at our fingertips.
1366	1370	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, I know that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of being outside. People are becoming addicted to computers. People are spending way too much time on computers because they're addicted to them, becoming over weight, and not getting any exercise. I am telling you we need to address this matter. People have become addicted to computers. @PERSON1 says that in @DATE1 there were @NUM1 people using computers, and by @DATE2 there are nearly @NUM2 million people using computers, that’s a big increase in the last couple of years. People are becoming more addicted because of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and many more computer sites. Yale says that in @DATE3 the number of people on Facebook was only @NUM3 thousand, but by @DATE4 there is over @NUM4 million people using Facebook. I don’t know about you, but that seems like an addiction to computers to me. People are getting tremendously over weight. One cause of this is addiction to computers; people just sit in front of their computers and eat and eat and eat until they're over weight and unhealthy. Dr. @PERSON2 says that in the last @NUM5 years the average weight of a person has gone up @NUM3 pounds due to them sitting in front of their computers and eating. Doctors say they can’t do anything about people's weight unless they turn off all of their computers, which they don’t think is possible. People are just getting too fat from sitting and doing nothing all day. Exercise is a key part of staying healthy. And by sitting in front of a computer eating, you're not getting your exercise that is needed, so people are getting fat. Dr. @PERSON3 says that people need to be aware of this problem. Dr. @PERSON3 also says that in the last @NUM7 years the amount of exercise people are getting has decreased by @PERCENT1; that’s why people are getting fat. He also says that it’s due to sitting in front of the computer and eating. People are getting no exercise due to computers. I’m telling you this is a huge problem that we need to address. People are becoming addicted to computers, they're getting over weight, and getting no exercise. Please @CAPS1 post, listen, it’s a serious problem, but it is your decision to act upon this information.
1367	1371	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that the negative effects of computers on people are much greater than the positive effects. Computers have caused a massive amount of obesity in the @LOCATION1 and that number is growing every day. Computers can also be time-consuming, and people could spend hours and even days on a computer without doing anything else. Lastly, computers can be dangerous to many kids and could even end up in death. I feel that computers are too harmful for society and should be stopped. Obesity is one of the biggest problems in the @LOCATION1 and is growing bigger every day. Over @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population is obese, and computers have been a major contributor. Put yourself in the mind of a computer addict. It is dinner time and you are hungry, but you don't want to lose too much time off of your computer. You hurry down to the nearest fast-food store and buy yourself a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. You then go back to your house and eat the food while on your computer. Not only is the fast-food bad for you, but you don't even give your body a chance to burn off those calories and carbohydrates that you just ate by exercising. Computer addicts do this almost every day and before they know it, they have gained @NUM1 pounds! In addition, people who use computers for hand-eye coordination can develop it in other ways than just going on a computer. Computers contribute to a large portion of the obese population, but they also can be extremely time-consuming. People on computers waste a huge amount of their time. These people stay on their computers for hours and sometimes they don't even realize it. They say, ""Okay, let me check my email. Oh look, I received a message! Well, let me just change my social media account."" One thing leads to another and in the blink of an eye, @NUM2 or @NUM3 hours have already passed by. People who stay on computers all day waste precious time that could be spent with family, exercising, or finding a true love. Time is so precious in our lives and we must not waste it staying on a computer every day. Not only can they be time consuming, computers can also be dangerous. Kids around the country are being killed, raped, and bullied due to computers. They show their pictures on chat sites, give away too much personal information, and before they know it, there is a critical knocking on their front door. Also, there have been kids who committed suicide because they were bullied on the internet. Cyberbullying can be just as harmful, if not more harmful, than regular bullying. These kids face such strong mental and emotional harm that they make bad decisions, including suicide, and their performance drops in school. In addition, there can be explicit content on the internet, including pictures and videos that can harm a child's young mind. The danger of computers is so great that they should be considered a serious threat. Computers are too risky, which is why they shouldn't be so prevalent. Lastly, they can be extremely dangerous to children. Because of these significant dangers, computers should be banned from our society for the well-being and safety of the @LOCATION1."
1368	1372	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Local newspaper, I heard that you were concerned about people and how they use the computer too much. I think that computers are a good thing to have because many people use computers for school, work, etc. I think that computers are of good use; many people use them for research and resources. It is easier to use them when you are going on vacation because you can check out how much hotels are, where restaurants are, and what interesting places are there, instead of calling or driving around. Computers are good for school because I think books are harder and take longer to use than computers. Also for questions, you can go to one of the websites and you ask the question and many other people might answer the question you're looking for. They're also useful for work; most people use computers for work. They can put their taxes and documents on their computers. Computers can be used just for fun too. There are chat rooms, Facebook, and games. I think that computers are useful for many things, but I also think that some people spend too much time on them as well. Computers are great, but you should also use other things too like maps, books, etc. Many can spend @NUM1 hours on the computer Facebooking and gaming. I think that it's important for people to go outside and hang out with friends. A lot of people spend their time on the computer during @DATE1 because it's cold and sometimes snowing. I don't think that they should spend their whole time on the computer though because you don't just want to depend on electronics every time. I think that computers should not be used a lot in the @DATE2 because I think hanging out with friends and family is important and also the weather is nice. I think that computers can be very useful with directions, work, and school work, but you shouldn't spend a lot of time on them. Electronics aren't everything in life. Thank you for taking your time reading this, and I hope you do agree with me about the balanced use of computers.
1369	1373	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers are beneficial to society even though some people don't because they give us a means of communication, computers give us the ability to learn about foreign people or places, and computers help businesses in so many ways. Computers are a must-have in a society. Computers give us a means of communication such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6-mail, and so much more. Without the computer, families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button. @CAPS5 lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night. Long distance calls cost money and it is not worth @MONEY1 a call if you call every couple of days. Communication has evolved so much in the past @NUM1 years. Computers are just the beginning of this evolution. That is why computers are beneficial to communication. Computers give us the ability to look up facts about foreign places and people in a matter of minutes. We could look up who was the leader of @LOCATION1 in the past and would get multiple sites on the subject. Computers help us expand our learning capabilities and give us a chance to learn things that normally we wouldn't. That is another reason why computers are very beneficial to society. The last reason that supports the fact that computers are beneficial to society is because computers help keep track of much data. They help with work data and they help @PERCENT1 of businesses file reports and communicate with other branches of that company. I learned in class that jobs were much more difficult in the past than they are today because of technology like computers. Some people think that using computers deprives people of going out and exercising, but it only takes @NUM2 minutes to check your @CAPS6-mail or look up something. Computers are beneficial to society because without computers, our lives would be much more complicated and less efficient.
1370	1374	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think we should have computers for great purposes. One reason is because there is a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on many different websites. My last reason is because you can send messages to a faraway place by using e-mail. My first reason states that there is a lot more information on the internet. For example, if you don't have the newspaper with you, but you have your laptop, you can get information that way. Did you know, over @NUM1 million people use their laptops for information and not just for games? Another example is if we get the newspaper every day but it doesn't have the article that we are looking for, we use the internet. When we look for information on the internet, you would use Yahoo, Google, and other informational websites that you need. My second reason states that there is some history on many different websites. For instance, you can go on a website and learn about history every day, instead of going to a museum about history every day! One day, I had to make a project about the @CAPS4 and I had four days to do it; you know what I did, I went on a historical website about the @CAPS4. I got an A+ for my project. When people need history, it's always all around them on the internet. My very last reason states that instead of texting people from faraway places, why not just use an e-mail address. For example, you don't have to pay for an e-mail address. It's actually free and did you know, more than @NUM3 million people around the world use an e-mail address instead of texting other people. When you don't have an e-mail address, it's very quick to make one. You don't have to waste money to text someone halfway around the globe. In conclusion, I think that we should have computers. One reason is that we have a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on some websites. And my last reason is because you can send messages to a far away place by using e-mail. Thank you for reading this article and considering my points.
1371	1375	1	3	"New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers is a benefit to society. Most people do not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in touch with them, no matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, ""I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eyes off the screen."" Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isn't all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicians put together. If you have a school assignment to write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plenty of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing what's going on. Do you like to stay organized? I personally think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people need the computer to do their job and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working humans is a larger amount. So, think about it, if computers weren't made, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would not have jobs, or they would have to keep everything down on paper which @MONTH1 be a catastrophe. After a while, you @MONTH1 want to back everything up by copying all of your photos, files, music etc. to a @CAPS4 so you don't lose everything if your computer shuts down. After reading this, don't you agree with me, that computers are a benefit to society? There are many more reasons but this paper had a lot. I hope you have realized that without computers, the world wouldn't be as it is today. Thank you for your time."
1372	1376	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I am writing a letter to discuss the fact that computers have a negative effect on the average American, here are my reasons: people are not spending much time outside, there is a lack of exercise, and they do not interact with their family as much. Not spending much time outdoors can have a big effect on mother nature. Such as they will begin to care less about our wonderful earth and not care to pollute because if they took the time to go outside instead of running the air conditioner they can save the money and go be with their friends. Lack of exercise can be very bad for your health. Sitting down all day on the computer is not exercise its laziness. When you exercise you feel good about yourself, your adrenaline starts going, you can stay fit and you won't have to worry about being unhealthy if you take yourself away from the computer. When you do not interact with your family and instead of eating dinner together one person is on the computer and the others are watching @CAPS1. You might argue with your family a lot and don't you want to have a healthy relationship. So why don't you encourage your family to sit down at the table and discuss how your day went. I stated my reasons why I think computers have a negative effect on people. I hope that you agree with my reasons so we can find a way to get everyone off their computers and get active.
1373	1377	1	3	Wouldn't you like to find a @NUM1-star hotel or restaurant with a click of a button? I know I would like to. So should we keep using computers for the good of our society, or not use computers to exercise more? Computers are helpful to us by doing work that has to be done neatly. It also helps by accessing and surfing the internet to find more useful stuff. A computer is very intelligent and not only can come in a boring, heavy, boxed shape. Computers are also in some electronics. If you go on vacation and forget to turn off the lights, you can use your hand held computer to turn it off. Communication is pretty easy on a computer. All you need is a computer (of course), a microphone or headset, some speakers, and a special software. After you have all of these, you can connect with the rest of the world! Talk to loved ones or family members through your computer. If you want, you can also get a web cam, a video camera used on your computer. Then you can see others face to face! If you do not have anything I just said, there is also texting. Just use your computer keyboard to type and send a message. Your computer can also do a lot more things. You can play mindless video games! Your computer must have the right specifications to play it. Sure it might be pricey to get a good one, but the benefits of communication and convenience make it worthwhile for many people in our society today.
1374	1378	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? Of course you @CAPS1, that's where you get all the information you need. Computers are good and everyone should have one. The computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know. It also lets you communicate with your family, friends, or other people you need to communicate with. It can also let you see disasters in other countries and teach you about the world. Computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways. Computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know. If you're in school and you need to @CAPS1 research, well there you go, you have a computer to help you. This is also good for jobs. Any one can use them and learn new things at the same time. It let's you @CAPS1 work, learn new things, and it's fast and easy to @CAPS1. You don't have to @CAPS1 all that hard work of looking for a book and spending so much time looking for the information you need. Computers are great and you should use it. Another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them. If you have family or friends that live far away or in another country, then you can communicate with them by computers. You can easily webcam with them or e-mail. This is very easy and this way you can stay close to them. This is also good if you @CAPS1 business online. You can @CAPS1 your job and talk to the people you need to talk to. If you ever have to arrange an emergency meeting and don't have time to call the people you need to, then simply send them an e-mail and you're set for the meeting the next day and so are they. This is a perfect way for communication and business. My final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and you really wanted to see them, then you can go on your computer and see the news and learn new things and see what bad things have happened. Also if you live some where that isn't your home town, then you can go online and see what is going on at your hometown and visit for any special occasions. You can learn a lot of new things about other countries. Also you can learn about new places if you ever want to move to another country. You can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation. This is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places. In conclusion to all of my facts, computers are good. It lets you learn new things and @CAPS1 research. Also, it lets you communicate with family, or friends in case of emergencies. Computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries. If you have a computer, then that is great. If you don't then you better go out and get one because these computers are awesome and can @CAPS1 just about anything you need. Stop waiting and get online or go out and buy one.
1375	1379	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people are using computers for excessive amounts of time a recent study confirmed this reporting that ""@PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day"". That means people have less time to exercise, enjoy nature and socialize. I consider that the benefits of computers are greatly outwayed by the problems that arise from them to sum up, computers limit a person's health—both physical and social—and do more harm than good to society. Spending too much time on computers can deteriorate a person's health by preventing them from spending that time exercising take for example @LOCATION3, who goes on computer at least five times a week, for about four hours. @LOCATION3 has stopped playing soccer because she prefers to spend time on facebook. Instead of receiving six hours of exercise a week, she now receives an hour this has led to @LOCATION3 gaining weight and losing health. The problem is there are millions of children like @LOCATION3 who are not getting enough exercise instead opting to spend too much time on their computers. Another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature. Now, they choose to surf the web instead. This leads to people caring less about our planet and animals. Nature is very important and can be extremely fun, so this is a shame. Furthermore, those who choose to spend overwhelming amounts of time on computers tend to interact less with family members. No longer do most children help cook, clean, do chores, or spend time with siblings. One mother says ""ever since my daughter got her new laptop, she hasn't gone once to play with her baby brother or friends"" unfortunately the same is true for most teens today computers have limited how much time families spend together. In conclusion, computers do harm to society they keep people cooped up in their rooms, instead of exercising, enjoying nature, or having fun with their families and friends. In doing so, computers have become a menace to society. Therefore, @CAPS1 is crucial that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time to exercise or socialize, even to do nothing at all would be better overall, computers are no longer beneficial to society."
1376	1380	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I has come to my attention that many of us disagree on weather computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers do not benefit society. Many people in today's modern world spend way to much time on the computer when they could be exercising, spending time with family and friends, and enjoying nature. Read on and I am sure you will agree. First of all, computers are becoming a problem in society because they interfear with our physical well being. The @LOCATION1 is continuingly growing. Not in our population but the size of our people! According to a recent survey @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in the @LOCATION1 are overweight or obease. ""The main culprit of the @ORGANIZATION2's percent of obeasity is not over eating it is actually electronics! Especially things like computers."" said @PERSON1 a surgean at @ORGANIZATION1, after dealing with a severe case of obesity. Obesity is not a hard thing to get rid of. All we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen. America needs to get outside! It can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk. Whatever you do just get off your computer and go outside or the gym for exercise! Secondly, computers interfere with family and friends. I know from personal experience that parents hate it when their kids will miss family dinner or won't go out with their friends because they ""need"" to finish the next level on their game or they ""need"" to look something up on the internet. Family and friends should be a very important thing in your life but unfortunatly, for most people it is not. Psycologist, @PERSON2 has discovered that overall, having family and friends that you can count on beside you will make you a much happier more enjoyable person."" @CAPS1 eliminating computers from our lives we will create a happy and more pleasent society for the people of the @LOCATION1. Doing everyone a favor. Furthermore, if we cut back on our hours on the computer we will have a better chance to expeirence the wonder's mother nature has to offer us. Most people don't realize how much they are missing @CAPS1 not going outside. There are amazing things, right in your own backyard, that you will probably never get to expeirience because you are too addicted to playing on the computer. @NUM3 years ago people were able to function fine with out computers so we should be able to too. @PERCENT1 of people have never even been camping! So next time you feel like spending another @NUM4 hours on the computer, take a walk and I'm sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors. In conclusion, computers do not benefit society. They just keep people away from going outside, enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends. I hope I have convinced you to see my side of the argument and thank you for your time."
1377	1381	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a negative effect on people. One reason I think this is because people need exercis. They shouldn't be sitting at a desk all day playing games on the computer. Especially kids should be outside playing and exercising. More and more people will become obess if all they do is sit at a computer all day and eat junk food. If more people execis more people will start eating the right food and many people will be much healthier and live healthier and happier lives. My second reason on why I think computers are negative is some kids @MONTH1 get cyberbullied. This is when someone gets bullied online. Kids do this so they don't have to say it in person and they could say anything they want and the other person @MONTH1 not even know who it is. Another thing is kids @MONTH1 meet someone they don't know and think is nice but you don't know who he really is. He could make you, by tricking you, do stuff that normally you wouldn't do cause you think he's your age or he likes you. Many girls have gotten taken because of this. My last reason is people could miss out on fun activities, with family or friends like going swimming in the @DATE1 or sleding in the winter. If your home at the computer you can't do fun activities outside and exercis while doing it. Theses are my reasons I think computers have a negative effect on people.
1378	1382	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I belive that computers offer a lot more pros than they do cons. Computers offer another way to learn things about the world. Computers @MONTH1 also act as a research, tool. If a child, or anyone @CAPS3 on the computer and a family member thinks it @CAPS3 an unreasonable amount of time, that sounds like it @CAPS3 just an issue between the person and his or her family. Many people @MONTH1 argue and say, ""look in the encyclipedea to learn about the world, ""but a computer @CAPS3 faster, easier more time efficient to use. In fact, most people in the newest generation of families probably don't have an encylipea set. For example, if I were to want to learn more about @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 of searching in a dictionary or encyclipea, I could go on the computer, type in @LOCATION1 and a whole slew of liks and opportunities are found. Some people @MONTH1 like the old ways, but personally. I like the freedom and easiness of a computer. Have you ever had to research for a project or report? Many people either in school or in the work field will most likely need to research something to get a better understanding. Yes, a dictionary @CAPS3 helpful. Yes a thesauris @CAPS3 helpful but there are separate things. Compared to a computer those classic research tools are still usefull, but could be a hassle. My point @CAPS3 a computer has a dictionary thesauris, encyclipedea...ect all in @NUM1! So next time you have to research something try reaching for the keyboard @CAPS4 of the bookshelf! To me, the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a Family problem than a social problem. Technology has changed our world! Ever since computers were invented not only have they downsized, but became more and more useful. The computer has opened more doors for our scociety, without computers, space travel for example would not be the normality it seems to be in this generation. All im trying to say @CAPS3, I don't think computers hurt our society, but are pretty much the building blocks for our world. While reading this paper I hope you noticed the pros of having computers in this world. A computer @CAPS3 a help learning tool, the king of all reaserch tools and a big part of our society today.If you could learn one thing from reading this paper, I would want you to think, ""@CAPS5 would we, as a world be without computers?""."
1379	1383	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 register, I am writting you to urge you that the affect computers have people is helpful. The reason I say the computers are helpful is because it helps give direction helping the economy and because you can send messages thru quickly (instant messaging). Read on so I could let you know how and why these things about the computer are helpful. @CAPS7 I know I said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this. You know when you need to go out somewhere far and you don't know how to act there and have no @CAPS3 in your car. Well then think about it on computer is your only option left. Like for example when I was going down south @DATE1 we didn't have no @CAPS4.P.S and we didn't know how to get their. So our only option was the computer. We logged on to google on found our direction @NUM1. So this is the first reason @CAPS7 read the next on. Okay, okay, okay. @CAPS7 we all know the way our economy is rediculous. Away computers helping our economy is instead of people driving to go pay there bills, they could pay online. Because it's saving money and the state won't have to pay for questions to get gas for the cars often or get re-build. Like for example this gas station near my house is getting re-built because something went wrong with the pipes @CAPS7 this is costing us all about @MONEY1. @CAPS7 say this isn't away we could save the economy. Its about time to move to the next reason. Listen here, here, here's my @DATE1 reason how computers are helpful. Im other known as instant messaging. This is helpful if you don't have a house phone nor on cellphone and you wanna tell you a family member or friend something really bad had happened then you could tell thru by instant messaging (@CAPS5) because they would surely would get it. Like one time my friend aint have a house phone nor cellphone and somebody was trying to brake into her house she had instant message me to let me know because it could get send to my cellphone. And I called her mom to let her know and befor I know it another massage was coming thru saving ""@CAPS6 you."" @CAPS7 after reading how computers are helpful by helping give direction, save the economy and instant messaging, could you agree with me saying computers are helpful. Its still your opinion but you read minds so think about what you read on say it isn't true."
1380	1384	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves. This is why I think that comperters aren't positive in society.
1381	1385	1	3	"Did you know that in a recent poll in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers everyday? Computers have a very positive effect on people, such as informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away, interacting with others, and learning new facts. Can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers? They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes. they would know right away just by clicking on the internet and could take immediate action to protect their property and loved ones. Another example is if there was a shooting nearby. People would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online, allowing them to avoid the affected area. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed. Not only do computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but @CAPS4 their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and is always looking online for any traffic updates so he can avoid them and get to work on time and safely. Without computers people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they @MONTH1 face. Another positive affect computers have on people, is letting them interact with others, such as video chatting and instant messaging. @PERCENT2 of the world video chats and instant messages. It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends and maintaining connections. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger relationship, sharing stories and seeing each other's faces. Nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? Computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle. A third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things. Students' main source for education is through the computer on the internet. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning"". They are @CAPS4 helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class. That way, the won't need to lug around heavy books, and stress out for forgetting them. @CAPS4, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, making their knowledge grow further with tutorials and practice exercises. Without computers, lives wouldn't be the same in a negative way. Computers help people know news, traffic weather directly, interact with people, and learn new things. Therefore, computers are very positive, since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use them now positively, why stop using such a beneficial tool?"
1382	1386	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 harold, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advancences in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. But computers can be a bad thing. They can deprive children from exercising, enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends. First of all, Computers can stop children from exercising. ""@CAPS1 I can never get outside after school, because I'm checking my email,"" said a @CAPS2 high school student. A recent study shows @PERCENT1 of students at a middle school @CAPS3 when they come home they go right on to the computer, leaving little time for physical activity. This shows that almost half of the students at just the middle school are on the computer. This is why computers can be a bad thing. Secondly, some children spend more time in the great indoors than the outdoors. ""I spend most of my time breathing in airconditioning (or heat) than fresh air,"" reported a @CAPS2 middle school student. Imagine, a child is staring at a computer screen playing a game or on facebook mean while it's a beautiful day in the middle of @DATE1. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students @CAPS3 that they spend more time indoors than out, missing the sunshine and fresh air. Computers can be a bad thing in a childs development. Finally, computers can interfere with a childs time spending with family or friends. ""I @CAPS1 spend an entire evening at a family party on these computer,"" admitted a @CAPS3 elementary student. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 homes have a computer and it is being used @NUM5 by children. This shows that little @PERSON1 of the @PERSON2' house hold is never out side playing with friends, preferring the screen to real human interaction. Computers can do more harm then good in a house hold. It can stop children from exercising, enjoying the out doors and spending time with family. I ask you to tell your children or grand children nieces nephews to cut down on computer time and rediscover the world beyond the screen."
1383	1387	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 we all know more and more people are using computers. Some believe that this would be a concern because it affects peoples health. I believe that with the advances in technology it would give us positive effects on people. Here are three reasons why, first would be that with advances in tech. It would teach us to be more intelligent. Second would be it it would give us the ability to have access to intresting things we can't get at the library like biographics and finally access to communicate online. My first reason @CAPS2 I mentioned before was it would give us intelligence. If we have questions to something we dont know we could search on the computer and find our answer quickly and efficiently. We would learn this and would be able to teach others, spreading knowledge. The computer can give us alot of useful information that can benefit us in the future for school and careers. My second reason is that advance in tech. would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us. Not all information is found in the library the computer has access to biographics, educational website and most important the access to educational advances for example online tutoring for students with difficulties in school, providing extra support. My third and final reason why advance in tech. would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication. Some people will have e-mail for good reason for example teachers have e-mail for educational cause if a student is having problem in work, the student simply send the teacher a e-mail of the what the students difficulty is and what the student can do, facilitating learning outside the classroom. That is all I have to say for now. I hope you think about this and recognize the clear benefits that computer technology brings to our lives and our future.
1384	1388	1	3	Computers have a positive effect on peoples lives. They are big helpers. They teach you skills you need in life. The technology abilities help us with tasks every day. Finally they help people to keep in touch and meet new people. I think that computers have a very positive effect on our lives. Computers teach us many things. First of all just learning how to use the computer is a skill you need in life. At most jobs you have to know how to work a computer. Today computers are essential part of most work environment, from offices to stores. Hand-eye coordination is another skill the computer teaches you. Computers actually help you with sports in a way. To catch a ball you need hand-eye coordination, which is improved by using a mouse and keyboard. The technology the computer gives us helps us alot in life. If you need directions you can look it up on the computer quickly. If you couldn't you would have to call the restaurant for directions, which is less convenient. Without the computers help we would all have to write all of our papers out by hand. For students it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer. We would have to read so many books to get the information, a much slower process. The world would be a much different place without computers. Sometimes people who we love have to move far away from us. It's hard to keep in touch on the phone when that happens. The computer through keep you in touch easily. With programs like facebook, twitter, and @ORGANIZATION1, its possible to maintain those important bonds. You can chat with them and see pictures of how there doing. You could even keep in touch with them from @LOCATION1, making the distance feel smaller. Computers make almost anything possible. In conclusion computers are great machines. They teach us life long lessons. They help us when we need something or have to do a report. Computers even keep people in touch so their relationships don't fall apart. I don't know about you, but I think computers keep the world up and running smoothly and connected.
1385	1389	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 are so many people that addicted to computers. They think that computer can help them but yes to others it helps them to their work and education. Most children are addicted to computer games. @CAPS1 are @PERCENT1 of children who are addicted to computers, which is a significant number. For some reason, computers had a lot of effects on people. It might affect children's education or it might be the cause why your bills of electricity went higher. The worst of having computer at home, it can be a reason for millions of teenagers that got killed for always talking online with people they don't know. Computers are sometimes dangerous for people. Do people still need computer? Having computer at home is not good specially to children. This is because computers can affect their education negatively. Parents don't want that to happen to their children. A lots of uneducated children that stay home or do drugs in the street. Yes computer can help them for their studies or computer can help them for their studies or projects but other children use the computer because they just want to play games. That's why a lot of them didn't learn anything at school but they learn a lot in the computer games, which is not useful for their future. They should stop the computer games. Also, having computers at home can be the cause of people's electricity bills that went higher than they had @DATE1 when they didn't have computers. Other people think that computers can't give you any problem but computers works with electricity and you pay for the electricity bills. If you have @MONEY1 for your electricity bill @DATE1 year when you didn't have computer, it might go high to @MONEY2 for your bill that now you have the computer. It's a big problem for you and your budget. Nevertheless, computers are dangerous. Computers can be good or bad. Without a doubt, @PERCENT2 of teenagers have been killed because of talking online with strangers people. Most website like @CAPS2 is now in danger. @DATE1 @DATE1 months, husband and wife got killed because of @CAPS2. The husband killed his wife because of being ""single"" in her relationship status on her @CAPS2. She got shot by her husband. However, her husband killed himself. They're both got shot! Talking online and meeting up with strangers people you don't know can be a reason of your lost. Parents should not have computers at home unless they will use it but it needs to be at their room where children can't use it. Now is the time to agree! Do we need computers at home? Can we live without the computer? We don't need computers at home and yes we can live without the computer. We can do any activities with our family, exercise for our health, go picnic with friends or we have fun go on vacation with the whole family. Local newspaper, I want you to tell the people to stop the computer and tell them to go out with their family and have fun doing activities or go on vacation to create real memories together."
1386	1390	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it allows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives them less time to study and do school work. Overall, I think that talking is the main use for computers. But, sometimes it is used in the wrong way, for cyberbullying. Experts say that one out of every three kids have things to use to talk online, but they also say that one in four of those kids are bullied online. Also every year you hear about someone, and well most of the time it is because of cyberbullying. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullied online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some children say that kids are happy when they go home because they can't be bullied, but now they can be bullied at their safe place, their home. Another bad thing about the computer is that it replaces exercise. A text and a high school football scout said ""every year there are less and less people who play sports because of video games or computers."" Consequently, the obesity rate of kids has gone up in America and many agree that the cause is computers taking the place of exercise. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. Lastly, now grades are lower than ever for students. Most teachers say that one in six students get good grades and they say that all students that don't spend too much time on the computer. I was watching Discovery Channel and it said that consequently most kids are spending four hours on the computer and less than one hour on studying or homework. The computer was made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool used for cyberbullying, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning! We must reconsider our reliance on this technology."
1387	1391	1	3	Dear Editor of the newspaper, I understand you think computers don’t have an effect on people. Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can communicate with anyone you want. Don't make any decisions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers help people find information quickly. To find information everybody uses either Google or Ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find where a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find out how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because there are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on Word if it's for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is communicate with their friends. Most kids either use Facebook, instant messaging, or Oovoo to communicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computers don't have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. That's not all, computers help people find what they're looking for. It also helps you with your work. Nevertheless computers are a great way to communicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decision that you want to make, as the benefits are clear and significant.
1388	1392	1	3	I think that computers have a good effect on people. When people are on the computer they are not on for very long. I also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new technology. Computers are positive and they can help you when you are stuck or need to look something up. To me computers are positive. When people go on the computer they are not on for eight hours straight. Sure they might be on eight hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school, meals and activities. Some people need computers for their job. News and media companies need computers for editing and printing out the paper. They also put the news on their website. What would most people do without a computer? Computers are positive because of the new technology! The new technology is helping people interact over the internet. If you have a long distance friend or family member, there are so many ways to talk to them. You could use social media, Skype, Oovoo, email or even video calls. When I go on the computer I don't just sit and watch videos or play games online. I interact with my friends. A large percentage of the US population between the ages of thirteen and seventeen have a social media account. Many have Skype or Oovoo and talk to people that are too far away to visit. Computers are positive because they can help you with school work that you don't know; just go on the internet and look it up if you need to translate a word or a phrase just go on the computer and translate it. A significant number of people learned a dictionary on their own using the internet. If there is a word you want to know and isn't in the dictionary look it up and it will be online. Computers have a positive effect on people. Nobody spends so much time on the computer that they can't go outside or hang out with their friends. People actually need the computer for their job and the new technology that is coming out is letting people interact with people across the world. They are positive to have for school work, definitions and even translation. Computers are not negative and they don't take away what you should do in life; they enhance it.
1389	1393	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Do you remember when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye coordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye coordination when people don't even realize it, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye coordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. A professional tennis player said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped me with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye coordination is very useful, for many things; our survey of many people found that most of these people say that hand-eye coordination is a very important skill and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very commonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you communicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email, Facebook and many more. It is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live in one state and her sister, who she is very close to, lives in another state. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to see each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams came out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People might argue that you can just send letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boy's first steps that you just video taped, or a YouTube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you might not have seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether it's a word's meaning or the earthquake in another country. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. A teacher at a local school says, ""We are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so we don't waste paper and will save trees."" This is true, about half of the homework of fifth graders is online, whether it is to look up the equation for photosynthesis or to find out what year a historical figure died in; being online does help the environment. It is important to be able to have computers in schools because it gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like sixth graders having a math class online. It gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientist's experiment or a paparazzi's take on a celebrity's new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the modern era, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye coordination, being able to talk to your friends, and being able to learn, the computer benefits society in numerous ways."
1390	1394	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion they take time away from exercising. Also, no one has time to enjoy nature. Of course, when it comes to family and friends, the time is stifled by the computer. If more people get off their screens and go outside, I'm positive all would be resolved. I'm sure that the computer is affecting everyone negatively. Obesity is a huge problem in our country. One in five children are obese. I feel the computer is contributing to the problem. I remember times when I wanted to go outside and exercise, but the computer dragged me away with all the fun games and videos the internet offers. Sure, the computer is fine in moderation, but many people abuse their privileges. Obesity leads to many health issues such as clogged arteries or strokes. No parent wants to see their child go through that young. But what is the solution? Taking away the computer for many seems drastic. Everybody these days seems to have so much effort making time for real life. I'm sure I would have had more across-the-board time if we went outside more; people have probably done the same. Good times with family are being taken away from us. In conclusion, I feel the computer is an addiction. Millions who are on the computer gain weight. Also, it takes time to enjoy nature but the computer is blocking the way. Another thing the computer puts family and friends on hold. Memories are being stolen by the awful device that is the computer. So we must recognize how bad the computer is for our collective health and relationships.
1391	1395	1	3	"""Dinners ready!"" ""Okay mom, one second""... click, click, click. Are you hearing this from your children more than usual? Well if you are, then you need to listen to this upcoming message. We, the @ORGANIZATION1, believe our children and adults are spending too much time on their laptops or computers. They're not out exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with their family. These problems could lead to bigger problems that @MONTH1 have already taken effect, like: @CAPS2, financial problems, and then depression. So keep reading and think about what you hear that could or has happened to you. @CAPS2 is a huge thing to worry about; kids all over @LOCATION1 are on their computer more than outside. Every day I see my nephew on his computer, and I see him getting fatter and fatter every day. Studies have shown that children and adults that own a Facebook or Myspace account gain about @NUM1 pounds every @NUM2 months. If they're even on @NUM3 to @NUM2 hours a day, they'll gain @NUM5 pounds every month. Sooner or later, the state is going to have the @CAPS2 level rise from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 of @ORGANIZATION1 people who are obese. This could lead to a loss of @ORGANIZATION1 jobs due to laziness. When people spend most of their time on Facebook and Myspace, then they could lose their jobs. More than @PERCENT3 of the state's citizens own a Facebook or Myspace. So when people are addicted to them, they spend more time on that than the stuff they have to do for their jobs. So then they'll get fired and can't pay bills, loans, and mortgages. This then will all lead to depression. Depression is all over the state, even the country. People are losing jobs left and right because of their computers and the internet. People are even committing crimes like murder and even attempting @ORGANIZATION1 suicide because of the loss of @ORGANIZATION1 jobs or family members. Some people are even so addicted to the internet that they ignore the birth of a new family member. This depression needs to stop. So fight for the right to stop the addiction to internet use and live a great life. Drop the computer, read a book, meet up with friends and family, and keep your jobs. Don't let these reasons come between you and your life."
1392	1396	1	3	@CAPS2 people think the invention of the computer and the internet is a terrific thing, but truly @CAPS6 is a terrible time consumer. The local newspaper is doing a survey about people's opinions on technology. People spend way too much time on computers while they could be outside, enjoying nature, exercising, or interacting with people in person. The advancements in technology are just wasting your time. When the weather is nice, people should be outside enjoying @CAPS6 instead of wasting the entire day on the computer. While the @CAPS1 sun can be very harmful to your skin, seeing the sun can help and boost your energy; the carbon dioxide in buildings causes people to become sleepy. @PERCENT1 of people surveyed by @ORGANIZATION1 said they feel more awake when they go outside. @CAPS2 people are gaining weight while they could be exercising; obesity is a problem because people sit at the computer all day. @CAPS6 contributes to the @CAPS2 issue as kids have stopped participating in sports and other activities due to too much computer use. @PERCENT2 of people surveyed by the @CAPS3 newspaper stated that computer time replaces time with friends. When they see people in person, they will forget their manners because they are not used to face-to-face interaction. People who support computer usage might say that there are ways to talk online through @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. But online chatting @CAPS5't always safe; just because someone is on your buddy list @CAPS6 @MONTH1 friends out doesn't mean you know them. Unless you can see their face, you cannot be sure who they are. Computers have become too much of a distraction to society. Computers have caused people to forget how to use manners and communicate in the real world. Now is the time to get on your feet and find something else to do! Responsible townspeople are encouraged to step away from their screens and reconnect with the world around them for a healthier and more engaged community.
1393	1397	1	3	My opinion is people should go on the computer only if they really have to do something, such as type a report or check your email. What's the point of going on the computer if all you're going to do is play games? That gets boring to me. I go on the computer to talk to my friends and check email and stuff, and then I go outside to play. You should only be on the computer for @NUM1 minutes a day, then go get some exercise. If you stay on the computer all day, you will smell, get fat, get lazy, and no one wants these things. These are the things you should avoid. You can play basketball, go on a bike ride with some friends, or go swimming. I do this type of stuff every day, and I am in good shape because of it. I stay healthy and fit; I don't sit on the computer all day on a sunny day. You become more active if you go outside more; it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids. When I get home every day, I do my homework, then I go outside and play. Later, I go on the computer for @NUM1 minutes, then when @CAPS1 is done, I go to bed and do the same thing the next day. So everyone should agree with me because you know I am right about living a balanced and healthy life.
1394	1398	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Some people say that computers are fun, smart, and do no harm. Is that true though? Do computers cause harm? Well, for one thing, I know that computers can take up a lot of people's time. For example, many people don't go outside as much. This is because most people are usually on their computers. What are they doing on the computer, you ask; well, let's find out. There are many things a person can do on a computer. It can be for fun, chatting, educational purposes, or hard work. A lot of people use a computer for fun. For example, many people use the computer to chat with their friends. There are many sites to chat with friends. That can usually take up a lot of people's time. A lot of people can talk for hours on the computer, and that is what takes up their time instead of going outside. Another example is the games that people play. To me, computer games are one of the biggest problems. This is because a lot of the games can be so much fun that a person can find a game and play it all the time. This can not only take up their time outside, but it can ruin their life. The game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done. That can cause failure in school or getting fired at work. On the other side, though, a lot of people use a computer for work and school. Besides internet chatting and computer games, many people use computers for school and at work. People type their work up, or they send work to their email to bring home. This is a good thing about computers, but also a bad thing. It is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster. This is a bad thing because it is another reason to stay inside. For work, people depend on computers. They save work on them, and they use computers to build things. For example, people use a computer to program a robot. Although they use computers for a good reason, people should make time for outside. A lot of people need to take breaks off the computer because computers can do harm. This is because if they spend all their time on the computer, they can get sick. Going outside, exercising, and getting fresh air is very important. So people out there, get off your computer. Stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. Enjoy nature. Most of your day should not be spent on the computer. Thank you for your time and consideration.
1395	1399	1	3	Do you feel that computers affect you in a positive way? Well, I don't. I feel that computers have a negative effect on people. I feel this way because you won't be getting enough exercise in your life, you'll have a high light bill, and it'll begin to interfere in your everyday life. Now that I've shown my reasons, I'll define them in detailed sentences. To start my essay, I feel that people won't be getting enough exercise. I feel this because if you're on the computer all day and you don't go outside to walk or ride your bike, then you won't be burning any calories. You'll become a couch potato, which down the line can become fatal to your health. As you get older, you can possibly be diagnosed with a list of items that can be wrong with you, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart problems. Also, I feel that if you are constantly sitting in front of a computer @NUM1, then you can possibly injure your back, which can add on to the list of problems with your health due to not enough exercise. Next, I feel that if you're constantly on the computer, then your parents will have an extremely high light bill. Your parents will be upset with you and can possibly get into trouble with the light company. If you're always on the computer non-stop, before you know it, the bill will be so high you won't be able to pay it; you'll have a high light bill and can possibly be without light in your house. My personal opinion is that I don't feel computers are worth a family being left without light. Finally, I feel that computers will interfere with your everyday life. I feel this way if you're always on the computer and you're never outside, then your friends will feel like you don't want to be bothered. They'll feel like you're ignoring them, and you'll begin to lose friends that have been there for you and helped you when you needed it most. Also, computers can affect your everyday life by ruining your social life. You'll always be inside while you're missing opportunities to meet new people and build your social skills. To conclude this essay, I have brought to you my ideas and opinions about computers. I've explained to you my reasons, which are you won't be getting enough exercise, you'll have a high light bill, and it'll interfere with your everyday life. I've provided you with facts and details about the consequences of computers; now you decide whether computers have a positive or negative effect on people.
1396	1400	1	3	Would you like to be on the computer for hours and throw away your life? Well, some people already are throwing their lives away. If you spend your time on the computer you can become obese, can lose the ability of interacting with friends and family, and can even lose the ability of exploring the world!!! Its now or never to decide if you want to waste your life over a computer. If you use your computer too much you can be at risk of becoming obese. You can become obese for several reasons. You aren't exercising while you are sitting. Since you are sitting not doing anything else you start to eat a lot of snacks. Finally, another reason is that you can lose the ability to walk as well because you aren't doing anything with your legs and the obesity makes it hard to walk anymore. The time has come to decide. Also, if you waste your time on the computer you can lose the ability to interact with your family and friends. If you have children you can lose the ability to watch them grow up to adults and can even push them away. Also, you can lose your friends because they won't want to hang out with someone that's always on a computer; all that you will have will be your computer. Finally, You'll be all alone because no one will be there when you are trying to finally interact with your family. It's now or never to choose what you want to do with your life. Finally, while your on the computer checking your myspace or your face-book there's a bunch of things happening around the world. Instead of looking through your hard drive you could be looking over the Golden Gate Bridge or looking at the Eiffel tower in Paris or finally even going to Disneyland in Florida! with your family. The time has come to decide. As a conclusion, wasting your life on the computer is bad and can hurt your life in many ways. It can make you obese and take the ability to walk away from you. It could prevent you from spending time with family and friends and can even push them away. Finally you can waste your time at home and not explore the world. The time has come to decide if you want to waste your time or not; my opinion is no!!!
1397	1401	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I'm sure you love kicking back and surfing the web. After all, the internet is an amazing invention. However, the truth of the matter is that some people spend way too much time on the computer. We miss out on all the other important things in life, just because of too much time on our laptops. Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise. It can cause us to be anti-social, and lastly, not allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know what a very high cause of obesity is? Electronics; kids sit on the computer all day long, while they should be out exercising and keeping fit. Sure, it is still okay to surf the web. You just have to keep the time minimum; we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home. I myself love to use the computer, but I make sure to get off after about an hour. The whole idea of the ""internet"" is such a broad topic that leaves us with so much to explore, we just have to keep an eye on the clock. There are so many forms of chat on the internet; Facebook, Twitter, etc. Many people are always on one of those, instead of talking in person. We can eventually become anti-social due to so much time spent on the computer. Although yes, you can be talking over the internet, it is necessary to be talking to people face to face, it is as if we become glued to the computer. Websites such as Instagram and TikTok are also causes of this. People get addicted and are on them constantly; social media websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So instead of having a chat over the computer screen, plan a meeting in person. Don't allow the computer to let you lose the social skills that you have built up. I love going outside each season to see the beautiful nature that surrounds us; if you spend too much time on the computer, you won't have time to enjoy it. There are so many things that you would be missing out on. Take time out of your day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside. Things outside are so much prettier than your computer screen, trust me. Once you cut down your computer time little-by-little, you will realize all the other things that are more worth your time. So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game, I hope you think about my opinions I presented to you. Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise, and we can become anti-social. We won't be able to enjoy the nature around us. Computer time is fine in moderation, you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it. Hopefully, my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web."
1398	1402	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are both a good and a bad thing. Computers allow us to play games, and learn about almost anything. But computers cannot simulate fresh air and exercise. Computers allow people to play a wide variety of games. People can play chess, solitaire, and a great deal of other games like that. Computers also allow us to play a very wide variety of online games. I can think of at least three different sites that have online games, each site having at least fifty different games! Hundreds of thousands of people play online games everyday! What would they do if we didn't have the computer to play those games? We can also search any topic from a computer anywhere. This is an amazing thing to be able to do. Imagine if nobody had a computer; how would we research so much of our knowledge? Yes there are libraries, but using a computer is so much faster. Plus you can print things out on a computer; with a book you have to copy important information down, though you can highlight the important parts. No matter how much computers do, they may be the reason kids are getting bigger and bigger all because they sit for so long. Computers are amazing and society benefits from them by a lot. But just like everything, computers have their downside. So please inform adults and kids about the goodness of computers, but also warn them about the bad things that could happen if you spend too much time on the computer and not enough outside.
1399	1403	1	3	"Have you ever gone on the computer? Have you ever sat there on the computer for a long time? I am writing you because I am concerned with the health of the town. Many people have computers and go on them daily. It may be fun, but it could also hurt your health. Computers can be addicting and cause us to play for hours. Many people do not exercise at all anymore. Most are too busy on their computer. You should have at least sixty minutes of exercise each day. ""Active kids should have anywhere from sixty minutes of exercise on average per day. A lot of kids are now playing video games on the computers for that time instead of exercising,"" says Dr. Sereno. Many kids don't go outside enough either. Did you know you should have a minimum of thirty minutes in sunlight each day? You get most of your vitamins from the sun. When was the last time you took a bike ride, went camping, or went to the beach? All are very fun things to do that you could be missing out on because of the computer. I know I absolutely love going to the beach. Hearing the waves, laughing by the ocean waters, and feeling its cool spray is just heaven. If I was on the computer all the time I would not be able to enjoy that. My most important question is, do you like having fun or going out with your family? I believe computer conversations don't feel the same as being with the person. Can you imagine never actually seeing or hearing the person you're talking to? That's how it is with texting. A large percentage of communication is now done online, but wouldn't you rather talk to the person on the phone or talk face to face? I feel people should spend time exercising, going outdoors, and spending time with friends and family. Remember sixty minutes of exercise, thirty minutes in the sun each day to stay really healthy. Please consider this and write an article to improve the town's social and overall health. Its up to you!"
1400	1404	1	3	Readers, imagine a world without computers. Communication would be slower, schoolwork would be far more difficult and we'd lose a source that generates tons of fun. Do you really want a world like that? The pros of computers definitely outweigh the cons. For example, computers make world communication way better thanks to tools like email, instant messaging, and video conferencing. Computers also make learning for school easier and allow you to work more efficiently. Lastly, computers make the world a much more entertaining and fun place thanks to YouTube, news and online movies/tv shows. The effect of computers is definitely positive on society. With one click a message can be sent to anywhere in the world. How great is that? Because of computers people not only email each other but we can even have live chats through text or videos; online communication is a great help in my life, and the lives of my peers. For example, whenever I forget homework or have questions about schoolwork I can reach my peers and get help in a matter of minutes. Not only can I seek help from others on my computer but I can stay in touch with my friends and family. So those who think computers cause us to spend less time with family and friends are mistaken. Computers link the world together and greatly advance communication positively. Aside from communication, computers also greatly improve education and learning in many ways. For example, they make it so that projects and assignments can be done faster and easier thanks to programs like Microsoft Word. It's proven that students who use computers for schoolwork find that they make learning easier as well. Online encyclopedias help students all over the world with schoolwork or just learning for fun at home. Another way that computers improve education is through online tutors and help sites. Computers have made it so you're basically always within minutes of a teacher. I can't imagine completing any assignment without a computer on my desk. Computers are not only practical for school and communication but they're also a great way to spend time having fun. One source of fun on the computer is online movies and tv shows. Thanks to them you can always stay caught up with the latest episodes of your favorite show. Online gaming also brings joy to people all over the world; you can spend hours playing live with others in detailed three-dimensional worlds! Computers also enable you to kick back and laugh at historical videos on YouTube. Lastly computers make browsing all the latest news a breeze. You will always know what's going on in the world, thanks to your computers. So whether you enjoy chilling and watching videos, playing games or reading up on the news you will always find a way to have fun online! What's not to like? With such a positive effect on the world, computers are definitely amazing technology; you can communicate with friends or family online in an instant, work on your school assignments, learn something new or simply have a great time! We hope you see how computers make life better and much easier.
1401	1405	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have heard that some people do not agree that computers benefit our society. Well, in this letter I am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society. Those reasons are that people have friends and family in other states, some people use them to stay organized, and computers help you learn more. I hope that by the end of this letter you will see that computers do benefit our society. First of all, I think that computers benefit our society because email lets people stay in contact with family and friends in other states. This is true that you could use the phone and call them out, but you have to pay for long distance. You don't have to pay anything to email somebody. I know from experience because I have friends and family in a lot of states in the country. ""Computers help me stay in contact with my family all over,"" said a user from a major tech company. Indeed, many people use the computer to contact loved ones every day. Some people even use them to stay in touch with family who are at war. Next, I believe that computers benefit society because software keeps people organized. I know this may not seem like a big deal, but a lot of people use computers to keep things organized so they know how everything is. What would happen if we didn't have computers to track all of the appointments? Well, I will tell you what would happen: appointments would be missed, and you might end up getting things you already have. ""I keep my schedule on my computer,"" said one professional. And finally, I strongly believe that computers benefit our society because they help people learn more. Yes, it is right that not everybody goes on the computers to learn, but that doesn't mean they don't learn. Here's a couple of examples: one is a music site that lets you learn song lyrics, dance moves, and more. Another is a social site that lets you learn what other people like, don't like, and so on. Then there is Facebook, which lets you see what people are doing that day. ""People learn everything on the computer,"" stated a noted educator. Now I hope you see that computers do benefit our society, and if you think they don't, that is your opinion. I hope you see what I see now."
1402	1406	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion computers have a good effect on people because people can communicate with each other, learn on the computer, and mostly people can shop online. Overall I think computers have a positive effect on people. Wow! Finally got to chat with my cousin from California. Communicating on the computer is great because you save money since you don't have to pay a phone bill. Also, most companies use email to chat between co-workers. Dr. Smith, a scientist, says co-workers who communicate are actually safer because they don't have to travel anywhere and they can stay home. Today there are so many social networking sites; people can improve their mental health and boost their self-esteem by talking to people on a daily basis. Lastly, all this communicating is great because you don't have to travel to communicate with someone, making the world more eco-friendly. Wow! There are over a million information sites on the computer. On the computer you can also use programs to make graphs and tables to show data. Mrs. Can says if you show information on the computer using graphs, you will increase how much you know by fifty percent. Another great thing is that in order to learn you don't have to read books, which saves paper, and many of the databases with information are free so you save money; also, it takes only seconds to find information you want. On average it takes thirty seconds to find information. Finally, the computer is a great place to find information and enlighten yourself. Shopping on the computer, that must be impossible? Not with today's computers. Shopping on the computer is great because you save time not having to travel to the store. Consumer Reports says you can save twenty percent of the cost of the product if you buy online because over a thousand stores have online sales. With the technology we have today, you can compare prices of an item by visiting a website and clicking a button; then you don't have to spend extra going to both stores. Online product reviews have become very popular because you can hear other people's opinions about the product. In the end, online shopping is great because you can save money, compare prices, and find many great things. In conclusion, computers have helped a lot of people because you can shop online, communicate, and learn; overall, computers have really changed lives for most citizens.
1403	1407	1	3	Dear Editor, Computers are a great invention! They allow you to do so many different things. They have a lot of positive effects on people. Computers deal with all sorts of things, from hand-eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, to talking online with anyone. Come on in to the wonderful world of computers. Computers have a super positive effect on people. They help teach hand-eye coordination. You can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse. You can see where it's going just by looking at the screen. Doing this helps everyday skills like playing sports. If you can use your eyes and your hands at once, you can hit a baseball or even catch a ball. Computers teach hand-eye coordination by being able to do two things at the same time. Wouldn't it be amazing if you could just find a recipe to go to? Well, you could simply use a computer. A computer helps people learn different things. It's also easy to learn about different cultures, people, and places. Let's say you want to learn about another country; a computer gives you the ability to learn something new. People use computers almost every day. They give you access to communication tools. For instance, instant messaging is a great way to talk to people. You can chat with people by typing. Furthermore, sites like social networks, blogs, or forums are places where you have your own page to post your own opinions. You also have a friends page to see how you are doing. These sites give people a chance to reconnect with old friends. Webcam is becoming a huge sensation! Sites like Skype let you see and talk to the other person. They allow you to talk to people that you miss and feel that they are there with you. Computers benefit people all over the world, but that doesn't mean they are taking over; they are only helping them improve their lives.
1404	1408	1	3	"Dear School Board, Our school has a lot of technology including the biggest hit, the computer. I say that computers have a more positive effect on people. Some reasons include that computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even give you the ability to talk online with other people. Where would we be without computers? First of all, computers teach hand-eye coordination. People that type slower usually have poorer hand-eye coordination. Of course with faster typists, they have better hand-eye coordination. Ninety percent of people including teachers agree with this. Is this why our school is typing ""lessons"" in computer classes in elementary school? The answer is most likely going to be a yes. Second of all, computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. Computers give you more resources than a book. Using the computer to go on multiple websites is actually easier. Using these websites, people can have a higher education. One teacher said, ""using websites is so much easier for everyone. Using them for homework and having the students take notes is a lot less difficult."" And to that I agree entirely. Finally, computers give people the ability to talk to other people online. Using things like social media, chat programs, email, and video chat. All of these, and more, give you the opportunity to chat with friends living far away. That way friendships are never really lost. People never want to lose relationships. Losing one can be very sad. I know this from personal experience. In conclusion, this is why I think that computers are a positive effect on people. From learning to chatting, computers are a great way to chat with friends and even do homework. Hand-eye coordination included. All of these are positive effects, don't you think? I think so and this is why I believe that computers are a more positive effect than a negative effect on people."
1405	1409	1	3	I believe that computers make everyday work easier to do. Computers allow someone from a faraway place to talk to another person who they can’t see in person; they allow you to get work done in a quicker manner and get a college education without leaving your home. Imagine that you have a relative who lives a great deal of miles away from you and it’s too expensive to call or fly over there. Computers enable us to communicate with them through email or video chat without the hefty price. Because of computers, talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away. Getting work done can sometimes feel like another chore. Computers only make doing your work easier and faster. Would you rather sit and write out a term paper for hours or type it up and email it to your professor in half the amount of time? College students find that computers help them work more efficiently than writing by hand. Computers are a way to reduce the burdens of work. Education is a need for all, but what if the college that you want to attend is too far from home and you can’t afford to move? Thankfully, online college courses are available. If it wasn’t for this source of technology, you would be left to do what? Online courses allow an eager student to learn without breaking their bank or leaving their child if they are parents. Without computers, many people would not be able to get the education that they have a right to. Computers have allowed us to communicate with our family that live somewhere we can’t afford to travel to. These technological devices have enabled us to get our work done in a timely manner to receive the grade that we deserve. Computers have allowed over a million citizens to get their education right in their home at a price they can afford. Without this gadget, we would not be able to live the life we have today, a life that can get us to where we need to be.
1406	1410	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, The use of computers is not beneficial to our society. I fear that many kids will suffer from childhood obesity, this is because of the inactiveness of so many teenagers my age. They @CAPS1 could be enjoying life outdoors and staying active, but they choose to sit in front of a screen all day, every day. Researchers have proven inactiveness is at large due to many Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter users. These websites are nothing but trouble; other than being unhealthy, teenagers all over are being cyber bullied, sometimes to the verge of suicide. Many are not aware of the several pedophiles and creepos these sites carry, which can lead to abduction, rape, or worse. By staying active and being outdoors with your friends, you could save yourself from these dangers. Go outside, run a little; you would be amazed how much a little exercise can help you. Also, I firmly believe time should be spent with your family, doing family activities and eating dinner with your parents. By doing this, you become closer as a family, and it could help you make healthier choices and keep exercising. I believe by following these simple steps—staying active, staying off the computer, and spending time with the family—is much more beneficial than learning how to type or talking to your friends online. Using the computer leads to cyber bullying and dangerous people, whereas living healthy is the way to be a happier and safer person.
1407	1411	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about computers? I know that I think they are a great thing and we are lucky to have them. They have to be used in moderation though, because exercise and staying healthy is good. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help persuade readers on my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers is that they are a great source to learn. The internet can connect you all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures. You can know everything about a country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about your family's history. Many record-keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to @LOCATION1, they had databases there that had every name of the people that went through there. Studies show that @NUM1 people find the internet easy to use, and quicker than any other method. Another thing about computers is they help you in the workplace. Let's say you had a job designing houses to be built. In old times you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you could make the design using just one tool, the computer. It is a much easier way to do your job and it assists the customers because before if they wanted the house to be different, you would have to draw it all over again. Now you just have to make an adjustment on the computer and in seconds it's done with the new design. These days if not @PERCENT2 then @PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play a social role. On the internet you can connect and chat with friends. Also, you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting hit with a soccer ball. Experts did a study and it showed that @NUM2 times the reason a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer) what do you think the number one reason teens use computers is?"" @CAPS3, ""I would have to say to chat with friends. I don't see why they wouldn't, it's simple and almost instant."" Computers are a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be overused though, and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the things we could learn from them help in the argument for that. To me, the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer sources found @PERCENT3 of homes in @LOCATION2 have them, and I believe they will be in all of our homes. Some families find them @CAPS2 useful and have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sizes to fit your wants and needs, and can connect you to anything in the world, making life more convenient and informed."
1408	1412	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Readers, Some of you might think people exercise computers. They don't act outside enough or interact with family or pets. You also @MONTH1 think that they are not getting enough exercise. Well, you are right, but I am going to explain why you're wrong. You can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. The first thing you could do is learn. While you are on the internet you can go to learning websites. Some of those websites can teach you about faraway places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 for example; you could learn their culture and the @CAPS5 they celebrate and why. Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. Another thing you could do on the computer is socialize. You might think or say that when you are on the computer you can't socialize with family and friends. Well, you can. There are websites like @CAPS6 and Facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now you can webcam people. When you webcam, you can see the person whom you are talking to; you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam. Lastly, you could go into chatrooms like @CAPS7 (AOL instant message) and talk to people while you are on that site. The last thing you can do is become more healthy. Is it not surprising? Yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1's esang.com can give you a nightly eating schedule right for your needs. After that website, you could go out and get the items you will need. Another thing that the computer offers is hand-eye coordination. While you are looking at the screen, your hand is controlling the ""mouse,"" while the mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. Lastly, you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you monuments and gardens of this world. So now, hopefully, you agree with me that computers do actually benefit some things in life. I have showed you what you can learn about, how to talk to people and socialize, and lastly, how they can help you with your health, proving they are a valuable tool when used correctly."
1409	1413	1	3	Computers have definitely had an impact on society that changed the world. People and life are now smarter, quicker, faster, and easier. People who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant, for free. But what effect does this have on people? Something this big and having such a long history can't be good for some people. I don't think for some people it is. To start with basics, some people get too obsessed with computers. If they have life problems then they @MONTH1 seek the solitude and privacy of unfiltered and limitless internet. Even if you use a computer to chat with people, it still is no replacement for the real thing. In fact, studies show that due to non-personal ways of communicating such as text messaging, email, or chat rooms, can severely restrict a person's way of connecting with other people. Don't get me wrong here. I do use sites such as Facebook to talk to people. So, I'm not going to state that online talk is bad. I think it's a very good way of keeping in touch with people you can't talk to in real life. And, it's a good way to help friends and be there for them. It's best done in moderation though. Getting information from the computer is very debatable. Some could say that the people being informed is a good thing, which I agree with. Some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant. I also agree with that. I would also say knowing some things are good, but be careful of knowing too much. One area I find computers to be great in is originality. In a world where we are raised to kill creativity, I find computers to be part artistic, in a way. It's personally helped me to discover what kind of music, drawings, creations, etc. that I like. I can also share what I've made so everyone can see it, or listen to it, or try it for themselves. In conclusion, I think computers are a great tool for use in moderation. For some people who are obsessed, it can be problematic, but I think they are a great addition to society that, when used wisely, enhances our lives.
1410	1414	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table in our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in that location would sit on the floor. Surely, computers allow you to connect; @CAPS2 my cousin on the computer and @CAPS3 it is important to note that, on computers you can play games that can help you with your school-work. You can go on sites that you find on your @CAPS4. They show you how your body works for @CAPS5, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are not boring; this is a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didn't. The time is now to recognize these benefits! Just think that while people are spending time on their computers, they are also learning and connecting, and there will always be time for exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, making computers a valuable part of a balanced life.
1411	1415	1	3	Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. They arenít communicating with any of their friends, and arenít really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps. This would happen @CAPS5 we banned computers! Computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. My close friend @PERSON1 told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, and doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didnít have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. This statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. Also a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didnt have computers, half of the worldís discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well. Childrenís specialist @PERSON3 says, ì@CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports.î @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. Clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. Lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate everyday. We wouldnít want to deny them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didnít have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4 a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5 says that when people donít have computers & canít communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they donít talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this. The same family as before is sitting in bright, sunny room their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys calls out, ìhey, look at his ì and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they build hand eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now & learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!
1412	1416	1	3	The advancements of technology has developed so much that it has become comenly known to us as a normal house hold such as we use it every day at work, home, schools, bussneses it has become a comen used item in the everyday life.

And this is why computers are needed in this society to use every day and thier comenly used and that are requirded for our modern way of life.
1413	1417	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has made great improvements in the past years. Computers have now found a home in all most every buisness and home in @LOCATION1! Everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined and peole should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning? Name the fatest country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? The answer to all @ORGANIZATION1 those questions is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies done by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. @ORGANIZATION1 those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are over weight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function and helps burn off unnessecary calories. People most definately need to get off the computer and exercise more. They might even like it. Spending time with your family can be great fun, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school,"" @CAPS4 @PERSON2 beyond. So what's stopping them?, Computers. Kids now find many internet sites online online more interesting than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn @ORGANIZATION1 the computers, bring out the board games and keep @CAPS5 families together! ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have,"" @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS6 wasting money on? You guessed it; computers. The average bill per month is @MONEY2. In a whole year your paying @MONEY1 for something you don't need! Computers also waste space. Along with needing a place to house your monitor, you have to find room to cram a printer, the hardrive AND all those wires. Who can find enough room?! I certainly can't. Although technology, namely computers, can be a wonderful thing, we need to look at the downside. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart and the economy collapses, all because @ORGANIZATION1 computers. We need to stop the problems and turn off the computers before it is too late."
1414	1418	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I am writing to you @DATE1 because think computers really effect people in a bad way. I say this becuause @CAPS1 you go on the internet you do not get that much excirse. You also don't get good grades at all! That's bad thing. Plus when on a computer there are some really wierd people. I really want you guys to hear out my story. Go outside! @CAPS3 mom I'm on the computer! @CAPS1 your on the computer to much you want want to get exersce. @CAPS1 you don't get excise you won't be healthy! you want get excise. Also you will obese you don't want that! For instance when your in gym class you want to be healthy. So you can and you will get a good grade. Do you want a bad grades? That sums it up on. You got an @CAPS2! On your report card? When you spend alot of your time on a computer then you will get addicted. @CAPS1 you get addicted then you will not do your homework then your grades will drop. You will get bad grades in school. Then you have a possibilty to stay back. Plus then the parents to flipout on. This is one of my reasons why computers effect people in a bad way! When you go on the computer you have @CAPS3 clue who you are talking to unless your thier friends. There has been very many cases that kids getting stolen because of facebook and myspace. @CAPS1 your kid goes on those websites than your kids' always at danger! There are cyber and they could find out where you live that information about you. For instance there was a case on myspace that a kid thought she was talking to a @NUM1 year old boy she was really talking to a @NUM2 something year old guy. Then the girl went missing for about weeks. That was. So you can never trust a computer. When you take a real good look at computers you will see they are just @CAPS3 good. All my reasons before. They are you will not get nearly the amount of you are supose to. Your grade will plummet down @CAPS1 you stay on the computer and they trick you. So even know you can communicate with your friends. Its just not worth it for all the bad things that can happen.
1415	1419	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not excersizing. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average familly had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average familly has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then, because people are almost always on the computer, rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technologie has hur t our nation, is that there is an immence lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the parents should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exeed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their-heads with nonesence. Now, computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull, but do children use them that way? The answer in no, and, ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults"", state @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations. If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer-drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health and ensure a better future."
1416	1420	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society. @CAPS2 can have its positive effect on people, but too much of @CAPS2 isn't a good thing. This is why I want to tell everyone about negative effects of the computer on people. We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things. They can help with business, interacting with family and friends, and you could even just use @CAPS2 for entertainment. Some negative effects that some people don't know, or maybe just ignore, are things like they can keep you from exercising, exploring nature, and you could spend so much time on your computer, that you could get addicted, leading to a more sedentary and isolated lifestyle. There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern. So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising. Maybe we could tell people that they can use their computers to contact people like friends and family to go out and make plans to exercise and have fun outside so theyre not stuck on the computer all day. We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places and people in the world, and so much more. They also have bad effects, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from people. And you shouldn't be outside all the time, for the whole day. So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day. This way, people get what they want, and they have some time off of @CAPS2, too, which would be beneficial for their overall health and well-being. Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern. I hope I have persuaded you with my well-thought out thoughts and ideas. And hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society.
1417	1421	1	3	"How does the computer effect people? @CAPS1 there are way's that computer's can be really bad and really good"", they're good. Because people who dont like writing usually just have a computer to type on. But people rarely do that, parent's and kid's stay on the computer not caring about nothing else but the screen the kid's stay up all night knowing they have school they dont even do their homework, which negatively impacts their grades and health. I have proof my freind's, research show's, my mother also agree's. I suggest that you will agree on my opinion'. @PERCENT1 of my freind's agree with me because they have been through this, and they would'nt wake up to go to school. Dr @PERSON1's of @ORGANIZATION1 researched how parent's hardly spend time with their family. For example father's they basically always on the computer either working or looking up stuff, which means they miss out on important family moments. My mom say's that when she was younger she loved the internent. She never wanted to get off, and she saw how it could pull people away from real life. @CAPS1 i hope youv enjoyed my opinion', thank's for even taking this time to read it. Thank's again."
1418	1422	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is your opinion on computers? Are they good or bad? Computers, have not been around that long but it is contrivertal wiether it has a positive or negative effect. True they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous. I believe computer are not a neccesity to people. Computers are uneeded because people spend way to much time on them, then we begin lack exercise, and they become hazardous to everyone. First, computers are not a neccesity because people send way to much time on them. Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour -and-a-half the computer will start to effect you in negative ways. For one your eyes will begin to hurt. If you stay on longer than that you will start to get a head-ach. Soon your head-ach wil turn so bad you cant bare it. It will pound and feel as if its on fire. This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and @CAPS2 your reading or seeing at the same time. Most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest. Sometimes you don't get off till they have a stomach-ach too. After they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process. This is why, computer are an obstruction to us. Next, people begin to lose exercise. After being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computer have deprived everyone of the outside. They don't want to go out and get exercise and play around. Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing, obysity. Soon you will become fat. Life will become tough. And being fat also has a negative effect. For one you cannot run very long, you become weak, and for kids you stop growing. But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So you see computers are a nucence to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the envirnment. There are @NUM1 billion people in the world. At anytime about @NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan. Now, have you ever thought were this heat goes. Well, it makes holes in the ozon layer and causes global warning. The ozon layer is the only thing keeping the sun's ultra-violent rays from scorting us. Now if everytime some turns on a computer @NUM3 of the ozon layer disapeared and @NUM2 billion people are on that would be @NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere. Now think about global warming. If the ozon layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the @CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise. The @CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth. Do you reall want that. Eventually we would drown and life would seece to exist. As you can see computer are a nucents. They hypnotize the young children and adults. They be helpful but more hazardous. Sometimes we don't even relize this. Computers are bad because people spent to much time on them, people lose exercise, and they are hazardous to us and our planet.
1419	1423	1	3	People often say that computers and technology are bad for you, but yet i think they have helped our society out very well. Computers help people through there trouble. Computers make our lives easier. By, when you buy things now there are computers adding and subtracting your amounts, They help people find out where to go, And last but not least they help friends and family stay in tuch with each other. With out computers we would have to wait in longer lines for what we want to buy. For instince stop & shop they have computers to check out people and the lines are already long enough. If we had no computers the lines would be even longer because then the people would have to add up the money by hand, which is a much slower process. Also with out computers you would not be able to weigh you good as fast as we do now in grosery stores we would have to hand weigh it. With out computer days at the grorsury stores would be very long. Without computers you would not have @CAPS1 and places online that give you directions. You would have to have use the bid maps driving to places. Those mapes could get lost wile you are driving. You can lose yout spot, And some times you @MONTH1 mark out the wrong spots on you map. With computers you can have @CAPS1, Online directions that can tell you the fastest and easest way to get to your place. Also with computers it saves papers on maps and we do not wast as much trees. Have you ever been in the situation were you want to go visit your family member out of state but you just dont have the money? well many people have and now insted of waisting (the money they dont have). They can video chat, talk, look at peoples pitchers and keep updated with them on the computer. You do not need to spend tons of money on it, it is all free, they are social networking sites. That people use to keep in tuch with family and friends. Those sites you have to use on. the computer so with out computers you would have to travel in a car waste money and the air with your car. In conclution i think computers have helped out society out very well by making daily tasks more efficient and keeping people connected.
1420	1424	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I belive that computers benefits the people of today. The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had recived information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to comunicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remeber my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the country. Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2-obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and excersising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they myt entertain themselves indeers. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privleges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormouse benifits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students whith school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside. I hope that this letter had convinced you of the benefits of computers for communication, education, and entertainment.
1421	1425	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers have been here for a while now and taking them away would be like forgetting all the progress we made in technology. Computers are everywhere; in fact, seven out of ten families on my street own at least one computer in their household. So why would we want to take them away? Computers are too useful. They are not only fun, but very resourceful. Anybody with a question could easily hop on a computer, research it on google.com, and find what they were looking for within minutes. I remember when I had a cut on my arm that looked weird, my mom was able to learn how to heal a wound. She researched it and got information on how to make the mark go away. The computer only benefits you in a positive way. It is most likely that you'll be staying at a place in two weeks and realize they don't have a pool! Lastly, without computers we would have no communication with new or different people. Computers are great for communicating. People are able to communicate through Twitter, @CAPS2, and even YouTube. These sites all help people make new friends online, almost like pen pals on the internet. Also, if the majority of your family lived in @LOCATION1 and you were stuck in @CAPS3, you could easily talk to them through email or an instant messenger. Hopefully now you have a better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is. Maybe you could even make your next @STATE1 post about how resourceful, beneficial, and social computers are!
1422	1426	1	3	To whom it may concern, The @NUM1's were the beginning of a new age; computers had just come out and were mesmerizing people with their intellect. But now more and more people think it’s a waste of time. I, for one, do not think this, and within these lines you will see my opinion take shape for the following reasons: it's an information highway, it lets artists expand their craft, and engineers are now able to plan buildings and bridges on their computers. Thanks to the internet, students and people gain knowledge each day; the internet is essential for people writing an essay. In fact, the superintendent of schools in @LOCATION1 has stated that over @PERCENT1 of students will use the internet to help them write an essay. We also don't have to go to the library anywhere to do research because we have a whole library of information at our house—the computer. Another thing is that people are now able to communicate all over the world, which will allow us to learn about other cultures straight from the source. Artists are now able to do things that were impossible before; a new art form of video games has come out, allowing artists to express themselves. Do you like to express yourself? Music mixing has become my hobby and it is done over the computer. You can add additional tracks and lapse other tracks; you don't have to use a typing machine anymore, you can just jump on the computer and type on a keyboard. You can use spell check and the undo function instead of having to throw away an idea that you didn't like. Artists have been greatly helped by computers. And lastly, engineers are now able to plan out how a building or bridge might look, which also applies to video game making. @CAPS2 can make the house of their dreams. When you plan buildings and bridges on a computer you can run simulations, which makes them stronger before you even start building them. With the new software available today, you can see how certain structures would hold up under natural disasters so you can pick the design that has the best ability to withstand them. I hope you can see using your own eyes and agree that computers are truly an amazing tool that lets us get information and also helps us create.
1423	1427	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and was a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups, etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example, when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of information was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordination, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone. Furthermore, the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy,"" says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings going on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. We, @CAPS7 citizens, want to know everything for us to stay safe and notified on the latest news. Another example is that I logged on the computer three days ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone to read."
1424	1428	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers do benefit society because computers can do a lot of things like teach you. Computers are very helpful now; mostly everything gets done on them. The computer teaches good eye coordination, how to focus, and shows you stuff you don't know about. Without a computer you really can't get anything done or ready. A computer can be helpful for lots of things like job applications or taxes, or at a grocery store register. Typing and being on the computer is a form of exercising, but not for your body. When you're on a computer you exercise your hands and your brain. Without computers you really can't do many things. Mostly everything you do in life has to deal with some type of computer. I think that the people that said they shouldn't be on the computer are wrong because they can interact with their family that's far away that is also online. You can enjoy nature by just taking a look at old pictures; you don't have to walk outside. That's why I think computers are positive and helpful tools in our daily lives.
1425	1429	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world, and you can even shop online. Being without contact with your loved ones is sad, but if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friend in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2, you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can see what other people are doing or play games with them. If you are on Facebook or Myspace you can add people as your friends so you can connect with them. Shopping online is faster and quicker than shopping at a store. A benefit is that if you are shopping for clothes and there's a long line, you'll start to get impatient; that's why there is online shopping so that we can avoid that. You can find what you need from home. In conclusion, the computer is a very useful thing. You can talk to your relatives from @LOCATION2 and you can go shopping without waiting in line. The computer allows you to talk to other people around the world.
1426	1430	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, do you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, I would say that computers have negative effects on us. This is because we would get less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. If you're on the computer most of the time at home, how would you get your exercise? You wouldn't because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop. This is also a problem because this is how obesity can occur from no exercise, and just sitting all day. Or people who have heart problems and need exercise can worsen their condition by being distracted by the computer. Being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature. Instead of going outside in the warm weather, having fun, people are staying home. This is not good because they should be out having fun, not on the computer all day. Missing time with family and friends is unacceptable when you're on the computer. This is because you're supposed to keep your family and friends company and not daze off on what you're doing on the computer. Also you miss family gatherings or leave your friends lonely. That's because you're too busy on the computer and not paying attention to anyone around you. This is why I think computers have a negative effect on people, primarily due to the reduction in physical activity, the loss of opportunities to appreciate the natural world, and the diminished quality of interactions with family and friends.
1427	1431	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, Technology is an ever evolving thing and more and more people are using it. With more people making use of computers, the more technology benefits our society. Through the use of computers people will be taught hand-eye coordination, be presented with the ability to become educated on distant places, and also allow people to talk online with other people. Through the use of computers people will be taught hand-eye coordination. An effective skill to learn would be hand-eye coordination, the benefits of this would be outstanding. Having great coordination would mean that person would exceed past anybody who does not use computers. Advanced coordination would mean that person would be able to accomplish more things like fast typing or precise mouse control. Finally better hand-eye coordination means that person will be more likely to obtain a job in a field that needs good coordination, such as graphic design or surgery. These developed skills demonstrate the positive impact computers can have on an individual's capabilities and future opportunities.
1428	1432	1	3	The Local Town Newspaper just found out that there is a big argument going on saying that computers are not benefiting society. The other side, those who support advances in technology, believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Well the Local Town had to choose a side and the side that they have chosen is that computers have a positive affect on people. You know why we pick this side because there are three reasons why computers are good. Like number one they teach people about far away places and people, secondly computers are a good source of entertainment, and last but not least thirdly computers are good for chat rooms. When Local Town Newspaper are finished telling you why these three reason are good the people's use of computer will win this war! First reason is do you like wasting time walking though the library looking for places or famous people. Well if you have a computer you do not have to deal with these all you have to do is go to search and put this person or place name and you will see that in less than a min you have information that will take hours to find in a library. I know this because it happen to me looking for a book that talks about the Mayan calendars. I could not find it so I had to go on a computer for the information. Secound reason why because computers are a good source of entertainment. You know if you got bored and you have computer you can easily just go on it and play so many fun games like Solitaire, Minecraft, dragonwars, or any fun game that you can find on a computer. There are so many games to choose from that you will never get bored. Third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family. Like there are so many sites that you can choose to talk to friend or family like Facebook, Skype or even email. Also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family. So go on a computers and talk to your friend even send that person a picture or something. My conclusion is I hope you take what I said to heart and choose what the newspaper have as a decision, recognizing the clear benefits that computers bring to learning, leisure, and communication.
1429	1433	1	3	Dear local newspaper I think that the effects that computers have on people are that some people become very addictive to them, because some people spend a lot of time in the computer doing nothing productive, as they just spend their money buying things that they don't need. I also think that computers affect people in the way that they don't spend a lot of time with their family. The effects that computers have on people is that some people can't stop using them even if they want to. People become very addictive to computers because they spend almost all their time in there. People don't exercise no more because they spend all their time on the computer, shopping for things that they don't need; they just buy them because they like them. The effects that computers have on people are that some people just want to be talking to their friend on myspace or Facebook and other websites that are not good for them. I think that the effects that computers have on people are that they take away people's time because some people spend a lot of time on the computers, leaving their family's alone without spending time with them. Computers take away peoples time because they don't spend time exercising or playing out side with friends or brothers or go to a park to spend some time with their family or have a contact with family and invite some friends to come over to have some good time instead of being in the computer all day without doing nothing. Computer's take away time or love for your family and they make you spend the time that you don't have. The effect's that computers have on people are bad because people can't stop using them even if they wanted to because they are all ready addictive to them. People can't stop using them because in the computers you could do lots of things like shopping, talk to friends and visit websites that have very interesting things from other countries that are very beautiful but some people can't stop using them because they go to play games or because they are down loading music from websites that they don't have to. In conclusion i think that the effects that computers have on people are very bad because some people spend a lot of time on them and they even spend the time that they don't have and the time they need for healthier pursuits. I also think that computers affect people because they don't spend time with their family sharing good things. The effects that computers also have are that people can't stop using them because they are addictive to them, which ultimately harms their personal well-being and family relationships.
1430	1434	1	3	Did you know that a large percentage of people use their computers extremely often? Not many people don't have a computer these days and sometimes it's hard to get away from it. I think most people can control themselves, though I believe that computers are very important and also have a positive effect on people. I use the computer to talk with friends and family, to help with my homework, and I am still active. I spend quite a bit of time on the computer, yet I am still a very active person. I take dance lessons twice a week and when I can, I ride my bike, play outside, or run on the treadmill. I would say that I am a very healthy person. It may seem like I am on a lot, but really I have a good balance. Also, all my friends are on the computer and some of them are more active then me. Most people spend lots of time on the computer and are still healthy and busy with other activities. I would definitely say that I interact with my family quite a bit. In a family setting it is kind of hard not to. Also, I hang out with my friends every chance I get. I interact a lot but the computer lets me talk to them when they're not around. Most of my extended family lives far away. The computer lets me communicate with them and even exchange digital pictures. Sometimes your friends, this has happened to me before, and I were too busy to get together or it was snowing and my parents couldn't drive. We still got to talk and have a nice conversation. Some people have to be on the computer all day; my mom keeps the books and managers many things for a company. She spends a lot of time on the computer whether she likes it or not. This really cannot be helped. Sometimes it is just necessary. Also, teachers use it to help them teach classes and prepare materials for it. As a result, I use it for homework. I often need to check my homework, research a topic, or use it for help. I think the computer is absolutely necessary and is a very irreplaceable piece of modern technology. I'm sure you will now agree that computers are helpful, not harmful. As long as you get equal amounts of fresh air and family interaction, they have a very positive effect on people's lives by enhancing communication, education, and work efficiency.
1431	1435	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A recent survey said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors think the advances we have made with technology and computers is helping us rather than hurting us. I agree that computers are having a positive impact on us. Advances in technology are helping us become more efficiant in our daily tasks and professional duties. Computers also give us the ability to research places and things we @MONTH1 never get the opportunity to see in person, such as historical landmarks or deep-sea ecosystems. We are also able to talk online with other people who we might have not met otherwise, expanding our social and professional networks. The most important, though, is our advances in technology. Recently on the news I saw a segment of how at @ORGANIZATION2 they are using robots to make surgery more efficient and precise. This also means that there are smaller incisions being made, so that means a faster recovery and less pain for the patient. Another part of society that has been advancing is crime solving. Before there were computers, there was no blood testing, no fingerprinting, and most likely no x-rays, making investigations much slower. Computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish by processing data quickly. Computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they @MONTH1 just have. Some people @MONTH1 never have the opportunity to go to places like @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with the computers it's almost like they have been there through virtual tours. Or maybe is in @CAPS1, but @CAPS1 isn't a very popular sport in @LOCATION2. And then they go on there computer and see that there is a ragby @LOCATION1. Then their problem is solved and they can learn about the sport. When you go to a new country, you also get the opportunity to meet new people. But with computers and online sights like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other platforms, you can talk to virtually anyone in the world. I could be sitting in a chair at my home in @LOCATION2, and be having a conversation with someone across the country, or maybe even across the ocean, sharing ideas and cultures! Or possibly you could be talking to some of your really close friends who live just across town, which is very convenient. Either way, the computer is a convinient place to go and talk to someone. I believe that computers are doing us more good than their harm. Our advances in technology have helped us emensly with things like games and robotic surgery, improving both entertainment and healthcare. They also give us the ability to search topics we want to know more about or a faraway place we've never been to, satisfying our curiosity. Finally, we are able to talk online with people that @MONTH1 just be across town or across the ocean, keeping us connected. I hope that my reasoning helps you understand my point of view on this important matter.
1432	1436	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, you sit down at the computer with a glass water and an afterschool snack, possibly an after work snack, ready to relax. You log on to your many accounts, open some chat boxes with your friends & start researching for your project, but distractions are everywhere. As more & more people log on to technology, they seem to come out with new things for computers, yet the downsides are often ignored. Some people are missing out, & dont see the negatives, like social relationships failing, procrastinatting, lack of learning & more, which can have long-term consequences! Beep! one new @CAPS2 message. On the computer you can talk to your friends & family, but sometimes people are on so much that in real life relationships fail because of neglect. You cant type a @ORGANIZATION1 message or hide your feelings behind a screen forever; face-to-face interaction is crucial. Also for kids when they get older, many jobs require customer service, and if you only are good at talking to people on the computer, it cant help you develop necessary interpersonal skills. Whatever you say on the internet can be read & posted anywhere, any site, any time, whereas in real life its really you talking, so you must be cautious. School are learning are very important too, but sometimes I know I have homework but procrastinate and say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 do it later, i need to check this out!"" putting my learning to a stop, which hurts my grades. Some people dont like school, but its very important in a persons life if you like to be successful, you need to balance school, learning, computer time, and dont forget exercise & possibly work for a healthy lifestyle! Computers can be helpful with research & guides, but facebook or twitter is going to slow you down with endless notifications. So buckle down start that research and avoid the distractions! Chatrooms, @ORGANIZATION2, email and other things can be harmful to you if you are not careful. There are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on, posing a serious threat. Its very dangerous, and someone can pretend to be someone there not, leading to deception. Also, computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome, causing physical health issues. There are many bad things that result from computers if they are overused. Many times in your life youll need to find a balance between screen time and other activities. Dont overlook the negative or you could get hurt emotionally or physically. Computers are nice to have, but be careful not to whittle away all of your time on it and miss out on real-life experiences."
1433	1437	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you @DATE1 because of the concern of people that have computers. You are concerned about people whom own computers aren't spending time either excircising, enjoying nature, or not interacting with their family, which is a valid worry. I agree with the fact that @CAPS5 people have computers they become lazy and don't spend time interacting in any activities, preferring screen time instead. I was in @CAPS1 one day and made a survay, for how many people agree that not many people because of computers aren't interacting in any activities, and the results were telling. @PERCENT1 of the people I asked said they agree but of corse the others didn't care much, showing a divide in opinion. Many people @MONTH1 think it's normal to spend hours online but I checked a web site that specializes is weight and how to get to your feet and loose weight eazily, that web site is @CAPS3.com, which provided insight. I read an article on the web page and on paragraph @NUM1 sec. @NUM2 it states that the obesity in the @LOCATION1 is caused by either computer and/or lazyness, linking technology to health issues. Of corse some people might disagree but at the same those people who disagree are big time athleats who do both, managing their time well. I had a chate with @PERSON1, a pro @CAPS4 player he said,""@CAPS5 I was a kid we didn't have those things we were either doing home work or playing outside with our friends, which was healthier."" Even big time athleats agree that physical activity is key. Well in conclusion I agree with the fact that because of the fact that people have computers makes them lazy and do not interact with their family, and this is a trend we should address."
1434	1438	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3't it about time we start thinking more about the digital age and its immense contributions. Computers has contributed so much to society for many years and up to this point I don't believe the world would be able to function without it, as they are integral to modern life. Some people say that computers @CAPS3't good for society but do they really believe that computers gave us the internet, email, most jobs depend on the internet, even games, and many more let me explain the benefits. First of all without computers there would be no internet and without that many jobs would fail because they rely on digital connectivity. Most jobs need the internet to work like architects need the computer to design buildings and houses with precision tools. Almost every office has computers for many different reasons, from data entry to communication. Writers need the computers to wright books, if they were hand writen some people might not be able to read it, so if there was no computers thousands of people would loose their jobs, causing economic issues. My mothers works on a computer she would loose her job, highlighting personal impact. Not only that but we need computers for school to access information and complete assignments. If I had to write a paper on a person it would be almost impossible to do without looking up information about him on the internet, which is a vast resource. Also with writing a paper, some teachers only exept typed papers for clarity. How are we suppost to do that if we didn't have computers that makes home work a lot easier and more efficient. Lastly, computers lets us explore new places from the comfort of home. Goole @LOCATION1 is a map of every place on @LOCATION1 that we can see in detail. If you need to find out where something is you can always count on the internet for accurate directions. If you need direction you can print them out off the internet, making travel simpler. Also if you need to find out what somthing means instead of using an dictionary use the computer for instant definitions. Now can you see how much the computer benefits society in countless ways. Some people say that other people take too long on the computer but you don't have to if you manage your time wisely. I don't know any one that uses the computer for more then work or school, showing that it is primarily a tool for productivity.
1435	1439	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world. I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world because computers help everyone in their education by providing essential resources. For example when i don't understand some words i go to the computer type www.dictionary.com for quick help. Then i words that i don't understand and get immediate clarification. After that the definition comes up and in a faster time because when i look in the dictonary i take about @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to just find a word but on the computer it takes me @NUM3 seconds, saving valuable time. Also computers let us chat and send massages when we can't see or take to a person so we send massages and the receive the message them they send back a message, maintaining connections. Lastly computers help on english class like on spelling, writing, typing, editing & revising, improving our language skills. That's why i think we should keep computers in this world for educational support. I know everyone doesn't know everything, so computers fill knowledge gaps. Computers could help us in math, by using formilas and a calculator on calculator.com for accurate calculations. Also computers help in science, by going to @LOCATION1 and asking questions like, ""what is matter or what are atoms,"" providing detailed answers. Finally i am gonna talk about not understanding some words, a common issue. I always go to dictonary.com so that website could give and help understand the word and get the real definition, enhancing my vocabulary. I always use these @NUM2 websites when i am stuck in math or science or in english, relying on them for assistance. Those websites could help a lot in our education by offering reliable information. That's my way of thinking about the computers helping us in our education and why they are indispensable. My parents are always staked about me talking to my friends and hanging out with them, so computers offer a solution. So, when i can see or talk to my friends i go myspace or facebook or msn to talk and send messages to my friends, staying in touch. We just keep chating and sending can messages because our parents don't let us hang out, making it a safe alternative. Mostly everyone does the same, using technology for social interaction. I do we could also send much other pictures, music and lot more, enriching our communication. That's my opinion of why we should have comuters because we need to chat or send messages to maintain relationships. At the end you know we all need to type our essays, lesson and more, and computers are essential for this. The computers help use make power points they check our spelling, the could also change why we wright like cursive and more, they also help in editing & revising, ensuring quality work. I always keep sending words wrong, so the computer help me on spelling it also makes your project look better and more professional. That's why i think computers are vital tools for learning and communication in today's world."
1436	1440	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. First, computers are a great source to do school work on, allowing for efficient research and composition. Computers let you learn more information quickly and from diverse sources. In addition, computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family through various communication platforms. Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society. My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use to do school work with. An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assignment to do that had to be typed. It is nearly impossible to type a formal essay without a computer. Furthermore, if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and there is no time in your day to go to a library, the computer is a great source for immediate access to digital libraries and academic journals. Now doesn't that make sense? Computers don't just help you with homework, but many people go to college online also. My parents don't have enough money to afford for me to go to a traditional college, ""says @NUM1-year old @PERSON1,"" so I take free courses online and they work great! ""@CAPS1 it obvious that computers have a good effect on people? In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great place to look when you need information. For example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area. The computer is a great place to look at updated pictures, and learn about your new hometown, including local schools and amenities. Sixty-nine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home. People in @MONTH1 also want to learn basic information about bears or bees; it is my belief that the computer is a great source to do learn information. Obviously, computers have a great effect on people and it benefits society. Lastly, computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends. ""I have my whole mom's side of the family living in @LOCATION1. When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them, I feel closer and part of one big happy family,"" says @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2. People who have family living in other states, countries and even other continents, don't get to see each other every day of the year. @CAPS2 is why computers can help the people keep in touch through video calls and instant messages. Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days, weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them often. A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging. Therefore, I strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit society. To sum it all up, computers benefit society and have positive effects on people. Computers are great sources to do school work, they give you information you're looking for, and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends. Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and positive effect on people and benefit society. Thank you!"
1437	1441	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have recently heard about the idea that computers are not very productive. Sure, people get information and talk online, but that can be a bad thing; I agree with computers being overused and used for the wrong reason. To me, the main source of communication is chatting online. Even I talk online all the time. Chatting online is also a terrible thing if you abuse it. Children around the world talk to people they have never seen. People are being deceived abroad because they believe the person they are talking to is the real deal. It is a great way to communicate, just not in the wrong ways. Plagiarism is happening all over the world. People just take whatever they want, when they did not create the original work. We know that if you are caught doing it, you can go to prison. Although there is a way we can help stop the plagiarism, the internet has all the information in the world, and people abuse this access. I have seen papers that have information that they copied and passed off as their own. You can tell because the writing style is different from the rest, and bad things happen. Teachers immediately have you talk to a supervisor about the incident. I know I will try my best to not plagiarize; I can start by getting my own information and properly citing sources. Everyone loves computer and technology, but if everyone can just lay off the computer for a while, things like plagiarism and the abuse of online chatting can be limited and society can foster more genuine interactions.
1438	1442	1	3	I think students should use computers so they can help themselves by using this technology. First, students should use computers because if they wanted to take notes on what they're doing they can just go on the computer and write it down. The computers are faster than just writing by hand. On a computer all you have to do is type, which is often quicker and more legible. You can use a computer to look up whatever you want to look for; for example, the teacher asks to look up a giraffe. The only place you can quickly find information on a giraffe is if you go on the computer and search for it. That's a reason how to look up things; it is easier to look up things online instead of looking it up the old way. Lastly, if you have a project you have to do and it involves pictures and you don't know how to find them, all you just have to do is go on the computer, find what you are searching for, and then you are done after you found everything that you need. It is beneficial to let students use computers inside classrooms and schools so they can get easy help and complete their work more efficiently.
1439	1443	1	3	Computers have been one of technology's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfalls. Originally thought to spread ideas and knowledge of faraway places, computers have been proven to do quite the contrary. Computers are dangerous devices, and are targeting young, wholesome kids. It is the main reason why society is as it is today, predicting that this future generation is wobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation. These devices, the source of this mayhem, must immediately be removed from society because they take away the true benefits of life, have harmful effects on our health, and support some of the country's deadliest predators. Firstly, computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood. Since @DATE1, the amount of adolescent users has shot up by @PERCENT1. Amazingly enough, @PERCENT2 of parents polled admitted that their children spend at least @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. This takes away the pleasures of reading, exercising, spending time outside and hanging with friends and family. These negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society, especially teenagers, the most frequent users. As a result, diet and exercise are curtailed, raising the obesity number by @PERCENT3, and lack of outdoor or family activities have promoted anti-social behavior. At this alarming rate, our future generation may indeed be balancing on a cracked foundation. In addition to limiting diet and exercise, computers are also the source of yet another health risk. As long as the computers are plugged in, they emit invisible waves of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are linked to diseases and cancers. Use of computers has been thought to cause brain tumors and leukemia, as well as other brain disorders and cancers. Leukemia, when caused at a young age, is difficult to cure and stunts the child's development. Children exposed to at least @NUM2 hours a day to a computer screen, compared to the few who spend their time outdoors, are @NUM3 times as likely to develop such possibilities. The ultimate prevention to such risks is to reduce exposure to such causes, limiting computer use completely. Lastly, computers are harmful because they are also a deadly weapon. As an adolescent unthinkingly surfs the web and chatrooms, they are at risk of attack by thousands of child predators prowling the web. Computers contain extremely valuable and secret information, such as names, birthdates, genders and even social security numbers. With one click, accepting a stranger's invite, the online predators hack into the child's computer and obtain such valuable information. Or the predators may be less passive and attack directly—asking personal questions to the child themselves. In fact, a familiar story tells the unfortunate fate of one local teenage girl, who unknowingly chatted with an online stranger. This online predator smoothly invited her to the mall, where they met. A couple of devastating weeks later, the girl's remains were found, burned, as the last deadly act the predator performed on the teen. Therefore, computers are simply too dangerous, a predator's handbook as they search for their next victim. By removing the computer, you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well. It is amazing to learn that technology's greatest advancement, the computer, can unleash such harmful effects. Lack of engaging activities such as exercising and reading are stunted by the ever distracting computer; its electromagnetic radiation attacks our health; and lastly, it supports the acts of the thousands of cruel, sneaky online predators awaiting your child on the web. By removing the source of all these troubles, those acts can be prevented and society may begin the path to reform and recovery.
1440	1444	1	3	"A large amount of people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees this technology benefits society. I think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways. This very useful technology has a positive effect on people because it allows people to send, receive, and research a vast variety of information easily and from the comfort of their homes. @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to get information and get it more quickly than reading a book about that specific topic. They say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker for accessing data. My cousin and I were both given the same research paper to do. He used several books to get information on the topic and I used the computer. The project took me only @NUM1 days to do, while it took him a whole week to complete. @PERSON1, a computer programming expert, said, ""Computers have made receiving information so much faster. I vehemently believe that everyone should own this device for educational purposes."" Moreover, computers help with global communication. There are many ways to keep in touch with people over the world, like email, chat rooms, and websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These websites are a great tool to keep in touch with family and friends or even fans and professional contacts. @PERSON2, lead singer of the band @CAPS3 from @ORGANIZATION1, said ""@CAPS1 is a way to talk to the fans directly and post updates about upcoming tours and albums. Not only is it great for bands but it is great for college students."" My older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away. The computer can also help with business communications and operations. Meetings can be done through @ORGANIZATION2 or a different webchat service, saving time and travel costs. Emails are a great way to send information quickly and reliably. @NUM2 of business meetings are held over the internet, which has benefited work ethics and productivity. Please heed my advice and use the internet and computer responsibly. It will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information, ultimately enhancing your daily life and work."
1441	1445	1	3	Every single computer in the world should have internet access. Internet helps people in many ways. Anybody can do their homework on a computer. You can even talk to your friends on a computer, send emails to anybody around the world, or just play computer games. Teachers use computers because it is the easiest way to find information that they might need for a lesson. Students can use a computer to do a research paper for, let's say, history class. You can find anything about anybody or anything on a computer that has internet on it. There is also a cool tool found on some computers called Microsoft Word. It lets you write anything you want and if you mess up a word you can fix it easily. Some schools actually supply their students with their own personal computer. They can do their homework whenever they want and just send an email to their teacher with the homework attached. Computers can store more information than any book in the world because they have way more storage capacity for data. Also, a cool thing about a computer is that there are websites that let you talk to your friends that live near you without actually having to go to their houses; you can put pictures of yourself on Facebook or Myspace or any other site. You also can play games on Facebook, Myspace, or anything else. Schools should use computers because it is the best way to get the information that you need to do something, like science, math, or history homework, or even just for fun to learn something new that you never knew before. You should agree with me because everything I wrote down was true and is almost the best way to get pictures or any information that you need to do something, or even just to talk to a friend that you haven't seen in a while.
1442	1446	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Some people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wrapped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in our town. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or physical activity and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes do not do anything about it because they have the same problem themselves. This just shows that computers and other technology are affecting families around the country by making them overweight and unhealthy. Many children do not know the first thing about nature and the environment. People say that computers educate people about things, but nature is a big part of our lives. The best way to learn about it and help is to experience it directly. Computers take away the time they could be outside, and the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can help protect it. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending quality time with your family in the park or at the pool. My dad always spent his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearranged his schedule so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life, and less time on the computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the environment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my family's lifestyle then it will do the same for others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely take a positive effect on our community.
1443	1447	1	3	Dear Editor of the Daily City News, computers are a wonderful tool and they bear many positive impacts on society. First, computers have created numerous new forms of communication. Also, they have enabled us to create a new age in research. In addition, computers have given us amazing modern ways to entertain ourselves. Computers have an incredibly positive effect on people. One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans is that we have developed many new ways to communicate with people all over the world. First, one fantastic program such as instant messaging has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people anywhere in the world, and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey, a large percentage of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication besides face-to-face talking. Second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had a friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we do not live in the same town, and I am sure a similar experience has occurred to you or someone you know. Finally, the popular program of Facebook has changed communication forever. People can now see things going on in your life wherever they want. Although some may criticize it, it has been a wonderful tool. Computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively impact people is that they have created a new era for research. One example would be our phenomenal search engine, Google. Google can find almost everything, helping people in finding information. Schools now use computer resources such as online libraries which allow for deeper research due to the fact that there is so much information available on the internet. In addition, computers have created many opportunities for people to learn more because of the billions of web pages in existence. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of people have found a website containing information relevant to their research that was more current than a book. Computers are the reason that research has continued to thrive and new discoveries continue to be made. Finally, computers have established amazing new entertainment for people of all ages. First, video websites such as YouTube have created a place for people to watch music videos and creative films just to enjoy themselves. If you cannot get tickets to a concert you want, going online to watch music videos by that person is a much cheaper alternative. Second, gaming websites are a less expensive option; if you go online you can play similar games at no charge. Finally, websites with appropriate funny stories posted on them are a fantastic way to get the laughter of a comic without leaving your couch. Wouldn't you prefer to stay home, rather than going out when it is not necessary? Computers are an incredible way to achieve quick, inexpensive entertainment in today's economy. In conclusion, computers impact people in many positive ways. They have established new forms of communication, research, and entertainment that will forever change society. Therefore, I invite you to join me to demonstrate the incredible strength of computers.
1444	1448	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Have you ever stopped to think what modern day technology has brought us? A great example is computers. Many people use this device to book vacations, talk and build relationships with people, and to discover new ideas the world has to offer. I disagree strongly with the critics. The hot sun glaring down at you is just killing you, so why not book a vacation to a tropical island! Many people go on vacation and what brought them there was when they sat at their computer looking at hotels and booking flights. This modern day technology has brought many humans to places they wanted to go. Over half of American households have a chat account to talk with family and friends. The distance from the country of Europe to the United States is over thousands of miles and every time you make a phone call it can lead to a big bill. Modern technology has surpassed the phones and is now using the computer to talk to far away friends and family. In the process, the computer has connected over millions of single people and helped in expressing relationships. Many arguments have been led because of this disagreement. Many critics are saying not many people interact with family and friends in person anymore. On the other hand, the computer has ensured that many people are connecting and communicating regularly; they can set a plan to meet up. Many critics have argued that people spend too much time on the computer. Although this is true, there should be decisions that will improve the health of the human by limiting usage of them. Setting standards on computers can improve these problems and help encourage exercising. In this case, I strongly disagree with the critics and stand by my side of good uses. If they took computers away, not only would people's files be lost but everyone would be disorganized in the long run. Lastly, discovering new places and websites teaches even the smartest guy or girl something new. After reading this, I have proven that my viewpoint should be admired by many people.
1445	1449	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefit society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and they teach people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of teenagers that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than those who do not. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. They give us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the nation has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school. I know from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school; whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study for a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. The computer has proven that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do, it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes focused on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That is because with all the games and websites it will teach us hand-eye coordination while I am just having fun. Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy using it. That is ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that does not benefit society, then nothing does. As I have shown, computers definitely do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because they give people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand-eye coordination. In conclusion, computers have a strong and beneficial effect on people today.
1446	1450	1	3	Click click, another information page opens up on your handy desktop computer. These trusty, smart, and easy to use devices are always a wonderful object to have. Although, people are now starting to claim that these handy desktops are bad for your well-being, opposing that people strongly think that we don't get enough exercise or outdoor activities in. Well computers are such a great entertainment system, also, they have a vast information supply, and even allow socialization with friends and family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and DVD players are no match for the internet and it's great wide spread entertainment system. The computer has all of the family fun movies, iTunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the internet and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse is incredibly simple. The internet is the obvious best reason for a family movie night. One of the greatest pros about the internet is the vivid source of information. Google, Wikipedia, or even Dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the modern era. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun I would rather learn about a sunny beach of Hawaii or the great landscape of the Swiss Alps. If you're looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the computer is a sure easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in Australia or Germany? The answer is simple, Skype, Facebook, Myspace and more are all available on your handy computer. Many sites have a no fee policy so they can't charge you money for social living with friends. As a personal experience I could now talk to my cousins who live in London and the Swiss Alps due to the great interaction site of Facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that they're even there? Obviously internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends, I'm sure people will open their eyes and see the great uses of the computer.
1447	1451	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps them learn about foreign places, it allows them to connect with family and friends that live far away, and it helps them with their jobs. Computers help people learn about foreign places. Before my uncle went to Japan, he wanted to learn about their culture. He went on the computer and researched Japanese culture, so that he can be prepared. How would you feel if you went to another country and knew nothing about it? What if you were to go to that country and do something that was disrespectful to their culture, but you didn't know because you didn't do research on it? I know I would feel bad. Now some people might say that you can read a book on that country, but not everyone has time to sit and read a book. Computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other quickly and efficiently. I think that's pretty positive. Don't you? People connect with each other through the computer. More than eighty percent of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers. Nowadays there are social networking sites, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away. When I moved to California from Texas, I thought that I was never going to see my best friend again. But then, I got a Facebook account and found her on there. I was very estatic. We swapped numbers and addresses. Now everyday I talk to her on the computer. Also, the only way I talk to my aunty, who lives in Florida, is by the computer. I can't talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up. Another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their biological parents or siblings. It brings them together and helps them reconnect with each other. Computers help people with their job. Anybody who is a manager of a company has a laptop. It helps them store data, files, and important information securely. Computers are essential to these people. Also, it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation. How would you feel if you owned a company and went on a vacation, but you couldn't keep track of it because you didn't have a computer? It provides essential peace of mind. Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps learn about places, talk to their family, and keep track of their job, making daily life much more manageable.
1448	1452	1	3	"Dear Editor, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in pilot training. In fact, a flight school, in Florida, USA, just began using these games as part of their training this past year. Instructors report that piloting skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named John Doe, thirty-five years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did it, he said he had been playing computer games since he was ten years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The National Institute of Health's recent study reports that brains were twenty percent more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. It is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to Canada. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and Skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. Jane Smith, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like it really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by a local university in 2022, one hundred people were put in separate rooms with personal computers for one hour. Afterwards, seventy-five percent said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. In fact, at VirtualTours.org, you can take virtual tours of over fifty different countries, including France, Japan, Italy, and Brazil. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinaire Martha Stewart not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them online! In a recent interview by Food magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous triple chocolate cake, Martha Stewart admits she found most of them online, saying, ""It's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al Gore currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" It is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other places. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. It is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community."
1449	1453	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I have recently saw that you think that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of exercising or hanging with their friends and family. Well I think the opposite of that opinion. People interact with people online if they want to. People can also learn new things. Plus computers help people make money. So read on to hear more. Most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow. Ninety percent of all people have either a Facebook, a Myspace, a Skype, or all three. On any of those sites you interact with people. We can meet new people on the internet. Like people on the other side of the state or country. Also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town. Like for instance if there was a missing child we know the description, so we could help find him or her. Not only do people interact but people can research useful information. For an example, one day I was told to do a project on teen mothers. I went straight to the library I took some books out and whatever I couldn't find in the books, I went to the computer for. Also we can learn about faraway places like Paris or Tokyo. My mom always says, ""Clean your room or I'm going to give your stuff to people in need."" The first time she said that to me I went to the computer to see how other people were having to live. Some were in good, nice, big houses but then others lived in boxes and trash cans. That changed me big time, I felt really bad for those people. Lastly computers help people make money and support their family. Seventy percent of all people found out about their job on a computer. They can go to websites to find good safe jobs that makes good money. Plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home. Some people don't have the money for babysitters so they have to watch their kids all day and therefore have to work from home to make money. Finally people can apply for jobs or even community service online. My sister, Sarah, got her first job by going on the City Museum's website and applying right there on the computer. Therefore computers are good. I say this because people can interact with other people online, people can research useful information, and finally computers help people find jobs and make money. Do you use computers for any of these reasons?"
1450	1454	1	3	Dear Newspaper, It's a small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelmingly positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination. For another, they are a great means of communication. Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some critics say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more connected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In a recent study by Dr. Evans, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged three to five when they used educational computer programs such as a popular learning game for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as much as possible. I know that this skill greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the most basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and wherever - they check their inbox. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like Zoom can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use my computer to keep in touch with family on the East Coast. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find it closed) to the average life span of the African elephant (seventy years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from Google to Bing, and find answers instantly. Find about the Great Pyramids without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of the Northern Lights - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are often shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat it like one.
1451	1455	1	3	"To whom this @MONTH1 concern: I heard that people are having a debate to tell whether computers benefit us or are bad for us. I think that computers are great. They allow us to talk with people all over the world. They give us the ability to learn about things. Lastly, they save us money. Aren't these all things benefit us? I think so. Please keep reading to hear more about why computers are good. First off, computers give us the ability to talk with people all over the world. A lot of my family lives in different @CAPS1, and thats how I talk to them is through the computer. We can have video calls and see each other's faces, which makes the distance feel smaller. If you move away from all your friends and family, wouldn't you want to still keep intouch with them? Well you could by chatting with them on the computer. To keep the ball rolling, computers give us the oppirtunity to learn about different things. If I go on ""@CAPS2.com"", I could type in anything I want, and get information about it. Or I get an answer to a question. Are you a parent that wants to know how their child is doing in school? You could go to their school website and check their grades in each class they have. This immediate access to information helps with school projects and homework. To wrap it all up, computers save us money everyday. If you needed to look up information for a project without a computer, you would have to drive all the way to the library and buy a book. But with a computer, you could get information easy in the convienience of your own home, saving you both time and the cost of transportation. In conclusion, you could see that computers benefit us in many ways. Thay give us the ability to talk to friends and family all around the world. They give us the oppirtunity to look up information quick and easy. Lastly, they save us money everyday. Thank you for reading my letter, which I'm sure has persuaded you to think that computers are a good thing."
1452	1456	1	3	"How would you like to got a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after-school? What if you were bored to death, and you couldn't watch t.v. or play games? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer: you can watch videos and play games, you can chat and talk to people, and you can even boost up your grade. I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @CAPS2, let's look at how a computer can change your life. Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. You are going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser. I remember @TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1 and @DATE1 I found out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we talked about how that @CAPS7 posibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school. For example, how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can do. If you got bad grades (without computer), you will go to a bad college and have a bad job, however, if you got good grades(with computer), you will go to a good college and get a good job. Next, let's look at how you can chat or talk to people. You can have a mesaging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers. You can also communicate with people who has an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them. So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public. Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together. A computer can really the of your life. Lastly, let's look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored. Why you go youtube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting? ""@CAPS10, I was done with homework and I didnt know what to do, so i online and spend only watching youtube videos, sometimes people like playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing tetris, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight's before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, can entertain you as well. As you can see, saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely non-sense. Computers can and make you. I honestly never seen someone on the computer for a bad reason, as they are tools for improvement and connection in our daily lives."
1453	1457	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers do not effect people bacause I believe that they actually benefit people and the way people live computers do more than have games, In some cases help you gain knowledge computers can be used for entertainment, jobs, research, projects and more. Not just for games. Computers help peopel do their job. For example, if you work as a lawyer, you @MONTH1 need a computer to type your documents up. If you have bad pemanship and have a joblike a lawyer. You @MONTH1 need to refer to something in your document and can't read it, that's a problem. So in that case, that;s where the role of the comuter steps in, providing clear and legible documents. I also think that computers do not have effect on people because through garde schoo, sometimes kids need the internet. Some people don't have the option of a library of ther isn't one near them. By using the computer for inofrmation on a project or homework, I think it benefits, not effects. The computer provides a vast resource for learning that is accessible from home. I have one more reason why I think computers benefit, not effect. I believe that if you have a @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, you have a chance to meet people from all over the world. Just by that, you could learn something you could learn their lifestyle and things about thier culture, which broadens your understanding of the world.Thank you for reading my letter, hopefully you will rethink your decision and see the many positive ways computers help us in our daily lives.
1454	1458	1	3	"Due to an on going debattle about weither or not computers benefit society I am writing to you to inform you of my opinion on this mater. I believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back. I believe this because. First of all, computer bring about online communication. Also computers advance and enhance learning, had to mention that computers advance emloyment. As I mentioned, computers bring about online communications. Now after reading this there must be one side running thru your head define this well online communication, include social networkinjg sites litre facebook and twitter and not to forget my space. This also includes email and blogs and some chat sites. Okay enough of that But how do these things inventions iprove our lives. These inventions allow long distance communication bringing people ""closer together."" @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And thru facebook, my mother can speak with him any time she wishes and over from their relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 be very nessary @CAPS1 same. Also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication. Besides, I mentioned learinig. Computers can improve learning in a variety of ways. Computers improve learning because they speed the flow of information to the students can go to such places and a school websites to findout more on a particular occuring at the school. @CAPS1 example, I go on my school's website to retreve nightly homewrok assignments and read the next day's daily annocments. Teachers might post helpfel hints on homework and @MONTH1 a detailed explanation of the assignment, which helps students understand the material better. Also computers can improve learning by assiting with research projects @CAPS1 example a couple of weeks ago my health class was information car our illegal drug project. So with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it, showing how computers are essential tools for modern education and work."
1455	1459	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 thingk that computers are helping our society, but I disagree. People who are sitting on the computer are not getting exercise or seeing beautiful nature. Do you want to get fat sitting next to a metal box? People are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important. People in your life. Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer. All of the cool, fit people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of the cool people and go outside and have yourself a ban looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals. You can do both of those with your friends and family while sitting on your computer you don't see them as much @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends and I bet you are one of them. Friends and family can also help you get through hard times without them whi knows wgere you would be in life. So do yourself a favor get off the computer, and go visit some really great people. Its now or neve to get off that computer or your family and friends are going to leave you and you are going to get fat on top of that. Do you want to be that person? You are also going to miss out on the beauty of nature. So go, go, go, have yourself some fun outside in the fresh air and sunshine where real life happens.
1456	1460	1	3	I have realized that there has been a disagreement about computers and their positive and negative effects on people. It seems to me, in my opinion, that computers have more of a negative effect on people than positive. I believe that people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising; they don't spend quality time with family and friends and need to get fresh air and enjoy nature. Although computers are a great piece of technology, many don't get outside to enjoy the nature and fresh air because their computers are inside their homes. This is not good because when you go outside, it helps skin health from the sunlight and lets in fresh air for your lungs. In addition, a walk outside to enjoy nature wouldn't hurt either. It can relieve stress and can be relaxing. Furthermore, it is obvious when people are on the computer, they usually block out what their friends and family are saying to them. People can lose track of time and be on the computer for hours. Instead you should use this time to be with your friends and family. Being with your family can make your bond between each other stronger and you can get along with each other better. Also, having a nice family time is a good way to help be with your family. Many experts say that eating a family dinner can help a child's grades and prevent them from using drugs or dropping out of high school or college. Finally, kids are more obese than before because they don't get enough exercise. A significant percentage or more kids are obese from recent studies. Due to this, this can lead to bone and joint issues, heart disease, lung problems, diabetes and asthma. These issues above are serious health problems if not treated. If kids exercise instead of being on a computer all day, the number of obese kids will drop drastically. Exercise can help kids' self esteem, and get them back in shape. They can either play sports or even take a walk or run. There are many different things you can do to exercise and it is fun for kids. Unquestionably, there is definitely more reasons why there is a negative effect on kids and adults due to computers for the reasons above and more. Computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air. Likewise, they also prevent families and friends from spending time with each other and lastly, it isn't allowing kids to exercise which can lead to obesity, which is a serious concern for our society's future.
1457	1461	1	3	I would agree because computers do help people with other things like vacation sights, jobs, presents and shopping. So many uses for the computer. But creators of the computer are worried that people are spending too much time on the computer. Mainly it is about concerned users; most of those people complain that they are having no time with their family and friends. You never know if the users are looking up vacation trips for both friends and families. The thing that concerned people do not get is that the computer can teach you a lot of things, like history, mathematics, science experiments and many more. Computers are also used in schools to help students with their work; even teachers use the computer for grades. It is true about people not going outside getting some fresh air or even taking a walk in the park. They cannot keep themselves on the computer for many hours; it is just crazy. So I would go with both sides. It is just better to enjoy life than just look up things that you do not really need to. You should only need to go on for essential tasks like paying bills and looking for furniture for your house. That is why the computer was invented, to assist with our lives, not to consume them entirely.
1458	1462	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, imagine a world where the unemployment rate rises significantly, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just disappeared. I think computers are more beneficial to society than some people realize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an accountant. Computer games and other applications help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teens how to become successful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now access grades in a heartbeat and provide students with immediate feedback. My computer helps me with homework and learning new skills every day, proving its immense value in our modern world.
1459	1463	1	3	Dear Newspaper: I have just read your recent article on whether computers are helping, or wrecking society. I think it is helping because without the internet I can't learn how to do things such as clear a drain the proper way. This takes time to learn but out over internet I learned it quickly. If you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the pipe and potentially harm you. There are many other uses if you just can't find an answer; your family is counting on you. You can do two things, you can panic and let everyone down, or you can go on the internet and save the day. But all I have said leads to the real issue. The computer does affect how people exercise; I know what you are thinking, but you have to be clear enough. The internet does affect how you exercise. Its pros include showing better and more effective ways to be healthy. There is also cons; some of the cons include finding unhealthy shortcuts. All of these can lead to different outcomes, but it isn't inherently bad; its only a bad thing when you misuse it. In conclusion, just do the right things with the technology available and you will be healthier than ever before.
1460	1464	1	3	Dear Readers of the local community, in this time almost everything in our modern world revolves around technology, from communication to entertainment, with the internet changing our lives so quickly. Do we still have time to stop and smell the roses? People are no longer outdoors looking at the distinguished leaves in the fall or at the park or playing sports or baseball, but instead sitting on a chair watching a video online or playing games for hours. In our community, health problems have become an epidemic! Why? Because rather than enjoying the fresh air and open fields our town has to offer, people are enjoying their screens and devices! As a resident, I have seen the obesity rate climb significantly over the years. That is more of our community affected! What other rate is going up so increasingly? The number of homes that own computers and the amount of time each home uses them! A local doctor found that in the last several years the number of type two diabetics has almost doubled! A researcher at a university wrote an article. In his article he exclaimed that a large percentage of households own more than one computer per household! Technology companies are all doing very well in this economic slump, while sporting goods, books and exercise equipment are not. Experts see this as a main cause for the growing lack of exercise and increase in time on home computers. Also just as important is how all this time spent on computers is effecting children, with many kids spending a significant portion of their day on a computer. It has become apparent that children are spending less time playing sports and more time on their amazing laptops playing video games! I am a young person, and I have been playing sports in my town for many years. When I was younger, the travel team used to have so many people try out it was difficult to get on, but now so few people play that we barely need to try out! When I grow up I am most likely going to end up in a job somewhere working for some big business where I will probably be working on a computer, so for now I want to enjoy being a kid! We should not let kids waste these years on video games; they will waste enough of their lives behind a computer later in life. We are talking about the health of our future! Our future, the children of tomorrow, do we want a world where everyone has diabetes and lives on their computers? Through the rapid changes in technology, we need to keep one thing the same no matter how difficult it is. That is we need to go outside and help keep our community in good shape, and we cannot do that from behind a computer screen. Thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter.
1461	1465	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I am on the side of computers. You @MONTH1 think I'm only saying that because I'm @NUM1 years old and it is basically what I do for fun. Computers do benefit society because they are fun, a source of communication, good for schooling and education, and for work. Computers are not just the @CAPS1 but also @CAPS6 procesor and @ORGANIZATION1 and everything like that. Computers provide games for everyone from ages @NUM2 to @NUM3. When it is raining outside your parents are at work and you are by yourself and have nothing to do, turn on the computer. Play a game. There are many fun websites made for everyone, offering a wide variety of entertainment. Computers also provide an exellent source of communication. There are all different kinds of @CAPS2-mail. @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and many other sites are exellent for talking to friends. Not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via @CAPS5 or any of the others it is nice to chat, allowing you to stay connected easily. Computers provide an exellent source of education. If you are doing a history project and you need more information and pictures, log onto a computer and @ORGANIZATION3 it. At our school we have edline which tells us all of our homework assignments. It is extremly handy. Now they also have schooling tutors online. It is great for getting extra help. Computers are great for work. @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION5, and other @ORGANIZATION2 wear or other compnies. You can find your information and make something out of it. It is very, very useful for buisness workers to organize and complete their tasks. As you can see, computers have a lot of great uses. I think computers effect people in a positive way by helping them in positive ways. Computers allow fun, communication, educational purposes, and work uses. Computers are a good thing to have around, @CAPS7't you think?
1462	1466	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, minute man, people are complaining. They are complaining about how computers interfer with their family and life. But it teaches adults and kids new things. Being on the computer is an exeperince. You can almost search anything on the computer. You can learn history or about the present time. Like one time I was searching (@CAPS1.com) on how to fix a playstation @NUM1 controller. I found out how to do it and it worked, which was very satisfying. While you are on the computer you can interact with friends, find out about the weather, and find out if you have any homework. The computer also teaches you how to do different stuff. Like this one time I learned to do a hardflip from a video tutorial. Also computer's can help you with your homework. Like if you have science homework and you're trying to figure a word out you can search it. Or if you're looking for a book for @LOCATION2 you can search websites for good books or ask a friend online. The computer helps many different people in many different ways. And you know how people say computers are bad. If you have a t.v. for game system its like having a computer, right? But don't go kill your self looking for a cheap one. But I do suggest that everyone should have a computer, they are helpful and fun for learning and connecting.
1463	1467	1	3	"Almost everyone in the @LOCATION1 uses a computers at one point in their life. Computers are a way to teach hand eye coordination through programs, games and typing. The internet can be used for researching different far away cultures, as well as someone's own lifestyle. This compact well made piece of technology has been belaming more and more intricate. Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will be the down fall or support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand-eye coordination. Since the time children are in grade school, they learn typing on a keyboard. Special programs help kids learn the necesary skill while enjoying the practice. When I was small, a mere fight years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to barnes and noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed ""type to learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons as well as teaching children to type is general, teaches hand-eye coordination in high school, college, and the job world. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resemes, and applications. In this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand-eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, bejewled or car racing teach the skill and much more advanced games for example, world of war craft need perfect coordination can be through typing and games, both on the computer. Though some experts are conserned ""people are spending too much time on the computer and less time..enjoying nature,"" you are able to learn about geography, travel, and nature. One amazing on a computer is the world wide web. This consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and information arte you in an upcoming geography uses? Are you planning a trip the for you do you need to find a definition for the word ""cognitive""? of @CAPS1 pertain to you, a legitamite website house your and all you need to do is search. Instead of having to travel to learn about special wonders, for travel prices are expensive and you can simply, click and type to and amazing at your searching on a computer, you can learn about long ago cultures and rituals. Information you would find at museum @NUM1 years ago. @CAPS1 complex simple to use technological a world of pictures simple, art and history right at your fingertips, making learning accessible to everyone."
1464	1468	1	3	Did you know that four out of five households have a computer? But why so many? It's because computers have a positive effect on people, Have you ever thought why? With computers you can contact people in different parts of the @CAPS1. You can search up different information over the internet. Computers also benifit other electronic inventions. What do @LOCATION5, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION6 and @LOCATION7 all have in common? you can contact the people there with computers! while talking to people around the @CAPS1, you can learn something about a culture or lifestyle that you didn't know before. You just might make a new friend along the way. Picture if you will, a hard working business man who lives in the @LOCATION1. He works for a @CAPS1 - famous company and has to go to a meeting with the big boss is @LOCATION4. Wouldn't it just be easier to set up a video chat? That way, there's no hassle with a plane voyage and it's much easier and saves time. Why do you think it's called the @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3? Over the internet, you can search up unlimited amounts of information. Animals, sports, a report to do on @LOCATION3, where do you go to find easy-to-read information instantly? Search him up on @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You never what might find out. There are new additions daily. With no computers, how would you download music to an @NUM1? You can't, you have to use a computer. Computers benifit a lot of other electronic equipment. You can download videos, print out photographs and charge @CAPS4 and other electronics. Technology these days is empressive. It gave birth to the much-used computer. Computers have a large positive effect on our lifestyle. Contact with otehrs around the @CAPS1 is now easier than ever. Information can be found instantly. And with computers, other electronics can work as well, creating a connected and efficient world.
1465	1469	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you believe people spend way to much that on computers? In a survey @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 of people rather go on the computer then take a walk in as parts. People who spend a lot of time on computers are lacking important things. For istance, they spend so much time on computer they have lose time to exerise, enjoy natue, and interact with friends and family. Computers have a negative effect on people. Many people don't excerise for only @NUM2 min. But when you are distracted on your computer aming or facebooking you forget to excrise or just go it for @NUM3 min. Because you want to get back to the computer. Computers on your desk starring at you and you sampled to go on. While, the yoga mat or weights sit on ground sterring at you too. However, the computers is mak fun and less woris. Therefore, your more willing to go on computer then excrise. Computers make it hand to excrise because your less into thinking how to this right and take you the because your thinking about a computer game, you played facebook, email and bunch more things on computer. So computers are unhealthy for people to have. Nature is beatiful, how the trees sway in the and butterflies fly in the air then there are all type of seasons with beatiful senery and. However there re stuffy room with sholves a desk and some picture that's the serey the people got when @MONTH1 are on the computer all the time. People are missing out on enjoying nature little and big beatities. People comuter aren't walking on beach on taking a nice long hike in woods dad not taking a stroll in a ark these are missing out on getting some fresh air and seeing the senery nature has to offer us. Instead they are sitting chair starring at a computer screen. However, pretty could that be compared to enjoying nature beatity? Computers are testing away people enjoying nature. Hanging-out with friends are family is a fun thing to @CAPS1 but how are you suppose to long out with them if your to the computer? They aren't going to internet with their friends or family. This could affect their future they could grow up sad and lonely aren't know how to act around people they get job their works around people. The people who are addicted to computer are missing out an doing something fun with some they lose or enjoy to be around. Computers could be people far away friends but how about instead call that friend on. They probably rather hear wire then. See a message so computers interesting with friends and family. Now, that you know how had the computers affect people you can understand why I'm computers. They cut in the peoples the excrise, and have people not enjoying nature. people want hang out with friends and famlies. So hopefully you can see what a bad affect computers have on our health and social lives.
1466	1470	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Do you like a place where you can control what you see and where you go? I know I do. Well, if you agree with me then the computer is your cup of tea. I think that computers have a positive effect on society. I think this for three main reasons: connecting with others, getting constant updates on whats going on, and a learning tool make up only some of the fascinating aspects the computer has. So read on, I know you will think the same way as me about computers given my knowledge below. The computer captures over a million humans attention with online social networks; Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter are the main attractions. In all of these websites you can keep up with whats going on with your friends and whats new around the world. These online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure. All these websites provide the information that people want and keep them logging back on everyday. I think these websites are great and can only improve society. This is my first benefit of a computer. Another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society. Many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show. They provide pictures, stories, and actual videos of whats happening right now. The computer helps us americans know what is happening in America and lets America know whats happening in the world and the universe. The Americans aren't the only ones though; the computer provides international news and gossip for everyone. Here is another reason why the computer is great for society. There are many things that us kids don't know and if we need some deep information we search it on the computer. The computer provides websites giving information on every topic you could think of. For example, if I were to be stuck on some science homework I could probably type in my question on ask.com and get a great answer. Parents and teachers want their kids to succeed and the computer definitely helps. In conclusion, I have given you three great, well thought out reasons why the computer benefits society. Connecting with others, updates worldwide and information on school all are in a great piece of technology called the computer. I hope you will trust me that the computer has a positive effect on society.
1467	1471	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers definitely help our society for many reasons. For example we can talk to friends on line. Not only that but then you can learn a lot more about the places you want to visit. It's also true that you can gain more hand eye coordination with those nifty devices. Read on to find out how you can talk to friends on the computer. You can talk to friends on the computer by one of the most common websites, Facebook. Many people use Facebook, that's a huge percentage! Not only that but you can also meet new friends on the computer by talking about games or popular T.V. shows. Wouldn't it be nice to meet up with all of your old friends from school that you don't ever see. My mom always says that that is how she stays close to her friends and that is the same with me. Do you want to learn about the far away places without breaking the bank? If you do then you should definitely search for some nice websites that explain culture and other details about other parts of the world. It's also true that you can learn a quick history lesson on some webpages. What if you are going on a trip but you don't know where to go, then you could use the beloved internet. Read on to find out how the internet helps gain hand eye coordination. You can gain hand eye coordination by using the computer in so many ways. For example you can practice typing up essays and other work projects. A large percentage of people that have computers type faster than they write. That's almost everyone. Not only that but don't you think typing is faster than writing? Also you see the words that you are typing and you press with your hands. Thank you for reading my essay on why computers are benefiting our society. Just remember we learn more every day from the computers. Also you can talk to friends. Lastly you can plan your trip.
1468	1472	1	3	Dear Editor, The computers that are being used, do have a positive effect on people. For example, there's better communication with friends and family, you get instant news on any topic, and you get advanced education. Imagine if no important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries the person can contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a Facebook, or other interacting websites, you know what's going on in your friends life all the time without having to be reaching them all the time to see how they are doing. Every adult watches the news at night before they go to bed to see what has happened, what if you went to bed early. How would you know what happened? That's when you would go online and check what you missed, you could've missed out on what happened in Europe and Asia, or missed out on the wars in the Middle East, or even tragedies that happened right near you. Not only will you have better communication and the news at the top of your fingers, but you will also have advanced education. If a student is doing a science project, but the work doesn't contain all the information they need, the internet is a way to expand their education. Also, there are various other educational resources available online. Therefore, computers do have a positive effect on people; you can stay communicated, updated with the latest news and have an advance education.
1469	1473	1	3	Dear local newspaper, This paper is going to be about the reason computers are bad. First, computers are bad cause people wouldn't have time to enjoy the nature when its nice and warm out. They would rather stay inside on a beautiful day. Second reason is cause they won't spend time with their families at all or their friends and the only time they would get off the computer is to pay the bill and buy a game for the computer. This can hurt family relationships. The third reason is that how are they going to get a job cause they wouldn't want to get up to look for a job cause they're having too much fun until they cut off the light then he would do dumb things to pay his bill so he can start to play again and that's going to make him do it over and over again. That's why it's bad to have a computer. But now where is people going to go in life cause some people love to play games on the computer and some don't that's why some computers are bad for some people. And this is just my opinion there's a lot more people might think so to. And thank you for having time to read this.
1470	1474	1	3	The reason why I think computers are good is because people like to do their work, or children like the games on the computers. They provide entertainment and useful functions for different age groups. The second reason is that adults like to do their jobs online, which can be more efficient and convenient. They can communicate with colleagues and manage tasks from home. Finally, people who have computers are probably happy because computers are a good thing to have because you can do everything on it. My opinion is that computers are good for people because you can do everything like play games, go on Myspace, Facebook, Twitter and a lot of other websites for fun and connection.
1471	1475	1	3	It is my opinion that computers are not completely bad for people; computers can also be good for people. For example, computers allow people to communicate in seconds from around the world, and computers open up new information to anyone. But a major concern is that people spend so much time on the computer that they don't get any exercise. Firstly, computers are a good thing because they allow news and information to get to the whole world in seconds. Very recently during the war in the @LOCATION1, news reporters were not allowed into towns and cities where a user uses being fought. Every day social messaging sites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 brought news to the world through cell phone videos and pictures that wouldn't have been seen by the world had it not been for computers and the internet. Secondly, computers allow people to gain knowledge in a matter of minutes on topic the sun. For example, if you need information on the country in the you can find it with a computer. If you need a recipe for an @CAPS3 desert look it up with a computer. If you would like to know what the weather will be like, you can look it up with a computer. With a computer the knowledge of the world can be found by anyone. Lastly, the leading argument against is the people don't get enough exercise because they are always on the computer. The people computers say that people will because a their computer that will the lives these arguments can be the overwhelming of heavy computer users do get enough exercise A recent status that among the internet average grade of A or better, who also do at least With this information the argument is less convincing. In conclusion, computers are not completely good or completely bad for society. Their strong points are communication and the ability to gain knowledge quickly. The main downside is that a minority of computer users don't get enough exercise. It is my opinion that computers are good for and the pros definitely outweigh the cons.
1472	1476	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am aware that more people use computers everyday. I think that computers do have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computers help us by giving information about things in other countries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live too far of a distance where you can't see them. Computers give information about the latest and most recent things that happen in other towns countries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn't see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn't find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldn't want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you connect with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That may not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like being united with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friends close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people may dislike them but they have good reasons why. More family time can be had but I think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising. Well my time is up here. Hope you liked what I said here and you'll have a passion for computers.
1473	1477	1	3	I believe that computers have a lot of effects on people for example there eyes, there body, there mind. First you eyes if you set next to the computer too close you eyes gets effected by the computer screen and you may lose your eyes and then you wouldn't be able to see or read or do a lot of fun stuff like playing as you want to set near the computer or not. Second your body if you set on the computer for a whole day and not exercise you will get fat in other word you body will become fat and you will not be able to ran and do a lot of stuff and so are you just set on the computer for the whole day or not. Third is you mind if you watch on you computer like a video or play a new game and you mind if only thinking about doing that and then when you go to school you will only be think about that and you will forget every thing you wanted to do at you thinking about because of that. Finally I am telling every one to not spent too much time on the computer and be exercising and fun act side are working on you school work and doing homework and exercise and I want everyone to have a good life and stay healthy.
1474	1478	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathematics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other constantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors. Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. They make it easier to see their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Lets say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away. You would halfway have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home. There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the rain forest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever changing sands of the sahara desert. You could learn about the greeks, archimedes, ancient egypt, or pacman, with a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together. So think, are computers really harmful? I believe they are a great benefit to our lives."
1475	1479	1	3	My opinion is computers should be used for many different purposes. One reason is chatting online with friends and family. Another reason is that if you are going far away and you know someone that can give you directions to where you are going then you can chat with them as they give you directions to where them as they give you directions to where your heading. Another reason is if you have family that does not live with you and you can't go an see them then you can chat with them. Another reason is that of your going somewhere and you don't know the weather for the next day then you can go online and find out what's the weather for that day. Also if people really want to exercise then they can go on there computer and go to youtube and do exercise from there computer. Also if you want to see the @CAPS1 then you can search it on your computer to see what's going on. Lastly if you don't think it's right for people to have computers then you should try to get one to see how much stuff you can do with it. You will be amazed. This is my reason why people should have computers to enjoy while chatting, watching @CAPS1 and many other stuff that you can't probably imagine. Also, maybe kids should not have computers but they can get one when they get older. Also, if kids need to search from school then they can also do that there are many reasons why people should get computers. That is my opinion about why people should have computers for communication, information, and entertainment.
1476	1480	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, etc., they don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flies when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probably be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well I'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep putting it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. People don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends etc. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time for a healthier, more balanced life.
1477	1481	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I would want computers because it benefits our society. It helps one learn about countries around the world and what's going on. For example if you wanted to know about a country's sports, you can just type in its name. Also a computer can help you with your education. If you were working on a homework assignment and you needed some help you can just go on the computer for research and guidance. It is also very beneficial because students can have lots of fun playing games on the computer; say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. It is also a good way to communicate with your friends. For example, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, and email are all good sources of communication. Also it is good for if you have an Xbox or a PlayStation you need a computer; you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. It's good to have computers in school. If teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. It is also a good resource because in school if you're working on this big project a computer can help you do it efficiently. I hope these are all good reasons to have computers in our society, and it will benefit us in a number of different ways by enhancing learning, communication, and entertainment.
1478	1482	1	3	More people tend to use computer's more than going outside enjoying the weather, and I think people should spend less time on the computer and more time interacting with whom ever. People spend most of their time talking to people on any websites or playing online games. I think that it's a bad habit; people of all ages spend their time doing that when they can do something fun, but chose not to. Parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous. There has been many people who have been hurt. Raped on websites such as Facebook, Myspace, and many other dangerous websites. In my belief I would say that children and adults talk to strangers and think they know that person so well, meet them some place and get killed or anything because many people lie about their age. And who knows that person can be a fifty year old woman or man saying they're a teen and end up finding you. That is why parents should not let their children be on for a long period of time and should monitor what they are doing online. While you are reading this I hope you understand why it's wrong and take my suggestion under consideration and help us young kids to stay safe from online dangers.
1479	1483	1	3	To the Editor, this letter concerns how computers are a part of our daily life. You can do many things on them such as play games, watch videos, search the web, and even communicate with people from all over the world. They are very useful for people who go to school because you can complete and save work for your classes, making organization easier. Sure maybe some people are addicted to the computer but others use it only when they need to for important tasks. Computers have a massive affect on some peoples life. Sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but informative in many ways. One of the informative ways is that you learn new information every time you log on, discovering facts and news from around the globe. That is why I think the computer has a great effect on people, providing both valuable resources and potential challenges that we must manage wisely.
1480	1484	1	3	"Over ninety percent of the town owns at least one computer in their house. Computers benefit society because they help the earth, and are a fast way to spread important information. Also you can talk with friends and family on computers. We have been told that some people think were spending too much time on the computer. Yes, but we need these machines to survive in the modern world. News Center took a poll and said ""more than half of the town's schools are now using computers to put homework on to save paper"". If we start using computers to do things that we usually use paper for we would be saving millions of trees. For example you can send an email instead of snail mail, the mail would go faster and save paper! People who care about the earth make websites on the computer to inform people how to help the environment. Instead of driving just to see each other they could mail and talk all they want. Also if you like to use cellphone a lot the waves kill approximately millions of bees a year. If you chatted with your friends on a computer it would save bees lives. On the first snow day my parents forgot to check the schools website and I was out in the snow; if we didn't have computers this would happen to every little student on snow days. If there was a storm and you needed information, that is another place you can check to get the weather and keep your family safe. If there was a hurricane and the power was out, for important dates like birthdays and weddings your computer has a calendar on it that tells you whenever you write something on it. Town citizens spend over a million dollars a year on phone bills. You can talk to friends and family on the computer and save thousands. When parents don't have phones they rely on computers to communicate with people. Have your kids ever had a friend who moved away and your kids miss them? Well they can talk and see each other while on video chat and it will feel like they are still here. Its now or never citizens of our town! You know computers help the earth, they're a fast way to spread information, and they let you talk and see your friends online. So get up and write our local news paper telling them why computers benefit our society for efficiency, economy, and environmental care."
1481	1485	1	3	Dear local newspaper, did you know that just about @PERCENT1 of the people in the @LOCATION1 have computers and use them daily. I am one of those people and I don't get how people are saying that computers are destroying our country, yeah I know that we spend a little less time with family and friends but computers help us help monitor weather and natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes, they give us a chance to see far away places and learn more about the world and we can talk with other people. Computers are way important in our world because we can monitor natural @CAPS1 such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes; without this technology over @PERCENT2 more people will die from these @CAPS1 without computers because there will be less or no warning about the dangerous situation. Over @PERCENT3 of kids in the @CAPS2.S go to school and with computers the kids get a better chance to learn about the world and society. Kids should know what is going on in the world, or you could be an adult just browsing the web looking for information. My point is tons of people all around the world use computers to learn. My last reason is to teach kids to type and to have hand eye coordination; when kids get older and when we get @CAPS3 they are gonna need to learn how to type. So odds are if you don't know how to type you won't get very far out there in the real world. To conclude my statement I'm gonna go over my three reasons why we need computers: first to track natural disasters, second to learn about far away places and our society, and third to teach children hand eye coordination and to type so they can get @CAPS3. This is why the @CAPS2.S really needs computers.
1482	1486	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I understand that more and more people use computers, and that can have a good side and a bad one. Do you go on the computer for hours every day? That could be bad. I believe computers are a good thing, but only if they are used properly. Hopefully when I'm done, you'll see where I'm coming from on this matter. Everyone is on the computer these days. The problem is, many people are on way too much. They say they are working on hand-eye coordination, but in reality they are wasting away their lives on a chair. They do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big, happy family. They say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and viruses. Bad people are out there, and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day. Things like @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6 could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you. Yes, being on the computer definitely has a bad side. But there is a good side as well. That is, as long as you are not on too much. It does improve hand-eye coordination, if you play the right games. And it can teach you things, too. Many websites have true information about places or things so you don't need to see it to know about it. You can be helpful to others. It is also an easy way to purchase items. You can just order them online. Most importantly, you can have fun and relax. So, what is your side on this argument? Do you think way too many people are on the computer? Or do you think computers can be great, as long as you're careful? I, for one, pick the latter one. What about you?
1483	1487	1	3	Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or whatever you use to talk to your friends. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be very interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but that's not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places without going there, but then what would be the fun of that? For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, don't you feel great when you're going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful; I am thankful to god for giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, gorgeous. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else or even riding your @CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but because of the computer they got that which really stinks. Now as you can see computers really can change your life. So that's your decision. Pick wrong from right, all up to YOU. Now make it.
1484	1488	1	3	I think that computers are very valuable and help a lot of people. I think that computers should be used for information that could help students with their homework or to study for a test and also for adults to look up things such as directions, addresses, and prices of clothes and other items. They are also good because they help you communicate with friends and help people make plans with friends. However some people should limit themselves on things like Facebook and Twitter; some people spend too much time on those things and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes a day on those sites. One of the reasons I think computers are good is because some students might not know the answer to something on their homework and could use the computer to find out the answers. Another reason why computers can be very valuable to all students is because let's say a student has a quiz on mitosis and cells in science the next day and doesn't really understand it; they could use the computer to learn about it and do good on their quiz. Another reason that computers are good for people is because it helps them communicate with their friends. Some kids are lonely and aren't that good at interacting with people in person. But these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and help them make more friends. However like I said earlier some people get carried away and spend too much time doing this kind of stuff and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes per day on these social networking sites. Some people use their computers for other important things like buying things and getting directions and addresses. If somebody wants to go to a store in a different town but didn't know where it was they could look up the address and then find the directions to that place; some people also use the computer to purchase things like groceries and clothes. Sometimes people save money because they buy something online on sale rather than going to a store and paying more money. As you can see the computer has a lot of positives. Therefore I encourage you to support computers, because they are so useful and valuable in our daily lives.
1485	1489	1	3	Dear local newspaper, In my opinion I feel like too many people spend too much time on the @ORGANIZATION1. People are getting obese because they're not getting enough exercise. Children are going on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of doing their homework. Maybe perhaps a family member is dying and you rather spend time on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of with that family member. All of these things are happening because of the computers everyone is getting. This cannot be true! That over @PERCENT1 of the people in New @CAPS1 say that they are putting on a lot of weight and turning obese. I asked them what they think is causing this to happen. Someone named @PERSON1 said the reason is the computers; they're taking over people's lives. The computer is the enemy of the people that it is affecting most in life. Me as a child, the @ORGANIZATION1 is throwing me off of my homework. I used to have A's and B's on my report card only. Right now it turned into @CAPS2 and @ORGANIZATION1's are changing my life drastically but not in a good way. As you know it your child could be going through the same terrible things as me. You should start to check their homework instead of them just going on their @ORGANIZATION1 and forgetting all about their school work like I did. Try and prevent this. Tears running down your face and feeling disappointed in yourself. The one you love could pass you by and you did not even spend time with he or she. Once again the thing that is called @ORGANIZATION1 did this. The decisions that you made because of the @ORGANIZATION1 would and is going to scare you for life. We the people that have computers would find out that they were never made for a good purpose just to destroy what we do and how we spend times with our families and friends. Turn your head and say no to the one thing that would wreck you into little pieces. How do you feel? I feel bad because I let something so little mess up my life. You still have time to change your life and say no to the computers. They could make you turn obese because you are not getting enough exercise. The one you love could be messing up because of the @ORGANIZATION1 that you have in your house. The worst thing of all is you were not able to spend time with the family member that you love the most. The computers that we have are messing up your life as you know it. Just say no to the computers and live your life the best way that you could. Don't you feel bad that you let something so little ruin your life!?!
1486	1490	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, The effects computers have on people is that people rely on them and that's not good because they have less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First of all, having less time exercising is not good because @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people end up fighting obesity. ""You don't want to be one of those people trust me"" said @PERSON1, highlighting the serious health risks. Second, enjoying nature is a good thing to do instead of playing with a computer because you get your daily dose of fresh air by enjoying nature. ""You also have a lot of fun"" said @LOCATION1, emphasizing the joy found outdoors. Lastly, interacting with family and friends is fun and who doesn't love that. ""Spending time with the family is fun cause you get to go places,"" said @PERSON3. ""Who doesn't love going out and spending time with friends on the weekends,"" said @PERSON2. Those are my reasons why the effects computers have on people are not good, as they pull us away from these vital and fulfilling activities."
1487	1491	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 and readers @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 a modern world sent back in time to the @NUM1 quickly drive your car to get groceries but must ride damage for hours to simply buy some milk.

1488	1492	1	3	Dear local news paper, I think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age. Starting at thirteen and up through adulthood. People spend hours at a time on the computer when they canbe exercising or doing some type of activity out doors. Computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away form them. Spending so much time on a computer can really damage a person posture. It is said that when some get on a computer a state of comfortbility comes over them and they lean over with their backs bent and they there for periods of time. Imagin a person being cramped in a tight space for eight hours and when that person gets out they all their joints and muscles being stretched from that point of tensions. This is what we do to our bodys when we get on computers, subjecting them to prolonged strain and discomfort that can lead to long-term physical problems.
1489	1493	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers do benefit society in a positive way. Without computers we would not be able to be as social. We also would not have the ability to do reseach for school online and running a business would be even more difficult. Without computers our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. the main way of being social these days, other than texting, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a skype and facabook, and I am able to access them everyday. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and texting. Everyday I workout and lift weights and go on facebook, that is why that whole statement, ""spending less time exercising, and more time on the computer"" is false. Facebook and skype are a past of my everyday life and without them I know I would not be as social. Computers are also a part of my everyday life, because I have to use it to do research for school or typing up an @CAPS5 paper. As you have now seen, my handwriting is not so great, so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it. Without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work. Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade, which is not as presentable. Overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework. Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers some businesses would be unable to function, and those could function, would be awful slow. Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers, if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined. Computers also simplify work for businesses, they speed up the tasks that would takes a long time to be hand done and they complete the tasks that could not be acheived without a computer. Computers play a large part in the @CAPS6 of the world, driving progress and connectivity in nearly every aspect of modern life."
1490	1494	1	3	Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with, making them an indispensable part of our lives.
1491	1495	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I agree with the experts that people spend too much time on the computer; people should be exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. But people are so lazy and would rather be sitting and doing something on the computer, and if they don't start doing other things instead of being online they could become overweight. My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercise. Seriously, people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing, and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy. My second reason why I think people should spend less time online is because you should be spending time with your friends and family, not ignoring them because you're doing something on the computer. That's just rude, so why don't you go and have a family game night or go out to eat with your family, and you could also watch a movie, go skating, or even go to the park with your friends because that's a lot more fun than being online all day. My last reason why people should spend less time online is because everyone should have time to just read a good book; honestly, just walk down to your local library and check out a book because reading is way better for your brain than doing stupid stuff on the computer. So in conclusion, in my opinion, I think people should spend less time online because if you don't get enough exercise you can become overweight and lazy, and not spending a lot of time with your friends and family is just rude, and reading is very good for you unlike staying on the computer. Well, that is all I have to say for now.
1492	1496	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 that humanity has, has its ups and downs and its positives and negatives. The same is true with technology. It has its ups and downs, but because of it our society grows increasingly advanced. It gives us the opportunity to grow more sophisticated and to set our goals beyond reach. We make the start of great things with these tools. Computers teach us and sometimes can guide you. You can click on a link and find an amazing opportunity or click on the wrong one and get a virus. Computers can get you away from all the stress in your life and take you to a beautiful place; it can give you the chance to let you learn something that you didn't even know existed. Ultimately, technology is a powerful force that shapes our world in complex ways.
1493	1497	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Are you aware that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 families have ownership of a computer? Maybe so, but were you informed that at least half of that @PERCENT1 have family issues or such related problems? The issue in question is if computers have a positive effect or negative effect on mankind. In @CAPS4 opinion, I feel that this invention is taking a negative toll on society. I say this because now-a-days there are inappropriate websites that children should not view, and it takes away time with family, but mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue. Without a doubt, youngsters are experts with a website; we'll just do as we were told, and maybe we could find one by an accident. Who knows? All I know is, there are too many to count adult websites that children from the ages of @DATE1 log on to everyday. This is unacceptable and is a reason why we should be prohibited on computers. No responsible parent would be caught dead with a @NUM1 year old on an adult website, and computers make it harder for such parents to do so. With such experiences, computers take away time with family; when I had my computer, we never spent time with her. She said the other day, ""Do I peel bananas? If I never got on the computer, you would be right now,"" and she was right. Whenever my brother and I got on the computer we would stay on all day. But every time we've been together much more now, and I feel that computers have a negative effect on society is because of the recent @CAPS3 issue. I was called to the office one day to be informed that a crew on @CAPS3 com had befriended me and they were using boys and girls for drugs and prostitution. People take advantage of computers and end up reading people's info. This could have been prevented but it wasn't. Now it's your chance; I hope you will feel the same way as me when it comes to the negatives and positives of computers. But remember, computers have too many websites that aren't good for young kids, it takes away time from family, but mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue."
1494	1498	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, I would like to make a statement about the benefits of owning a computer. For example, you can learn many things you would never have been able to, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people, and it can even make teaching easier too. Computers in many countries are standard, and we use them to learn many things; but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like an alien object, but once they know how to use it, it can open their eyes forever. Many people in remote tribes and areas don't even know there's been a man on the moon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards, and other payments, which is good so if you can't get out of your house or the place is closed you won't get late fees, and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online websites such as @CAPS1, Twitter, and Myspace where you can talk, view pictures, and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Furthermore, many people play games on the computer; some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. You can also hook other gaming systems up to your computer to play with other people and even get hints and cheats too. The biggest reason that computers are beneficial, though, is that they revolutionized school; now for homework, instead of doing a worksheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and homework much easier, more readable, and it can give you a much broader view of the topic. By far the best thing about the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore, it is much easier to learn and understand things, which will help us in the future be successful. Also, many kids pay less attention when a teacher is giving a lecture, but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students' attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is an excellent invention and every family and school should own one; I hope you will find my statement very persuading and publish it.
1495	1499	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 your latest article on the goods and bads of computers in our society was informative, I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consequences, who knows where our world is heading? First off, I'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, but especially computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that ""@CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've seen a drastic spike in obesity-related heart disease and diabetes."" And @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Because of the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or @CAPS5 than going for a bike ride or playing a game of fastball with friends. Because of this, more and more people become victims of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone issues that could leave them paralyzed for the rest of their life. Is playing that online game so important to you that it's worth your life? Next, I'd like to touch on the fact that @CAPS1 the internet may seem like a great place to do some socializing, it can actually aid in losing friends instead of making them. I know what you're thinking, @PERSON2, 'But sites like '@CAPS6' help people connect, why would they lose friends?' Think about it, really. Since it's so easy to type in a conversation, people are losing actual social skills. They also spend too much time talking to friends without meeting face-to-face, and that eventually causes them to drift apart. And when talking to someone over a screen, it's so hard to know if you're actually close friends. Because of this, they can't bond and they won't have a real friendship. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 year old at @ORGANIZATION1, says that him and his best friend now only talk over @CAPS3, and they don't even feel like true friends anymore. So finally, I have a request. Next time you turn on that laptop, think. Is this really worth losing your friends and even your health? Next time you feel the urge to update your status with something like '@CAPS8 got home,' call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for the time to read my letter."
1496	1500	1	3	Dear local Newspaper editor, More and more people are using computers, but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Other experts disagree. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they let you learn about anything all over the world, they let you talk online with other people, and teach hand eye coordination. I think that computers are very helpful. Dont you love having the oppritunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about? I'm sure that everyone who has a computer does. With computers, you can use search engines like, google, yahoo, ask, and so many more. I know that computers help me with research all the time when I do projects or write papers for school. The internet is a great, reliable resource that you can go to when researching a topic for school or even just looking for an answer to a simple question, providing instant access to a vast library of information. My next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online. Things like facebook, email, myspace, and web-caming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world. For example, I have an aunt that lives in @LOCATION1, and on christmas me and my family used my cousins webcam to see her and talk to her when we couldnt be with her on a special holiday. Also, things like facebook and myspace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world, helping to maintain close relationships despite physical distance. My last reason why I think computers have a positve effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure time activity. There are all kinds of fun games you can play, and some even let you compete with other people around the world. For example, internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else. There are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection, offering entertainment for all different interests. Its obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family and leisure activities. I hope you agree with me that they are a beneficial part of modern life.
1497	1501	1	3	Do you think that computer's are good? Well, I do. There are many reasons why I and you should think, this. For example, it has possitive effect on people, it teaches hand-eye coordination, and it allows people to talk to online with other people. One reason why you should think that computers are good is it has a positive effect on people!! Don't you want to be happy. well then, computers is your online fun source!! And your an learn a lot from computer, discovering new interests and hobbies. Another reason is that the computers teaches hand-eye coordinbation. Hand-eye coordination is excellent skill that you need in life. For example, lets say that you want to play baseball, and you have no hand-eye coordination and you trip and @DATE1 and you brake something. that isn't good for you, is it. No, it is not good. But, if you had better hand-eye coordination then you probably wouldn't have fallen! Many computer games require quick reflexes and precise control, which helps to develop this important skill over time. The @NUM1 reason is that, you can interact with others online. You can @CAPS1, you can go on chat rooms. Or you can go on gaming sources, and interact with other people!! And, you can go online dating! The computer is a greet way to meet new people that share the same characteristics as you, expanding your social circle. If you already have a computer then your fine. But, if you don't then you need to get one. And I am right!! People that don't have a computer have no jb. because people with jobs most of the time have use or have computer. In conclusion, you need to get a computer!! Why? well, that because you can alot of stuff on a computer. For example, you can teach hand eye coordition, and you can chat with online friends. Also, it gives you a possitive effect and opens up a world of opportunities.
1498	1502	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that with too much use of computer it will have bad affects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also use a lot of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad affects computers have, but their not all bad, without them life might be a little harder. Playing computer games, and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them everyday. Online poker could be dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in debt. Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop. It's a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addicting too. There's a website that called addicting. I guess people don't know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family, leading to neglect of personal relationships. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 goes to computer? Thats almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic chrisis I don't think enery should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people any need. If everyone didn't need computers to communicate and everything there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. I understand emailing, and facebook. But don't get out of hand with it. Isnt being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or excercise rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not excercising. I remember when I was younger, everytime I went to my friends house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most @CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I would define they rather excersise or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer it can have bad affects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family over a screen?
1499	1503	1	3	"Dear newspaper editor, I think we should have internet, or computers at our houses. We should have it because we can chat with our friends and family, noone would get bored doing nothing and we learn new things from different websites. We should be able to communicate to our friends and family @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in our school think having a computer is good. For example my friend moved to @LOCATION1, we couldn't talk on the phone. It was long distance I talk to her over facebook. There are a lot of websites you can talk on like facebook, twitter or even myspace you can even skype. skype is when you have a webcam and you talk threw it, making conversations feel more personal and real. My mom said that most of her friends chat online with her. It doesn't matter how old are you. Anyone can learn important things. There are a lot of websites that are educational @PERCENT1 things on the computer are worth having. If you are old and you can't go to school just go to google and type any math term, science, @CAPS1, or even learning a new language. Everytime I have to do my social studies homework I go online trust me it's really helpful, as it offers explanations and resources that textbooks sometimes lack. Some things on the computer are very fun. You won't get bored on the type of games they have. A lot of parents complain that their children are doing bad things in the streets. The do there kind of things, because are bored @NUM3 people think that statement is true. If they had a computer, and playing games, or talking to friends, they would be like they are, safely occupied at home. @STATE1 and @PERSON1 are two state that have more people that go on the computer than any others states. Remember it's not only fun. Everyone enjoys having a computer. I think we should have internet access because we can do a lot of things some people think it's bad, but not everything is. We should have a computer, because, we can chat with friends, we can learn important and interestings things and we won't get bored. I hope you made up your mind and decided that all internet access is not a waste of time. I'm not the only one that thinks that "" a computer is what keeps or alive"" and connects us to the wider world."
1500	1504	1	3	When people think about computers the first thing they think of is games. Thats not all they are good for. For most people they are very usefull. Computers are great for @ORGANIZATION1. At @ORGANIZATION1 they help with homework and projects. When we are assigned a project we need to do research on a topic and the fastest and easier way is by computer. The students at @ORGANIZATION2, especially @NUM1 graded, are able to type up easys because it's faster and alot easier, allowing for neat and organized work. If we are at home and we forgot our homework we could look it up online. This can be really helpful and convient to students and teachers, saving time and reducing stress. Sometimes it's not @ORGANIZATION1 but its finding things. Technology and computers have came a long way. Now we can look up directions to places we dont or cant find. People can also finding names, numbers, or address useing websites like yellow pages can be a relieable resource for that. Say your going for vaction and your try to find somewhere to stay it could be tough but there are websites you can go on were if you want something fast or mabye a nice hotel for a low price you can find it, making travel planning much simpler. The computer can be very fan and intersting when you go places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and you want to show picture of the great time you had so you can post them online. Say you havent talked to and old friend in a while, you can look for them on @CAPS3 or another website and start talking agian you can also play games and connect with friends or play games with friends while online, strengthening those bonds. Weather its @ORGANIZATION1, finding things, or connecting with frends the computer has what ever you need. Maybe it will at one point get damged but they have people who can fix it. Plus if you think about it computers have very reliable resourses that are more updated then books, providing the most current information available at your fingertips.
1501	1505	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 of the students and staff members of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 school find computers verry important. Computers not only help people in school but at home too, providing essential tools for both work and leisure. I know that the readers of this artical will agree that computers are verry helpful, they teach us about people and things far away, and they are great for chating online! Most people use compoters every day for a variety of essential tasks. Computers are verry helpful tools in every day life. They always have a program that if you spell something wrong it corrects you, which is invaluable for writing. Computers even have websites of a dictionary were people can look up words quickly and efficiently. I know this is verry helpful because my brother is writing his collige essays and their are no colliges that will be impressed by a gramaticly incorrect essay. Computers also help you find things you need really fast, like food restrants and the closest malls, or even jobs, saving a significant amount of time. Not only do computers help people with spelling and jobs but they also can teach us about far away places. Computers can show and tell us of wonderful places beond what we have scean, bringing the world into our homes. A lot of normal societys familys have been on vacation before. To find an intriging place to go they can look it up on the world wide web, comparing destinations and prices. Even if a family cant go on a vacation they can still find from their computer cheeper closer things to do, discovering local attractions. When computers are beig used to find places and thing across the world and near you is they can also give teens the oppritunity to chat with their friends online. A lot of students in @CAPS3 hallow school have a facebook account. Most use this account to talk to their friends online, sharing updates and photos. I also have a facebook and I use it almost everyday to talk to my cousin from @LOCATION1 that I havent scean sence I was @NUM3, which helps us stay connected. But, computers arent just used for fun chating they can also be used for school blogs. In my language arts class we have a reading blog that every student has to participate in. This blog allows the class to not wast class time to talk about recently read books, continuing the discussion outside of school. In conclusion computers should be taken seriosly because they do help society in numerous ways. Computers help us every day, they teach us and they can be verry fun and eductional, making them indispensable. Remember what @PERSON1 from the department of tecnolgey at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS5 can only get better if socitey accepts it,"" and this applies to computers as a vital part of our modern world."
1502	1506	1	3	"Computers can affect people in many ways, both positively and negatively. Most people use computers too much and it can affect their health and the peole around them. People need to get out side and get more active instead of being constantly indoors. America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer, which is a troubling trend. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any, creating a cycle of poor health. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day, but computer use often replaces this vital activity. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes, as it can be a useful tool. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new things? I dont live by the woods but you can go to a local park; all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time, which is beneficial for your body and mind. Familys are constantly having problems about family members who never have time to talk and funch holes in walls for losing a video game, showing how technology can fuel anger. Dr. @PERSON1 or ""The studies of the human mind"" says ""I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people."" That goes to show it can cause problems in familys everywhere because of a video game, disrupting household harmony! So please make sure you try to spend time with your family in person, fostering real connections. So that shows that the computer can be fun, but also dangerous if not used in a balanced and mindful way, and we must be cautious of its effects on our lives."
1503	1507	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 writers, @CAPS3 are an avrage of @NUM1 computers per house. That is just too much for a single household to manage healthily. I think society is too much time in computers, leading to various negative consequences. Computers are taking over our life and dictating our daily routines. Spending time on the computer runs up the electric bill, adding a financial strain. Computers are one of the leading problems with weight and you are isolated and less interesting with society when on the computer for extended periods. @CAPS4 you spend too much time on the computer you run up your electric bill; do you realy want to be spending @NUM2$ in a month or would you rather get groceries, or even pay bills with that money? "" On avrage a family who used less computers saved @MONEY1 than a family that spends more time on thier computer,"" according to a recent study. ""@CAPS4 if I knew how much I save I would decanated computer"" says a gamer, ""I didn't know how much my hobbie was costing me."" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 is the problem with modern life, creating dependency. The worst problem with computers is you dont interact with society in a meaningful way. @CAPS4 you spend most of your time on the computer you wont have alot of friends in real life, only virtual ones. You might have online friends but in real life you have few people to call or visit. I have few hobbies other than play on the computer, which is a common issue. I think society is spending too much time in the computer, leading to isolation. Computers cause problems such as the electrisity bill, when you use the computer excessively, you gain weight and dont participate with society, so get off that computer and engage with the real world around you for a healthier and more fulfilling life."
1504	1508	1	3	Computers. Theres fun to be had. But there's also a down side that cannot be ignored. People spent more time on it than outside or exersizing or even getting together with friends and family, which harms social bonds. But on ther hand, they're also fun, help kids learn, and even help get people together from dating sites, fostering new relationships. It makes them happy and provides entertainment. It's fun! Computers are fun, there is no denying it. They provide a wide arrow of games, educational options and just plain fun activities for all ages. You can play role playing games (which are engaging and fun because I play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on islands, or other downlodabal education games that are, @CAPS1 not only fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child, building their skills. They also can help kids learn how to read and do other things at a very early age, giving them a head start. Some very adults have found companionship and various other things that I cannot the life of me think of, but computers facilitate these connections. @CAPS2 thing computer get them together and they are happy, forming communities online. They do this hundreds of times a day, connecting people across distances. Take away computers and people will die alone and sad, lacking these modern connections. so in conclusion my ideas where that computers provide fun, help kids learn, and help older people get together, making them a valuable part of life despite the drawbacks. Read this and @CAPS3 sure you'll see it my way, recognizing the balanced role computers play in our society.
1505	1509	1	3	Hi my name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing to the local news paper to say that computers are good for people and helps alot like how to get one place two another, how to learn about black history or famous people that did something to the world, and how to find out the news and weather from home or at work, how to keep your besnness going without computers their jobs would be hopless, and like of your family or you tyring to make it in life and the only way to get in contact would be the computers there are computers every where even doctors use them at a hospital to keep people alive to see what wrong with them and where they came from, and one more jobs need computers to, to see if the person is capable for the job so they might look for background information with out it even you would not have a good job so hee are some resons why computers are important. One of them is we need computers for navigation so that we can get around easily, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place, reading reviews and checking maps. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them, providing real-time updates. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do for comprehensive research. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want, staying informed conveniently. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long, as they are crucial for operations. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits or losses @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers, leading to chaos. There lots of more stuff that coulf have said that prove computers are good and why we need them but i just had to cut it short and schools need computers the most to take test on the computers of they have to, so thats all the resons why we need computer and why they are good for modern life, making them an essential tool for progress and connection.
1506	1510	1	3	I personally believe that computers do benefit society in a lot of ways. It can give you all the information you need with just a click of a button, entertainment is easy to find by searching the internet, and most importantly, it improves communication between people. One way computers benefit society is by making it easier for everyone to get information about something. This is needed, especially in school, where students can quickly access online encyclopedias and educational websites to help them get their information about the person they are writing about in their report. Getting information easily on the internet can also help people in other ways. What if someone needed to get the hospital's phone number in case of an emergency? He can use the computer to help him find that phone number quickly and reliably. Another way computers benefit society is by allowing us to get any form of entertainment easily. This is what the majority of the people in our society rely on. A lot of people use the computer to play games, listen to music, and watch online videos on various platforms. If someone was bored right now, he or she could use the computer to play fun games. What if that person thought it was a little quiet in his or her room? He or she could then use the computer to listen to music from a vast online library. Without computers we would probably be really bored for the rest of our lives. Finally, and most importantly, computers help improve communication between people. This is probably what everyone uses the computer for. Now you can send electronic mail to your friends in just seconds, post and view pictures of your family or relatives on social media, and you can even use an instant messenger to write to your friend and get messages from your friend in the fastest speed possible! Without computers, communication between others would be very hard and much slower. As you can see, computers can give you information easily, entertainment is not hard to find, and it can even improve communication between people around our society and the world! Computers are very helpful to us and improves everything about the way we live and connect with one another.
1507	1511	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer has been a resource we have been using for years and gives you information and pictures but that doesn't mean people have to be on it all the time. People can talk some times with other people or go on the webcam to see a loved one who's in Iraq but the need to go outside to exercise just to take a walk around the block remains important. They don't even need to leave the house all the time just exercise to a tape or get a treadmill for a good workout. Thats all people need to do instead sitting on their butts all day move around and get the blood flowing. People becoming obese has risen because of lack of exercise so grab your shoes and go jog a couple blocks in your neighborhood just do little things and you will feel much better than you were on your computer. Nature is all around us but most people don't notice because their on the computers. Which needs to end now these beautiful land marks across the world are being wasted because hardly any ones looking at them. Go to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, even @CAPS1 and get some fresh clean air thats not from your home you can go to the park to just look at the birds just see something without a screen on it. So go get your camera and go some where with wild life and have fun exploring the outdoors. Just doing these things will help your health, energy and your mind by giving you a break from the digital world. You can go on the computer and chat with friends but not all the time. Do you want to be unhealthy in life if not go outside and take a walk to experience the world beyond the screen.
1508	1512	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I have been informed that people don't get to talk to friends and family, enjoy nature and exercise because of computers. Well computers benefit our life in many ways. The first thing about computers is communication. People can use @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and etc to stay in touch. The social networking groups are for abilities to talk to friends, long distance or close and family enjoy research and sharing life updates. Just because @CAPS11 use those internet websites doesn't mean @CAPS11 can't go outside and enjoy activities as well. This leads to other objects called portables. As technology advances so does our skills and the tools we use. Every year more electronics are made and most likely are portable such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6 phones, @CAPS7, and etc. Many of these companies let us take these devices to allow as to do everyday things from anywhere. With @ORGANIZATION1 creater of the @CAPS8 @CAPS11 can use this internet and music @CAPS9 for everything they need. For example, I visit my grandparents and I decided to bring my @CAPS6 phone. I can talk to friends on my @CAPS6 phone by texting and still visit my grandparents at the same time. More of this applies to the @CAPS5 where @CAPS11 can still all go outside and enjoy life while being connected. Exercise is something @CAPS11 should yet to do regularly. If you stay crammed in your house you miss out on @CAPS12 fun. @CAPS11 need to cheer up and go outside and play sports like soccer or basketball. @CAPS11 could get included in and join a community activity or a local team. @CAPS11 also can have videos online to show us how to exercise properly or use yoga for flexibility. Most of use portables which goes back to my last paragraph about convenience. Exercise is big and @CAPS11 all should do it for their well-being. What I'm trying to say here is that @CAPS11 can use computers and electronics and exercise with fun all in one balanced lifestyle. If you understand this, experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate effectively with others.
1509	1513	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to tell you I think that computers are a good thing because they let people communicate, tons of people have jobs because of computers and people have help with homework because of computers. People communicate by email and instant messaging services and social media platforms like facebook and everything else, allowing them to stay connected across distances. People have jobs on computers like court reporters and tax preparers and sales people who work remotely or in offices using these systems. Lastly kids do homework on the computer and look up stuff for school projects that is ""@CAPS1 related"" on the computer and for other research tasks just like that. They can find information for essays and presentations quickly. Lastly I think computers are good for people, they help with education, work and comunication with friends and family, making daily life more efficient and connected."
1510	1514	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion I support the advances in technology. Advances in technology helps us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is because computers and phones can help us get information on things we need to get information on. We need to know what is going on around us, all the time, from local news to global events. We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives through social media updates and news feeds. We need to know the weather and traffic conditions for our daily commute; if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co-worker sent you anything important that you need to know about for your job. The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online through video calls and messaging apps. We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have a computer or a smartphone. Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy, even though we can't see them in person, and technology bridges that gap. I, for one, know this is fact because my family and friends keep in touch with each other online regularly. Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our bonds strong over time and distance. The last reason why I support advances in technology is because computers can help us with our reading and hand-eye coordination skills through interactive activities. Computers can help our reading skills because if we don't have time to go to the bookstore to get a book, we can read the book online for free from digital libraries. It can help our hand-eye coordination because it can help our fingers move faster on the keyboard and help us do things faster and more accurately. I stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills for a better and more connected life.
1511	1515	1	3	"Dear newspaper editor: We are all living in the age of technology. There are many useful devices that help us live our every day lives. The computer is a major help. We can talk with relatives from different areas and you can surf the internet to learn new information. Furthermore, you can play games with people from around the world. The computer is a great device. Almost everyone has a relative that lives in another state or country. Well, you never see them because they live far away, right? With a computer you can talk and even have a face to face conversation with them. This can bring your family closer together. For example, my family just got a new computer and we have relatives that live in Florida that we almost never see. With the computer my dad talks to them almost everyday. Some people that I have talked to said that they are excited to see their relatives or friends more often. It has brought them closer together and made them better friends. The internet is a wonderful place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics. When kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search for it online and this saves time. A large percentage of kids said that when they are doing a project the best thing to use would be the internet. Furthermore, it helps the kids work faster so they can spend more time outside or hanging out with their friends. Another thing you can do is learn about recent events. For example, most local newspapers have a website that you can visit. Even if your local paper does not you can go to other websites like ""CNN"". They have recent events that happen around the country and around the world. The internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life. Every kid gets bored when it's a rainy day. So they can play games with people from around the world using a computer. There are many websites that have fun games that are fun and enjoyable. You can also become friends with people from other countries. My friends John and Sarah play on the computer and they have a lot of friends from other countries. I think that it's cool that you are playing the exact game with another person in Japan or Germany, and most of the games are safe and fun to play. Another thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your home town. I have many times played games with John and Sarah. It's a fun thing to do during a boring, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful device that benefits us and helps us with our everyday life. It allows us to connect with family in far away places and surf the internet for new information. Furthermore, you can play games with people from around the world. It's a wonderful device and let's start using it."
1512	1516	1	3	Dear local news, As more and more people use computers, people ask if computers actually benefit society. In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, access to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society and here is why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or their favorite television show on the internet. One of the most popular websites for watching videos is YouTube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their local store or play them on websites like Miniclip. You can see entertainment on the computer has a much more variety compared to the television, where a program is shown at a certain time instead of whenever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is access to daily uses; the internet provides services that can tell you your local weather. Instead of waiting for the local news, you can immediately access it on your computer. Furthermore, you can access encyclopedias and dictionaries at websites like Wikipedia, which provide an easy, immediate tool for daily uses. One last example towards the benefit of computers is social interaction. There are many websites that you can use. One of these websites is called Facebook; it lets you upload pictures of people or family events for people in your network. You can also video chat with people over the internet and see the other person's face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting on a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like Facebook it is actually adding time. In conclusion, these reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society. They provide entertainment, easy access to information, and have many websites for social interactions. Without them, society would be a lot harder and this is why I think computers benefit society.
1513	1517	1	3	Dear Editor, Having a computer is a benefit. They help us in so many ways. It is very helpful, and it could make someone's life easier to handle. You could keep in touch with old friends or family. It would be easier for work, and when you're bored, you could play some fun games. It's very hard to have family you can't see and keep in touch with! With a computer you could send messages and photos to interact with them. You wouldn't have to worry about ever losing communication with them. You could also meet new people. Get new friends from anywhere in the world! Have friends from all different races and cultures. Computers are a great way to interact with others, whether it's family or friends. It's always hard to do work when you have no clue what it's about! If you're ever having trouble on something you could always look up information about it. You could learn how to do things or learn more information about a certain item. When you have homework and don't know the meaning of a word, you could always look up the definition of it. They also hold your information. For example, instead of carrying a ton of papers you could simply just save it in your computer. Then you could print it out whenever you need it. Computers make work easier and help you organize better. Computers also amuse you as well. When you have nothing to do, you could play a lot of fun games. You could also watch music videos or funny videos to get you laughing. They have practically anything you want to play. You would hardly ever get bored! As you see, computers are a benefit to people. It's always helpful when you could keep in touch with anyone, have help with your work, or simply keep yourself entertained. Without computers life would be harder and more boring!
1514	1518	1	3	Dear School Newspaper Editor, Computers are a helpful advantage in the modern person's life. It offers and contributes many ideas and actions. Computers help people find a nice spot to travel. Also it helps people meet or make new friends. A computer is another way for people to get their hand-eye coordination better. Computers are very helpful in a human's life. Computers are useful when trying to explore new places. One can book a flight anywhere in a matter of minutes on a computer. How else would it be possible to travel someplace far away without booking a flight on a computer? Next, computers help you learn about different cultures. Once one has booked reservations to a certain travel spot on their computer, they will learn much about the unfamiliar land they have went to. My family has gone to many different areas around the world. The trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers. The computer makes it possible to experience new territories. It is a key item when someone is looking to travel. A computer is immensely important when trying to communicate with friends. People can meet and make friends very simply using websites such as Facebook on the computer. Facebook creates friendship very easily. I recently wanted to get to know a student better. I looked him up on Facebook and now we are acquaintances. Next, programs on the computers such as A.I.M. help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics. Lastly, if one wants to get to know another better he or she can look at their blog. They may start to talk and become good friends. Computers are useful when trying to communicate or find friends. Computers not only help with travel and friends but it also helps with one's hand eye coordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand eye coordination. This action can help with sports. For example in baseball one must have a good hand eye coordination to help catch and hit the ball. Secondly, with hand eye coordination getting better with the computer, it helps kids fit in. If one has good hand eye coordination they can play sports and make friends. If one becomes good with hand eye coordination and typing they will be able to get a job writing for a newspaper or a book. Hand eye coordination and typing with computers can lead to a successful life. Computers in a person's life can help in the long run. It will help with travel plans, friends, and hand eye coordination.
1515	1519	1	3	Dear School Newspaper Editor, I think that people are spending too much time on their computers and not exercising as they're supposed to do every day. A recent study says that a large percentage of all people in the entire world are spending too much time on the computer and not enjoying nature. So they don't get exercise like other people do. Another report says that people that go outside and not stare at their computers will live a long and healthy life. I say that a majority of all people that are always on the computer often go blind and will never see how the world is changing around them. I say that most people that don't always go on the computer will live a better life than the people that are always on the computer. My doctor told me that you should go on the computer, just not for a very long time because being on the computer for a very long time is not so good for you, so don't go on the computer for a very long time, only for a short amount of time and don't go on the computer every day, only like three times a week. People that have Facebook accounts shouldn't go on it every day; go on like one to three times a week because going on the computer for a very long time is not good for people. My eye doctor says that many people in the world have glasses and often go blind because of them using the computer all the time and that if you go on it for too long your computer will melt down and break. I really think that people shouldn't go on the computer for a very long time because every time they go on is a time that they will miss in life, so please don't do it.
1516	1520	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 have many debated on whether computers are good or bad. @CAPS6, I believe that computers aren't as good as many people think. Ever since computers were invented people haven't been exercising as much as they used to. Also less kids are reading books for enjoyment. Lastly computers are taking away valuable family time. When was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport? If you haven't it's probably because they are inside with their eyes glued to a computer screen. Exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit. More kids are becoming over weight everyday. Computer are just another reason why. I had a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer. She became very lazy and inactive. She never wanted to exercise or doing anything active. Little by little she started gaining weight. This is happening all around the world and it need to @CAPS4! What's your reading level? @CAPS3 are students in @NUM1 grade with a @NUM2 grade reading level. Part of the reason is because they rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book. Schools now do program called @CAPS5 @NUM3. This program is designed to help students improve their reading levels. I believe that if students would turn off the computers long enough and @CAPS5 we wouldn't need this program. My mom makes sure I @CAPS5 for at least @NUM4 mins everyday. Every student should do the same. I remember a saying ""family time is golden time"" @CAPS6, now a days no one spends time with their family. Once again computers have played a part in this too. It's not just kids who have droped family time for computer time. It's adults too. I think the last time I spent some time with my family was about @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit. After that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens. In conclusion, the computers are causing more harm than good in our daily lives."
1517	1521	1	3	I believe computers have a positive effect on people because computers can help people in many ways. You can e-mail friends from across the world, get important information you might need, and also you can do business online. Computers have fasinating things to show and inform. Most people that have computers can use them for e-mailing friends. Sometimes your closest friends are across the country & you want to talk to them. Why not e-mailing them on your computer? It would mean a lot to your friends it you just take time to say hello through e-mail. My second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because they provide access to information. Some middle school through college & the rest of you life need to use computers. Maybe because of some important information they might need for an assignment from a teacher. Not all the time you can find certain things in books. Now a days computers are taking over books. My third opinion for computers is that some people are to ill to go to work so they work online. Even though you are ill you will still be getting paid because you are still working. So women just had a baby & she is using her computer to work online. So she can make money so she can support her femily. In conclusion, my opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people because they are used for e-mailing friends, finding out important information for school purposes or job purposes, and for working online. To me, I think computers are a positive effect on people.
1518	1522	1	3	Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' schoolworks. Finally, you are able to talk with other people on-line. These are just a few points why computers are very importent, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind becasue you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convinient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in-laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, now-a-days they even have on-line tutors and on-line colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With videochat, chatrooms, facebook and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even on-line dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after mu uncle divoriced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those on-line dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way. In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic inevntion because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home, recieve help with your schoolwork, and talk with other people on-line. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time.
1519	1523	1	3	@CAPS1 you know we all like computers and we all use it for all different tyoes off things like to chat or to do work and most importantly to fine something but computers are in a way not that good for you especially if your computer is your life, one reason I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are on it for when you are on it for along time you get hungry then you get some snaks and by the time your done using the computer gained. A pound no imagin how much wiget you will gain if you do that every day alot! My next reason why I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are the computer too long your eyes start to hurt and your hands start to cramp and everything starts to hurt to much typing and looking at the same thing for along to can make you have eye problems and can also give you something in your hands and then you will not to be able to do anything with your hands for along time because it will start hurting. My last reason why i think computers in a way are bad because it can mess your computers up it can over heat or just down because you have ben on it for too long. It can also get a virese then you will just have to get a whole new computer @CAPS1 you can see there are plenty of reasons why I think computers are kinda bad for your health and your device.
1520	1524	1	3	Many people have been talking about computers in the @ORGANIZATION1. Networks like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS2 have be saying that the computers are turning the people in lazy goodd for notings. But I say different! I think the advances in technology is a good thing. Way? I'll give you @NUM1 reasons. My first reason is they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Next reason is makes life better. And my last reson is it give you hand-eye coordination @CAPS3't you sick of haveng to go to the book stor and find a book to do a project? well now with the computers you don't have to. You just go online and look up the info that you need to learn about almost anything form the use to @LOCATION1. Next reason is computers make life better by allowing you to connect with others and play games that improve your skills. In conclusion, computers are a beneficial tool for modern society.
1521	1525	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I was reading this article about computers. I agree with kids and adults not having time enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But, also, kids and adults should be having some fun time outside and enjoying it. But when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information. I think kids and adults need to get active and get healthy, because now kids don't want to play outside, so they can play video games instead. When I was a little kid I would always play hide and seek but now my mother doesnt like to play anymore because of technology she rather be on the computer or on the phone. Kids all over the world now know how to use computers because they don't want to be outside. Computers are only helful when your doing a report or something, important. For example, people that have businesses they are going to need computers for their work. Also when a teacher a sighs a project on someone your going to need a computer to search up information for that person. Finally alot of kids aren't taking responsibilty of school. They don't that school serious. Kids think that the computers will teach you everything well there wrong because things on the computer can be made up. But its also making there life very in healthy. So thats why computers are good usage and bad at time because kids don't play outside anymore and computer are helpfull for searching information so with these points in mind, I hope you see my perspective.
1522	1526	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a posotive effect on people. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. I think that both these opinions are correct. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habbit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. Using computers is something I know millions of people use everyday, and would think @CAPS2 would be difficult to live without. For example, my family owns four computers. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. For my mom, @CAPS2's usually working or checking her e-mails. For me and my sister, @CAPS2's researching and typing of homework, and communicating with our friends via facebook or other sites. So say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn new things. Before these were computers, everyone used books, but now that we have the internet, theres no really need to get a book. Most of the time people wont even have the book their looking for and either have to go out and buy get one from the library. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet thats quick, and easy. People also use computers to like I mentioned above with maybe facebook, @CAPS1, or e-mail.@CAPS2's quick, easy and fun. @CAPS2 also saves paper which helps the planet. We always use to send letters, but now with these sources, you don't need to use as much paper! Computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on them. Now even though I mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. So many people use computers everyday, and @CAPS2's bad for your physical and mental health. People spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. This means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. They wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. In conclusion, I'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, but also remember to go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements.
1523	1527	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 many people think comptuers are bad there are many reasons as to why they are good. Computers are very environmental friendly and so are @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people today. They also allow us to type assignments and other important papers. People also don't know that they are not the worst @ORGANIZATION1 on the market today. Computers @MONTH1 take away time from people that they should be spending on excersice, but computers arent the only thing that do that more people spend time watching @CAPS5 then they do on any other activity, @PERSON2 head @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a survey in @DATE1. His survey showed that out @DATE1 the @NUM1 people questioned @PERCENT2 spent @NUM2 hours a day watching @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 spent @NUM3 hours on the computer, @PERCENT4 spent @NUM4 hours reading and @PERCENT5 spent @NUM4 hours excersising. So clearly computers are not our biggest problem. Many people today are ""@CAPS7"" or ""@CAPS8-environment"". So instead @DATE1 buying newspapers or magazines most people go online to research current events. @PERSON1, @CAPS9 @DATE1 the @ORGANIZATION2. Says if we use comptuers instead @DATE1 newspapers @PERCENT6 @DATE1 the trees we cut down each year will be save. So obviously computers are environment friendly. Todays youth is messier than it ever was. @CAPS10 are having a hard time grading papers and tests because @DATE1 kids hand writting. So instead @DATE1 handwritting papers, kids make it easier on @CAPS10 by typing their work. Rescent studies show that @PERCENT7 @DATE1 @CAPS10 find it easier + better for kids to type papers. This shows kids are better off typing papers, and assignments. I hope you now understand my position on computers. The help us in many other ways too. In conclusion, they are not as time-consuming as every one @MONTH1 think. They also help us with research, are enviromental-friendly, and help the youth @DATE1 our world become neater one click at a time, making them a valuable tool in our modern world."
1524	1528	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 I think myself that the computers could help u. With a lot of thing like my teacher gave my class some homework and we had to find facts about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. And if it wasn't for the computer I wouldn't know nothing about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. Plus the computer could help u find long lost family remembers because when my grandfather die my mother finded her sister on the computer. Plus on the computer I could find out about others states that I dont know about and the computer could teach u about a lot of thing my mother and teacher can't teach @CAPS5. Nah @CAPS6 just saying computers could teach u abt of things that people don't know about, and that is why I believe they are so useful for learning and connecting with the world.
1525	1529	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I rencently started researching the effects that computers have on people an have found some shocking facts. I do not belive computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future. My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fine, and thosands of creatures. With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities. Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead you can just @CAPS2 or email them and @CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person! In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers! Thank you for your time and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter and will consider my viewpoint on this important matter.
1526	1530	1	3	Technology at @ORGANIZATION1 advances at a remarkable pace, and they consistently produce more new innovations. They had invented a computer which helps people in the work they have to do; however, there is a big problem, which is that people are spending too much time on the computer, especially teenagers. I suggest that this is a horrible idea because they are spending less time being active, also less time interacting with friends and family, and @CAPS1 it is dangerous for teenagers. However, many people @MONTH1 not agree with me. There are so many teenagers and adults that are just wasting time on the computer, instead of playing outside enjoying the nature, doing exercise and just having fun. Don't you think this is a great idea? Well, a friend of mine used to go outside every day to play, which I really miss. You know when you go to spend time with your family, but guess what, they are on the computer, wasting time instead of spending time with you. Do you think that's good? Well, it is not because that's how the family gathers and stops coming to visit you. That's just so sad, having family separate. That's not all, because do you think that people will be in dangerous problems? Well, they are. Do you know how you get a Myspace and you meet a boy that says he is the same age as you and asks if he could meet you, and you say yes? Let's say you were a @NUM1 year old girl, and he is like @NUM2 years old. He will abuse you or kill you. You thought he was @NUM1 years old but he was not. I think it is dangerous for kids. I think it is a horrible idea to have computers because you will spend less time in nature, also less time with your family, and you risk getting into dangerous things. However, people @MONTH1 not agree with me, but what if your child was in danger? How would you feel? People should really think about having computers and the potential consequences they bring into our lives and homes.
1527	1531	1	3	Who in the world would say a computer is useless? No one, computers are one of the most useful devices ever made. I think that computers are perfect and can help you build skills. I have @NUM1 reason: it builds skills, provides fast information, and is fun. Now let's get started with skill. Skills are things you need to have if you want to pursue a career. You can learn skills from books, TV, and computers. For example, I learned how to type rapidly on a keyboard from a computer game called Type to Learn. After a week of this game, I was typing like a pro. The computer also has chess to help build strategy. Just ask my super smart English teacher @PERSON1; she says that chess builds character and strengthens your mind. Moving along, I want to talk about how you can get information in an instant with computers. Experts say that it is the number one way to get information rapidly. I know I agreed with that after studying for a test on @LOCATION1 Carver in my book, but one of my pages was missing. So I used my computer; not only did I get my information quickly, I had gotten more information than the book contained. The next day I passed my test with a score of @NUM2 percent. You see how useful a computer can be. Finally, I want to talk to you about good old-fashioned fun. As you know, computers are perfect for building skills and getting information, but you can also always use a computer for fun. Do you know anyone in the world that can say the computer is not fun? No, you can't, because everyone in the world uses the computer for fun stuff like online games, videos, and talking to people. These are my reasons about computers building skill, having information, and providing fun, which make them an essential part of modern life.
1528	1532	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In many ways computers have been very useful to the human race. They can be used to look up information, talk to family and friends, listen to music, etc. Don't you think people are wasting more time on the computer instead of getting exercise? It's clear that computers can do just about anything you want them to do. But why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family, playing sports, or getting some fresh air? I think computers have a positive effect on people and a negative effect. One of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends. I know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school. In my opinion I think it is a great way so you can catch up on funny times that you and friends shared. Now here comes the negative effect. Many kids get bullied and picked on by other kids over the internet. This can cause other kids to have low self-esteem and cause dangerous events in the future. When it comes to computers, they have saved many people's lives. Some of these ways are finding cures to harmful diseases. Computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather. Wouldn't you agree that computers have played a huge role in our lives? Sometimes we should take a break from them and enjoy nature. So have fun with technology and don't forget to stay active too, finding a healthy balance between the digital world and the real one.
1529	1533	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered why people spend so much time on the computer? The effect of a computer on people is good and bad because the good parts are you can communicate with people in far away places, like you can talk to someone you went to @LOCATION1 with in @LOCATION1 and / or @CAPS1 @LOCATION1 with. The bad part is that if you're on the computer all the time then you are neglecting time with family and friends. When you are spending all of your time on the computer you are becoming a couch potato and it's very unhealthy. Also, a good reason is if a family member moved and you had to communicate by webcam; so if you live in @LOCATION2 and you have all your family here in @STATE1, you can connect better than by sending letters and pictures, but they can't see how you act, and by phone you can only hear voices, you can't see anything. A lot of people disagree because a lot of people think computers are a big waste of time, so that's all I have to say on the subject, hoping it provides some perspective on this modern dilemma.
1530	1534	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion about computers is that people should use them. Think about your children; when they grow up they will need to know how to use a computer for school, or even a job. It also teaches hand-eye coordination for multi-tasking. The computer is also fun and easy to use. I am almost positive that you love to use a computer; who doesn't? @CAPS2 first reason is that you will need to use a computer in everyday life. For example, if you are going to a job interview most @CAPS3 will ask how many words a minute can you type; you need to be proficient. Also at school, if you have a writing assignment due, then it would take more time writing it than typing it. All @CAPS3 will have to type one time or another. Especially your job as an @CAPS1; you need to use a computer every day. The computer also teaches hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is kinda like multi-tasking; you could type and talk on the phone or even exercising and texting. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill in life. All @CAPS3 will need to multi-task, like at a library you need to find a book and talk to people. Even driving a car you need to multi-task to stay on the road; you need to use one foot for brake and gas and you need to be looking at the road. You must multi-task along with hand-eye coordination. You're in luck; a computer teaches you. @CAPS2 last and final reason is it's fun and easy to use. I was @NUM1 when I started using a computer; I loved to play fun games. I never could type but I caught on because if you are having fun while you learn, it will be easy to turn. Just like math, it's not fun but you have to learn how to do it. So if you like having fun while learning something, the computer is for you. It's now or never for people to learn, get @CAPS3, and get good grades. It's fun and easy to learn how to use. It teaches you hand-eye coordination plus multi-tasking. You will absolutely need to know how to use a computer for @CAPS3 and school. We need computers for life; we always will need to use computers for every single day of our lives. Don't tell people it will rot your brain or you will become unhealthy from being on the computer; look past it. Don't you see all the good uses for computers? They are indispensable tools for our future success and daily functioning.
1531	1535	1	3	Here is my opinion. I think computers are useful and here are my reasons. One, kids can talk to their friends when they are punished. My second reason is people can go on the computer when they are bored. For example, when a kid beats all their games and they are bored they go search for new ones to buy. My final reason is when people want to look up something for something like their project but the library is closed they can just copy down the thing they need. My first reason is, kids can talk to their friends on the computer when they are grounded. For example, I was grounded last month for slapping my cousin in the face but I still got to talk to my friends. We are still talking but the only way to trick your parents is to tell them you are asking your friend about homework. My second reason is people can go on the computer when they are bored. For example, when a kid beats all his games and he is bored he can go search for new ones to buy or rent them or play downloadable games for the computer. My final reason is when someone wants to look up something for his or her project and the library is closed for information and copy it down for your project. My conclusion is we need computers to survive without them we will be in the stone age still, unable to connect or find information so easily.
1532	1536	1	3	"Some people don’t like computers because of instant messaging, and other people like computers a little too much. I like computers but I am not obsessed with them. Computers give good effects on people, even me. You can learn things off the computer and you start to get good hand-eye coordination. One of the things I like about them is that you can ""talk"" to other people. Lots of people use the computer a little too much that they don't exercise, or watch nature as much as some normal other people should, and they don't spend time with their families. I would rather spend time on the computer for only three hours so then I can do other things with my time, and you or anybody should do the same to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle."
1533	1537	1	3	My opinion on computers is that I think it's a good idea for people to go on computers. I think this way because if you haven't seen someone for so many years then you got a chance to see that person or talk to that person through the computer. Computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do. I like to go on the computer to talk to my friends that I haven't seen a while; you could also meet new people and make friends. If there wasn't computers then we would have to look through a lot of books for information, or go all the way to the bank to check your account balance; this is why I think computers are good ideas. On the computer you could see workouts to get fit; we don't only have to go to the gym. My dad goes on the computer to talk to his sisters, or play games with other people around the world. Another example I could use is my mom; she talks to her family in Jamaica and in other places too. If there wasn't computer's we couldn't do our tests, we couldn't get information. I think computers are very good ideas, cause it's good when you got to pay your bills too. We could interact with friends and family online too; that's what a lot of teens and adults do if there was a rainy day or if it's snowing and we don't get the chance to see our friends or relatives. For some people they think it's not a good idea because some people get addicted to the computers, but there is so much that you could do that the computer won't get you bored. That's why I think that computers are a good idea and that they are very important for communication, work, and daily life.
1534	1538	1	3	A lot of people use computers today. But not everybody thinks they benefit society. But computers can do anything! You can do research, you can play games, and most of all, be free. Were you ever given a school project to do, but no book has the information you want? Well the internet does. A lot of computers are connected to the internet where you can find anything! Are you trying to find facts for your science project? Just go on your favorite search engine and search your topic. You'll find endless pages on anything. Even if you're not doing school work, you can find anything on the internet. Did you forget the number of your favorite football player? Search his name and it'll tell you right on your screen. Are you wondering why the Yankees won the World Series? Your choices are endless! Even if your computer doesn't have internet, you can play games. Playing games on your computer is a great hobby! And if you are connected to the internet, you can play games with other people around the world. Playing games on your computer is a great hobby, but you can't play all the time; you need to find other things to do too. There are a variety of computer games. Adventure games, shooting games, multiple player games, and more! You can even play poker on your computer. I think the best part of any computer is your freeness while on one. You can do almost anything. You can go on the internet, play games, and even talk with people. You can also customize your computer to your liking. Do you have a picture of your cat? You can put it as your background on the desktop. Want a different cursor? You can change that too! You can change anything you want with just a click on your mouse. There you go, there are endless possibilities with computers. You can learn, play, and be free. But the most important part of using a computer is to enjoy it, and have fun while exploring its many features.
1535	1539	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, from personal experience, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Many people enjoy their time on the computer because, with today's technology, so many things can be done and quicker too. A large percentage of households have a computer at home. I do and it's just great. I get most things done and in a matter of time. I think computers have a positive effect on people because today you can do almost anything. For example, I have family in Canada; England, Jamaica, and Florida, and instead of calling them on the phone, I could video chat with them and it feels like you're actually there. Also, now you can pay your bills online, and instead of sending a letter through mail and waiting when it will arrive and having to buy stamps that are extremely expensive, you could just simply send an e-mail, free of charge. Most college students do their homework on the computer. They type essays, or while doing research on someone or something, they could just save it and take notes on it later. So basically a computer is almost a part of everyone's life and it can be entertaining, fun, and used for more important things. What I'm trying to say is computers are a part of every teenager's routine during the day. We like to interact with our friends and listen to music and bond with family and other relatives who you don't usually contact all on one piece of technology. Some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something. Computers are important; a computer will scan this test of mine and give me a score, so I think now you will agree with me when I say computers have had and always will have a positive effect on people. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my opinion and I hope you agree with my points.
1536	1540	1	3	@DATE1 @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a huge affect on people. My primary concern is that the computer gets kids lazy and unactive. Having a computer readily available will give kids the immediate action to sit around and do nothing, neglecting physical activity. I'm sure you've heard of popular websites such as myspace, facebook, formsping, etc. These social networking websites can get a person to be willing to be on the computer for hours instead of exercising and staying healthy. I believe kids like me these day want to keep in touch with their friends constantly. If the phone's not in the picture then the computer is the main alternative. Also, from my perspective, getting rid of the computer can stop the homosexuals from getting a hold of kids by acting their age online. I will admit the computer can be useful for schoolwork, but to be on all day that's just rediculous. I have a @NUM1 year old brother that stays on the computer from the time he gets home from school til the time he goes to sleep. Compared to me he's not fit and healthy at all, and I believe that's what countless hours on the computer did to him. In fact he's on myspace so much that he has over @NUM2 friends and he doesn't even know half of them personally; he gives them his number and home address without thinking. Do you notice a lot of kids these days want to play outside? You can see it when you would rather waste time on the computer other than going outside and at least enjoying your self. I've always had a passion for football but I could @CAPS2 find the time to play with my brother because he is always online. All he seems to be about is chicks and of course the computer. I'm not asking to take away computer's in people's homes completely but to put a stop to the daily number of hours spent on it because time is one thing that money can @CAPS2 buy back. Some kids will look back to these days wondering how much precious time they wasted on nothing. So long story short, like life itself, dont spend it all on nothing.
1537	1541	1	3	Dear NewsPaper, people are spending too much time on computers these days. You could be outside enjoying nature, playing sports, or traveling to new places. Some people argue that you can learn about animals and plants on a computer through videos, but there is nothing like really being outside with them in their natural environment. People who hike regularly and really enjoy being outside are reportedly @PERCENT1 smarter than people who don't venture out. I personally like being outside more than inside and I have straight A's in school, which shows it can be done. Sports are also a good way to get outside and be active. My favorite sport is baseball and I am pretty good at it. Some technology places say that computers can help with your hand-eye-coordination through games, but how can a computer truly help you with that in the real world? Sports are what genuinely help you with hand-eye coordination. Playing sports can also help you get physically stronger. Baseball is the reason why I can bench press @NUM1 pounds today. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of kids who play a sport are not over weight, but @PERCENT3 of kids who don't play sports are. Traveling is also a good way to get outside and explore. I love traveling to different countries. I am fluent in english french, and spanish because of it. My favorite place to go is northern @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1 for its beautiful landscapes. Computers can show you pictures of a place, but when you are actually there, it is really fascinating and immersive. A picture on a computer screen cannot even compare to what it is really like to stand there. You also cannot walk on a computer trail, or drink the fresh water from a stream, or climb up a clift. There is really no comparison between the two. Computers are alot worse for experiencing real nature. Compared to real life and nature, there really is no comparison at all. Computers simply aren't as good as real life. You can enjoy nature, playsports, an travel the world, all by just being outside and living life. Thank you for your time and consideration.
1538	1542	1	3	Do you remember school projects where you were sitting down bored and watching your @CAPS1 stations or sitting in the doctors office waiting bored out of your mind? Well no more! Since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those boring things are gone. There was once a time when the only way to do a project on a country was to look in the paper untill you found something, now with computer advancements you can enter a country's came into google, a major search site, and up comes @NUM1 different things on that country instantly. In fact @PERSON1, a leading expert on computers and inventor of one of the most advanced computers on earth, says that searching for information is now @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 eisier depending on the topic you are researching. Also you no longer have to work on a redundunt type write that always makes mistakes that you have to retype constantly. You can just use @ORGANIZATION1 and you type your essay directly. Anything speelled wrong is underlined in red so you only rarely have a spelling mistake in your final draft. As a result of this increase in knolage accessibility, from a learning stand point computers are extremly good for mankind. My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are highly entertaining. On your new laptop you can go on miniclip or addicting games, both popular gaming websites, and play hundreds of games. These game while not only are fun also improve handeye coordination which helps with sports, driving, writirs and many other real-world things. More advanced gaming computers called consoles such as the @CAPS2-box @NUM2, by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4 provide an exteme gaming experience. One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game has an advanced online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world. Not only that but advanced games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 can actually improve eyesight. Studies show that playing a high action game for @NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @NUM6 serving carrots a day. My final reason that computers are good for you is that they eliminate boring waits. If you've everyone to @CAPS10 you know that the lime can be @NUM4 hrs long. People used to wait that entire time just standing there. Now people can pull out their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player and listen to music to pass the time. The @CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as well as play music, videos and games all in one device. If you are lucky enough to have an I touch you can check email, stocks, weather and news right on your @CAPS13 as well as buy songs which can be @NUM9 cheaper than buying @CAPS14. In conclusion all of this advantage in technology benifits us greatly. We can now learn about new exiting things, have fun while improving eyesight, and we don't have to wait bored anymore.
1539	1543	1	3	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, i think some peoples are not spending to much time on the computers for bad reasons. Some peoples might be talking to their family members who live far away. To see if they are ok or if they are feeling bad so they can know and offer support. How about if someone die in they family and they don't know notthing about that peoples? It might ben their parents, grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles or it might ben one of their best friends from childhood. Some people also might be on their bank acount online. To see if they can get out money fror the bank for bills. Might also be sending money by going to the computer and be sending it to their family members in another country. They might be paying a bill by the computer, like the money they own to that bank or they might be doing some thing eles important. I also think many people are useing the computer to much for leisure. Just like kids, they go on the computer to just play games all day. That's not go for the little kid because if they keep going on the computers constantly, they might not want to get away from the computer screen. Then parents will have so hard time calling their kids to go eat dinner or to go to sleep at night. That's going to be a hard work to do for any parent. So i think some people should go outside to do exercis and enjoy the nature more often. I do beleve its better for people will go outside and do exercis, enjoy the nature, and spenting more time with their family in person. And thank you local newspapers for letting me share this. Some people are also now things about people are about some eles, which is a separate matter.
1540	1544	1	3	I believe people spend too much time on the computer. A lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day, from morning until night. They should be spending that valuable time with family and friends in person. People never seem to have enough time for outdoor activities anymore. Also, computer use should mostly be reserved for talking with family and friends online, doing homework, research, playing games when @CAPS1 bored, and work-related tasks. To begin with, people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than being isolated on the computer. For example, @CAPS1 your mother or father asked you if @CAPS1 you wanted to go out to dinner and you said no, I'm on the computer, that would just mean your obsessed with going on the computer. A lot of families are bing broken apart because people spend too much time on the computer and not with each other. @CAPS1 you have a friend over and they say I am bored and all you are doing is play games on the computer than that is just being rude because your friend is bored and wants your attention. So you need to get off the computer and spend quality time with your loved ones. Previously I stated how people should spend time with loved ones, well people also need to spend more time doing physical activities as well. A lot of humans sit on the computer and eat snacks, so over the time they eventually get fat and unhealthy. @CAPS1 you are gaining weight because your on the computer all day than you need to go do some activite to burn off that fat. @CAPS1 you are a teen and you are given the idea to play a sport and you refuse it because computer is more important then that is some serious obesession with the computer. As a result, the computer should be used wisely and in moderation. The computer should be used to talk to family and friends, for homework, for research, for work, and @CAPS1 you are bored you can play some little games on the computer for a short time. Those are probably the most important things that should most likely used for the computer. A lot of these things that I have listed are important because @CAPS1 you go on the computer just to be on and watch people talk then what's the point of wasting your time on the computer when you could be doing much more different and productive things on the computer or offline. For example, @CAPS1 you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions you can go to www.dictionary.com to find them quickly, or @CAPS1 you just need to define a simple word for a assignment. In conclusion, people spend too much time on the computer for non-essential reasons. They need to be spending more time with family and friends in the real world. Also people need to be doing more activities in their lives to stay healthy. Lastly, you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research. So, as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things in life.
1541	1545	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am aware that many people are stating that people spend too much time on computers and not getting enough exercise. Well, I have that there are a lot of people using computers and they are getting enough use. I'm going to explain why within the next few paragraphs. First I would like to start off by saying it's good that people are into computers and working with them because that boosts their learning activities and they learn new things and it will help them be successful in life. For instance, people play games, do crossword puzzles, solve riddles, and many more activities that stimulate the mind. Some use the internet for finding ingredients for a recipe, searching for car parts, and other practical needs. Next, using computers is very helpful to the human race because it will affect students' schoolwork, parents, guardians, and teens. It will affect and lots of schools are using computers now and especially students use them to do their assignments. It effects parents, because it will bring them success in life and help them find jobs, and assist them with their daily work tasks. Finally, they're getting enough exercise because they're going to bed, they're eating, they go to school, go to work, or do something for the day that involves walking. Nobody just sits home and does nothing these days. There's always something to do or a place to go that requires physical movement. Well I hope you think about what I told you and take it into consideration. Thank you for your time, and just remember your job is done on a computer too.
1542	1546	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, People use computers all over the world, for one reason or another, but they are very necessary in our world. That is why computers have a good effect on people today. They help us contact distant family members. Kids rely on them for studying or homework. Adults need them for their jobs, like sending emails or typing a proposal. That's why computers have a good effect on us. Like me, many kids have family across the ocean or just across the country, either way, contacting them is tough. Calling them @MONTH1 be expensive in most cases and sending letters certainly takes too much time to reach them. With email, the message will be sent quickly and free. You can also have conversations through email with no problem. Another very effective way to contact family is through Skype or a web cam. This way you can see your family from miles away in the comfort of your own home. Computers help kids too. Kids like me always have homework on the computer. It could be typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure, either way they both require a computer. Sure, there are books to take notes on people, but do books type up papers? Kids and teenagers can also use them for studying. I constantly use the computer to practice Spanish by using a website with worksheets and flash cards to help me. Computers not only help kids, they help adults too. Many adults in @LOCATION1 and other countries are business men and women. They are constantly sending emails, typing proposals and all those things. And without a computer all that would be very challenging. Business men are not the only ones doing that though. My father, an electrician, has to send out emails and documents about his latest project several times a week. Aside from work, we use them in our everyday lives. For example, ordering clothes and toys, but most popular is doing your taxes online. It is quicker and easier and that is why @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 finish their taxes online. Computers have a good effect for people of this age. Not only is that my opinion, it is also more of a fact. They help us stay connected with distant relatives, help our children stay on top in school and help our parents and other adults in their jobs and in everyday lives. Not only are they helpful, but they are necessary and I hope you agree with me.
1543	1547	1	3	Dear local Newspaper? Today I am writing this letter to you on computers. I believe that the people who don't have computer's have the right to say that people are online rather than exercising. My three topics are they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn, and allow the people to communicate. First, the computers aren't just for talking about! It gives them to learn hand-eye coordination. If people were to believe that computers are just for fun, they would be wrong. They would teach you how to type and take some lesson on typing without looking on the keyboard. Secondly, it gives the people the ability to learn about other cultures or where a place is. @PERCENT1 out of the American population are online learning, and the @PERCENT2 are online for their job to be online. What about little kids? Where are they? I'm sure they're buying them educational games for online. Finally, it gives the ability to communicate with other people. If there's a school closing or a delay you don't know about, you would like to get a notification. It gives people the ability to check-out on what's going on around the world or checking for the weather. These are my reasons why I truly believe that people should be online at least twice a week to gain these benefits.
1544	1548	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 don't have a bad affect on people because you can play games, webchat, and watch hilarious videos on the computers. Also, you can use the computers for a research project or you can use the @CAPS2 for some facts on @CAPS3 people like @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Also, who would want to get off their @CAPS2 and exercise, exercising is so boring and lame. Second, who would like to especially enjoy the nature, walking through the woods is so boring, you'll be walking through mud, ticks will be all over your body, mosquitoes will try and bite you when you sweat. When kids get older, they mostly don't want to interact or spend time with their family, they want to spend time with their friends everyday. Also, they mostly want to use technology too. Kids will spend time texting on their cellphones when they're not in the mood for calling. Thirdly, computers do give you hand-eye coordination; it teaches you how to type without looking down at the keyboard. Computers also teach you how to set your fingers on the home row for the keyboard. Finally, @CAPS2 really do benefit society because you can use this technology in middle school, high school, and through college. When you get older you'll be learning more about these kinds of technology. Also, kids could teach their parents how to use computers if their parents don't know how to. Teaching your parents how to use @CAPS2 is a great responsibility for your actions and a valuable skill to share.
1545	1549	1	3	To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @ORGANIZATION1, almost everyone has them. Computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2; they are also a way of communication. I believe people using computers does benefit society because scientists use computers every day, to make the plans to send a ship into space or to keep progress of an experiment. Computers help people stay organized with calendars and task lists. A lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop online and stay in touch with friends through social media. Some people believe people spend too much time on computers. That @MONTH1 be true, but also remember what its doing for society. When people spend less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice. Its not like they're being obliged by the @ORGANIZATION1 to use technology over other activities; it is a matter of personal preference and modern necessity.
1546	1550	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Many people use computers but not every one agrees that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are numerous websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is that many companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report or project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to communicate easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the side of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They also use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. You can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the many reasons why computers are good for society.
1547	1551	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I understand that computers are becoming more of a ""must have"" in peoples everyday life. I believe this is a great thing! If you're on the computer you type which helps improve peoples hand-eye coordination. Also, you can learn more about people, places, cultures and much more. Lastly, you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people. To begin, I think having computers is a good idea because it helps people improve on their hand-eye coordination. My cousin @PERSON3, who is a big time baseball player, used to have trouble catching the ball when he was younger. He kept trying over and over again and never gave up. Then, for his birthday his parents bought him a computer! He was so excited, but when it came to typing papers, he wasn't the best. Not only did he practice baseball but also typing. His family realized that buying him that computer was one of the best ideas. It improved his baseball career by throwing and catching the ball and increased his grades in school. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one that has gained hand eye coordination from computers. A recent study from yale college shows that @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer for at least a month gains some sort of hand eye coordination. @PERSON1, a teacher of the computer class at high school states, ""@CAPS1 freshman that I get in my class tells me that computers have made their sports careers easier because they now have better hand eye coordination."" Computers have two things in one, you learn to type and help your hand eye coordination. Do you want your @CAPS3 to be lacking that positive ability in life? In addition, computers help you learn more about people, places and cultures. I heard a couple nights ago that @ORGANIZATION2 had an earthquake. I also learned about the powerplant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. How do I know all of this you ask? The front page on @CAPS2.com! But, i'm not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet, so many more have too. @ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @CAPS3 use the computer to do research and @PERCENT2 answered that they did. Does the society really want to take away @CAPS3 knowledge of whats going on around us and our history? In conclusion, people can communicate with friends and relatives. This is great if you haven't seen them recently, or if you want to just stay in touch. For example, @PERSON4, my cousin, just found me on facebook. I haven't seen her for eight years but now I talk to her all the time. We talk about visiting each other and how our family's are doing. But, you can also talk to your friends too. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 between the ages of eleven and eighteen talk to their friends over facebook on a daily basis. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, says ""I think this is a great idea for @CAPS3 to communicate with other @CAPS3 through the computer. It gives them the chance to interact in a different way."" @CAPS3 have such a good lifestyle for them, do you want to feel guilty for ruining that? Finally, people have perfect opportunities right in front of them. Computers help improve hand eye coordination and helps you learn. It also lets people interact with others in a different way. Do you think that these golden ideas are bad for our society?"
1548	1552	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I agree with experts that said that computer should be used because I said that people does need computers because they are important. The computers search fast and people communicate from the computer. People have computer at their houses because we and they need. We need sometime you take minutes a word but is you look up at the computer you will see at a second and thus way we should stay with computer and more @CAPS1 need computer thus very important for @CAPS1 because some time they do not understand something and they looked up in the computer like stolen is we have a homework and we have to know about a important person we have to learned up at the computer those easy. Some people do not have a computer home. But they go to the library and for the thing they have to go away. We have to think spend time with a family. But we have to computer become we have to because we need. Some people games and play. But for important about a home work and some people at theirs jobs need computer and most of the need compute like one i wants to be a police officer and the police officer. They have a little computer at there car to search store and that is important for the police. I know thus most of family wants to be together spend time with the family but we have to about us future to we need computer that help us and we need the computer for the future. And that is my opinion for that a help that you agree with my words.
1549	1553	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirdly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!"
1550	1554	1	3	Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another question for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they aren't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly they allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was saying before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you aren't very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the water falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that maybe some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1 or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excellent source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to travel. The computer is also excellent for elderly people who are in wheel chairs and can't take too much movement. Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then maybe a father went on a business trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to.
1551	1555	1	3	Computers can be used for anything, but sometimes people use them for illegal things like downloading music from illegal music sites, and sometimes things off the internet can be unauthorized or harmful. People who meet over the internet can sometimes be dangerous because some people lie about their age or put fake pictures of themselves online to deceive others. This creates risks for unsuspecting individuals who may form relationships based on false information, leading to potential harm or disappointment. It is important to be cautious and verify information when interacting with strangers online to ensure personal safety and security in the digital world.
1552	1556	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers play a huge role in society. Many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and I think that is bad. Instead of being on computers, I think it would be best to spend time with your family, sharing meals and conversations. Exercising and enjoying the outdoors is also a good time consuming activity to do, promoting physical health and well-being. Studying, school work, and jobs are also important things people should be doing instead of being on the computer so much, as these activities build a foundation for a successful future. Family is very important in life and some people take advantage of it. Instead of being on the computer all day, spending time at home with family and doing activities with them could be more fun and rewarding. For example, most teenagers come home from school and go on the computer to talk to friends or play games instead of talking with their parents about their day or anything else. By spending time with family you not only learn more about them but you can become closer and be able to talk with them about anything, strengthening your bonds. Nature is a beautiful thing. Sure you can see pictures of nature on the internet, but it is not the same as the actual thing. By going outside, and enjoying nature, taking walks, runs, or even hikes, you can get your exercise and fresh air. Exercising is a very important thing in a persons life, because you need to be fit to be healthy, and by being on a computer all day that would not happen. Adults, and even some teenagers have jobs to attend to. While some jobs involve computers, most do not require constant screen time. No one can get a job by spending all day on the computer playing games or just talking to people. Teenagers need to focus on their studies and responsibilities while balancing their leisure time. Computers are used all the time, but they are not the only important thing. There are plenty of important activities, such as, spending time with family, enjoying nature, and focusing on school work and jobs. Computers are not a complete necessity for every aspect of our lives, so I think we should be mindful about using them and prioritize real-world interactions and commitments for a more balanced and fulfilling existence.
1553	1557	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 sees tired, lazy people sitting on their computer and wasting their life because of it. The issue to discuss is whether you think that people are spending too much time on the computer or not. I strongly believe that people are spending too much time on the computer. And, here are @CAPS2 reasons why: people are spending less time exercising, people are not enjoying nature, and they are spending less time interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt you probably know that exercising is at least somewhat helpful to life, @CAPS4 if people are sitting home @NUM1 on the computer with no exercise, it is going to cause people to gain an excess amount of weight. Because the more they just sit around and do nothing except use the computer, the more unhealthy they're going to be and the more lazy they're going to be. So they're not going to want to do anything and really it's just a waste of life. And, in some cases it can cause depression and severe mental health issues. Just ask a local resident who says "" @CAPS2 mom used to be on the computer all the time and did nothing with her life,"" and @CAPS3 she became deeply depressed. And, soon after, she tragically killed herself."" @CAPS3 fears more and more people are going to become like her if this continues. I know that a lot of people like to be outside when its a nice sunny day. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 finds somebody on that day stuck in a room, with their eyes glued to the computer screen. Because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives, they remain isolated indoors. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 believes if that was someone you loved, doing that with their life, you would be concerned. I'm pretty sure you would try to do something to help them get off that destructive path. Just ask another local resident @PERSON1 who says, ""I remember coming home everyday, and there was @CAPS2 mom, no shades up, the room was pitch black, it was like a dark cave, and she would sit there for hours on the computer wasting her life, and I remember asking her how long has it been since you've gone outside, she answered, its been almost two months."" @CAPS4 also knows from @CAPS2 family that there was a family member of theirs who was a ""computer junkie"". And, I remember at a family get together @CAPS2 aunt was the only one who could never come. Because she was too busy on the computer, missing out on precious family moments and connections that are vital for a supportive and happy life, ultimately leading to regret and loneliness."
1554	1558	1	3	@PERCENT1 of all people in the @LOCATION3 have computers. This significant number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer. It helps us communicate better, get information quicker, and entertain us in various ways. Computers have a very positive effect on us and our daily routines. With the invention of the computer, more and more people can communicate quicker and easier than ever before. For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them instantly. Also, @CAPS1 if you have relatives who live across the country, you could use a webcam to talk with them and see their faces. When you can talk to people from around the world, you can learn a lot more about other countries' cultures and other cities' way of life, broadening your horizons. Finally, @CAPS1 if a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, and the relationship just gets better and stronger over distance. The internet and computers are a wealth of information readily available. With all of the search engines on the internet you can find out how tall a maple tree is or, how to lose weight effectively. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities, nature walks, and new and exciting exercises to combine learning with activity. When students need information on a school project, they can go online and search for it instead of going over to the library, saving time and effort. As a result of the internet, people are smarter and more informed about the world. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom in our daily lives. Kids and adults alike are not bored with this technology at their fingertips. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it, sometimes leading to trouble. When the computer came, people could play games, watch @CAPS2.V. and movies, and do business efficiently from home. @CAPS1 if you missed your favorite @CAPS2.V. show you can go online and watch them at your convenience. @CAPS1 if you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, e-mail comes into place, and your mail will never be slow or get lost. And finally, you can play many, many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination and mental sharpness. With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. There is information quicker, communication better, and entertainment better, making our lives more connected and enjoyable than ever before, which ultimately creates a more informed and harmonious society for everyone.
1555	1559	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 I'm @PERSON1, @CAPS2 going to tell you some positives & negatives about the truth concerning computers. First @CAPS2 going to tell you some positives about computers. The internet is a virtual library at your finger tips, it provides the smartest answers to the most challenging questions from curious individuals. On the internet every thing is more easy, I mean all you have to do to learn how it works is to use a keyboard & mouse, which are simple tools. Computers have changed significantly over the years, from large machines to compact devices we have today. Yes computers have evolved and there are popular chatting websites like @CAPS3, facebook, twitter, flickr that connect millions. It seems cool yes but the internet has a very dark side too that cannot be ignored! Second, here are some dark secrets of the computer that people should know. So far in the news there have been reports of suicide among teenagers, reports like: girls killing themselves because of a lack of online acceptance or due to cyberbullying. Boys killing themselves because of similar pressures and harassment found on the internet. Yes we do live in a world where everyone is judged by how they appear or act online, which can be harsh and unforgiving. Well there you have it, computers are good & bad, we just have to be careful and use them responsibly to maximize the benefits while minimizing the potential harms and dangers they can present to vulnerable individuals.
1556	1560	1	3	"Dear newspaper, do you want people to be so mesmerized by a computer that they miss out on the world around them? Do you want the kids in our community to spend hours each day on the computers playing games while they could be outside getting fresh air? The question then is, do computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is a bad effect. People constantly using the computers learn them bad habits and can search inappropriate things. If people are always playing games on the computers then when do they go out for a jog? The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in our town are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, and you know you've wasted the whole day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really addictive and you don't want to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get some air. As you can see, computers can mesmerize a lot of people so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on to develop bad habits. For example, kids are always using shorthand when they type. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people don't use proper grammar too much and get too used to writing like that. Then, kids in school start doing that on writing assignments and most don't even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to learn your details. Lastly, it is very easy for people, even children, to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words and pictures and no one would ever know. People can post inappropriate information on their own pages for others to see that can be impossible to take down. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to get no exercise and to access inappropriate things. So go and limit the time you spend on the computer."
1557	1561	1	3	Dear Local Editor, how do you feel about computers? Are they good or are they bad? I strongly believe that computers are bad and people spend too much time on them. I'd much rather spend time outside where I can exercise; wouldn't you? Computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending time together. Finally, computers can be very dangerous. People could be lying and you wouldn't know it. To start off, computers take away from exercising and spending time outside. I know if I had to choose between looking at a boring computer screen all day and going out for a run; I'd choose the run any day. Computers don't keep people fit and healthy so they should find something else to do instead. I've observed that the average teen spends two to four hours a day on the computer. That's two to four hours they could be exercising or playing outside. For example, walking the dog, or kicking the soccer ball around. You see, there are many things you can do other than going on the computer. Furthermore, computers cut into quality time with friends and family. I know you can video chat and instant message them, but wouldn't you rather spend time with them in person? Too many kids are on the computer so much they don't know what's going on in their mom or dad's lives. There are a lot of things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer. They could play a board game, watch a movie, and much more. I guarantee they will enjoy these activities more than staring at a computer screen for several hours. Finally, computers are extremely dangerous. People have been killed because they don't know who they are talking to. Kids go on social media and put up pictures and posts, but they don't realize that everyone can see what they said. Once they put something out there they cannot take it away. It's also dangerous because if someone is applying to a school that school can see what they put up and can decline the person from college. I hope you agree with me when I say computers are bad. They keep people from exercising, spending time with friends and family, and are very dangerous. In my opinion we should get rid of computers in every house.
1558	1562	1	3	The importance of computers in the modern world. Computers nowadays are popular technology; nowadays computers are like a bigger calculator. The invention of the computers started from a very short calculator. It's like a mother being in your house. A lot of people have different kinds of computers that are more improved, more faster and more high quality. The computers nowadays are improving their technology, every day there are billions buying computers across the whole world but that does not mean that they are the best quality, but the people are fighting for better modern inventions. This shows that computers are a significant part of our daily lives and their development continues to be a major focus around the globe.
1559	1563	1	3	Computers, one of the daily things we use and play with. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers! I love computers but, I as a teen know about managing your time on the computer. You cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer. The amount of time wasted on your computer could be the time you might be outside having fun. There's lots of things you could do outside! As for some examples: play ball, run around, go to the park, go exploring etc... Friends and family are very entertaining, I have lots of friends and I love them all! If you have some spare time you should hang out with them and have some fun, go to the mall! I always go to the mall with my friends instead of playing on the computer for hours on end. So get off the computer and go play! Have some fun in the sun today and enjoy the world beyond the screen.
1560	1564	1	3	I disagree with what people say about computers. Likewise of course they teach hand eye coordination. But they are not good enough for people. Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wonder why. Because they spend too much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways a large percentage of the country is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about a million dollars a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you experience it? Well I think so because people don't think before chopping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torture every year. Computers are such a bad influence to people again because people need to experience life and not sit behind a desk or at home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy sites on the web are not good. There are sexual predators all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us. You should not interact with strangers on the internet for that reason. You should get some exercise at the park with your friends and family. Also its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to know them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or you might get yourself killed. It makes you so fat that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people and consider a life with less screen time.
1561	1565	1	3	Dear local newspaper people, computers have helped us with our planet in significant ways. For instance, they reduce the need for us to drive our cars for various errands. Learning has become easier for everyone with computers too, as they provide quick access to information. They also facilitate communication with people far away. We should not resent a box that contains information; we should be glad we have something like that in our home. Often, we don't need to use our cars if you have a computer. Some people have decided they can start their own business, so they use the computer to establish one. Then, if you don't want to waste time driving to buy a t-shirt, you can just go on the computer and buy one online. Furthermore, the more we drive, the more pollution gets into our atmosphere. If we did not have computers, our planet would get significantly more polluted each year. Now, do you want that to happen to the world? Additionally, we wouldn't be wasting gas in our cars because we are using computers for these tasks. If the computer was taken away, people would still choose the lazy way and just drive cars. Learning is easier for everyone with computers; for example, we don't have to look in a book to find something. There are also different learning programs to teach us a different language, which is helpful for many people. For those who did not go to college, there are online learning opportunities. Lastly, it can help us do our homework if we have some. I really consider it my second brain for the assistance it provides. Communication is also greatly enhanced with computers. Say you don't have a phone and you need to send a lot of messages; the computer can help you. It will allow you to talk to other people, like someone from Japan who knows English, so you can learn how their life compares to yours. You can ask people questions, or just for fun, you can play mind games with other people online. I got to do a lot of chatting with my old friend this way, and I miss them, but this is the only way I can talk to them without my parents yelling at me because the phone bill is so high. The greater good of a computer makes us realize we don't have to do so many things that are harmful, like pollute our air. Then we can learn quickly without a book. Finally, it allows us to talk to my old friends, so everyone should believe me that the computer is not that bad for our society and our world.
1562	1566	1	3	Hello, my name is @PERSON1 and I am going to convince you that computers can benefit our society. First, computers allow students to easily get good grades on projects and reports. Second, you can make online job applications efficiently. Lastly, computers allow people to chat with other people from anywhere. Firstly, the computer allows your children, who are students, to do better on their projects and reports. They help children's reports because, for example, if they are doing a report on Abraham Lincoln, they have access to look up the person to get the information they need right at home. Doing reports with their computer means there is no need to use up your physical resources; you can also look up information and print out pictures to make your project more vibrant and eye-catching to younger audiences. Also, computers allow you to type your information to make the final product look organized and neat. Accordingly, if you are trying to find job applications without wasting your time, you can just look on the internet. This way you won't go to a place not knowing if jobs are available and finding none. Also, computers save you the trip out there. You are able to look up the pay of the job and its regulations, and you can find out if you get the job faster. Lastly, computers allow for easy socializing. For example, platforms like Facebook or Myspace let you talk to friends from school or friends you met online. For adults who don't have a Myspace or Facebook account, they can use email, MSN, AOL, AIM/AOL Instant Messenger, or other chat services. This way adults can catch up on work communications and children can keep in touch with friends or family members. This is why I think computers with internet benefit our society through improved projects, reports, job applications, and socializing with family and friends.
1563	1567	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, everywhere you look today technology is being exercised, and it is beneficial to many aspects in our lives. Many engineers strive to improve the popularity of technologic devices, while others use them to communicate or relax. According to a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 university, the computer is the most largely operated machine. The computer positively contributes to our education, economy, and entertainment. As I mentioned before, the computer is beneficial to our education. An example of this is the school I attend, a middle school. Here we have over @NUM1 computers in use throughout the school day. These computers help the students complete research papers, typed assignments, and other teacher-required papers. By using the computer to complete research papers, students save hours of scanning through books in the library and money on purchasing reading books. In addition, computers help teachers in organizing files and entering grades online so students can check their performance. This is beneficial considering the amount of homework and assignments graded each week. Moreover, a computer system called the ""parent portal"" allows parents and students to stay connected with school events that would not be mentioned otherwise. In all, computers are a fundamental way of enhancing education. Besides education, computers touch upon our economy as well. Now, due to the wide variety of computer selection, a computer is affordable, starting at prices as low as sixty dollars! This is a positive aspect of the computer because currently the country has been enduring economic challenges since the depression. Consequently, the economic situation has made families start to cut many useful technology devices out of their budgets. However, since the price of computers has decreased, purchases have stimulated the market. Also, the computer has mainly improved methods of entertainment. Instead of listening to a cd player, you can download music to listen to while chatting online with friends. This is very helpful for last-minute plan changes because, for those who do not own a telephone, communication would be difficult, negatively affecting your time of entertainment. In addition, children can use the internet to play games to take their mind off of a hard day at school, or an adult can relax after rough work. Computers are involved in producing the movies you watch at home on the couch and the videogame you ordered off of eBay. From Facebook and Myspace to classic films like ""Gone with the Wind,"" computers create a relaxing entertainment opportunity for everyone."
1564	1568	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are giving bad effects on people's lives. Instead of using your time wisely and getting active outdoors, you're inside your house on the computer playing games or chatting with your friends. If you're one of those people who easily gets overweight or is on any diabetic medication right now, I'd easily recommend you to do a workout or go and invite a friend over for a walk at the park. That way you are enjoying nature, talking with your buddy instead of doing it online, and you'd also be getting exercise. If you didn't notice, you are also doing your friend a favor too. Not only are you getting good benefits from the outdoors, but so is your partner. Getting more active can even bring your friendship or family bond even closer. You might also improve your self-esteem because you'll look in the mirror and feel great about your new, healthy-looking body. Also, if you're one of those people always depressed, feeling lonely, or just in a bad mood, this advice could be the key to your solution. The workouts and outdoor activities help you have more energy you never thought you'd have before. If I were you, I'd stop being lazy and actually enjoy your life and not waste time doing lazy activities indoors when you could be outside living fully.
1565	1569	1	3	The effects computers have on people are not reasonable for children and other individuals. Computers are not good for people these days because people are spending all their time on the computer and aren't realizing that it messes up their eyes, and some people are addicted to it. Now people are using the computer like it is nothing. So, while people think that computers aren't hurtful to their eyes, the time people are spending on the computer could be spent with their family and friends. People's health is on the line with this computer thing. People shouldn't be using computers the way they are because being on the computer all day can mess up your eyes, and that's what people are not understanding in their daily routine. I think that there should be a limit for when people go on the computers to protect their well-being and encourage more real-world interaction.
1566	1570	1	3	Yes, I believe that computers benefit society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn, and lastly, computers are a part of today's technology. First of all, computers have really progressed from the old typewriter we used to have. Computers have helped today's life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didn't know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likely you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where its located or anything else about it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say you're going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the address, the internet will give you directions. Even if you don't know when your favorite show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefit society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well, because one of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about Christmas I found her on Facebook and now we talk and catch up because we haven't seen each other in years, @CAPS2 alone to talk to her. Another reason why is that if someone's mom or dad is away at war or overseas then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, Skype, Yahoo instant messenger, with the webcam or the telephone just @CAPS2 alone just typing back and forth. You could also just use it for a job business to talk to your co-worker or one of your workers on webcam to see how things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technology has come a long way. For example, if you had to type something up you would have had to use a typewriter and those things are hard to use. Today you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font and much more. Another reason why is with iPhones or iTouches now you don't have to be at home you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to, to find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza, but technology has come a long way. So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didn't know before, and finally computers have changed a lot and they are a part of our technology.
1567	1571	1	3	In my own opinion I think that people should get less time on computers and more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. If people spend time on computers they will not get off and be stuck on computers instead of spending time like going to the park, or the mall. For my second opinion, that people should not get off of computers because if they ever leave somewhere far they are not able to contact you. If you are on the computer you could get a computer that says a free laptop then you could take it far like on an airplane to North Carolina, or Virginia, or Washington @ORGANIZATION1, or a party, or a road trip, or on a ferry boat to the Long Island Sound. For my third opinion, that I agree people should not be off of computer because they might plan a trip to a far away place or a new house, or planning an anniversary, or a new spot for a honeymoon, a gorgeous place like on a peak hill or at a hotel with a bed shaped like a heart. For my fourth paragraph, that I agree that people should not be off of computers that can count a location than a person's house or a location where they might be for that particular spot where that person is. For the fifth paragraph, that I agree that people should not be able to get off of computers. I tell you why, planning a birthday party for their child, or going to someone's house for a visit like to Tennessee. Or going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to see a basketball team and @CAPS1's another team and they are called @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Lakers vs Cavaliers. My conclusion is that people should not be able to get off of computer because it is essential for communication and planning in our modern lives.
1568	1572	1	3	Dear to @CAPS1 this @MONTH1 concern, Computers do a whole lot now of days. You can play games, do homework, socialize but don't you think there are better things than that. Such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly interacting with family and friends. These are all the things that computers take away from people. Once you get onto a computer you never want to get off. If you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. So if you eat and use the computer all day you're not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight. Computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising. That is not good for your health at all. Exercising gives you energy and is good for you. Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? When you're on the computer chit-chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what you're missing. Every time I use the computer I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature. Trees, flowers, plants, grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't appreciate those things. So next time you're on the computer think about that. While you're on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. Would you like to be that child who doesn't have a family or any type of friends? Lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen any day. So I believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends. Even if it's just having a conversation do it, maybe it can show them that you really care. In conclusion, I think that computers are a waste of time. I understand how people say it is used to communicate with people but back then they didn't have computers and they communicated so we can to. Computers make you spend less time exercising, keeps you from enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family and friends. You won't go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday and realizes the value of time spent away from it.
1569	1573	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 are you? As for me I am fine. I am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons why I am writing this letter is that people could contact with friends and families from far-away places, computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world and also computers helps people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. First of all why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could contact with friends and families from far-away places. An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families in different places. And they cannot have a good contact with them. But if they go on the internet they could find their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the @LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in @LOCATION1 you could have a connection. I have families that lives in @LOCATION1 and it is hard to reach them. But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet and research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advices. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new recipe and you are not sure on @CAPS3 to make it, the computer will give you the ingredients and direction to make that food or snack you want. That's why I believe that you and all others should believe that computers have a positive effects. In conclusion why you should believe that computers have a positive effect is that people could contact with friends and families, computers helps you learn about different parts of the world, and also computers helps you learn and understand more about life. I would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people. That's why you should believe that computers have positive effect on people and the way we live.
1570	1574	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I have recently learned that the paper has decided to write about computers and how they benefit society in @LOCATION1. I am writing this letter to say that I agree with how computers benefit society. @CAPS2 first reason is that computers help people educate others. They allow people to learn about hand-eye coordination. @CAPS2 final reason is computers allow you to talk online with your friends. There's a lot more in store so keep reading on. @CAPS2 first reason why computers are good for society is computers help people learn about things. To start things off computers are a great way to help out in school because it's a quicker way to get an education. For example a computer helps you study for a test with information websites like @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS2 second reason why computers provide a good education is computers help you do your homework. For example when there's a major essay due the next day, you can go on a computer and type it. It's quicker and a lot more productive. I remember this one time when I had to write a final draft for an important essay and it was @CAPS2 last day to do it. Since it was @CAPS2 last day to do it the first thing I did was go to the library and type it; what would have took me an hour to write took me half an hour to type. That all here I'm moving on. @CAPS2 next reason why computers help out in society is computers help learn about hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is something that most people have, but for those who don't the computers help out in many reasons. @CAPS2 first reason is computers help learn yoga. Yoga is something to help take away stress inside of you. Computers have online videos that help you use it if you don't have the time to actually go. @CAPS2 final reason is that computers help out with sports. Sports are something that everyone loves to participate in and something that everyone likes. Computers have videos that show you how to play sports and enjoy them as much as you do in real life. I'm going on now. @CAPS2 last reason why computers help out in society is you are able to talk with your friends online. @CAPS2 first reason why you can talk with your friends is a website called @CAPS2-@CAPS3. Myspace is a website that's all about talking with your friends. It has grown extremely popular in chatting. @CAPS2 final reason is online dating. If you want to start dating again you can always start online. It allows you to start a new life without leaving your room. I should probably start wrapping things up. Now that you have heard all of @CAPS2 reasons for why computers are helpful in society I should wrap things up. Having computers in life is one of the most useful things you can have. You can talk to your friends, learn hand-eye coordination and get an education. As you can see computers rule and are a fundamental part of our modern world. There's so many more reasons but this is just one man's opinion who knows what other people think about them.
1571	1575	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people. Since I have two computers and one laptop I have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer. Everyone should have computers, because you can look up different things, you can play games like checkers with the computer or against somebody else, and the last reason is that you can chat with people from different states and even countries, because I know everybody likes to talk to one another. Everyone should have computers, because you can search different things. You can search places and people. Basically, you can search anything on the internet if you are on the right website. One time I wanted to go on the web and look to see if there was a museum in my city. I went to ask.com and typed in ""Is there a museum in my city?"" It said yes, and then it showed me a list of information about it. It told me the address the phone number and the name of the manager. Looking up places is helpful sometimes. Everyone should have a computer because you can play any types of game. You could play internet game checkers, solitaire and even freecell. If you don't have any types of games you can always go on gaming websites to find games up there. Since I use the computer everyday I know all about it. When I was six years old we found a driving game. Since I did not know the website all I got to play was checkers on the computers but one day I logged onto it and played my first driving computer game. Everyone should have a computer, because you can chat with people. Instead of always using your phone calling and texting people raising your phone bill, why not use your computer and chat all you want without wasting minutes on your cell phone. I know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone. Instead of doing that just go on the internet find a chat site and start chatting or blogging with your friends. One time I ran out of minutes on my phone and I didn't have internet. I asked my dad if I could use the computer. He said yeah, so I went to a local chatroom on the internet. My friend had an account there so it would be easy for us to talk all we wanted. I joined in and we chatted until midnight. In conclusion I think everyone that likes to look up places, play games, and chat should have a computer."
1572	1576	1	3	Computers are interesting pieces of technology to work with at home or at work. Some people might think that computers are a waste of time. Also might not be useful. Or that the computers don’t have any way of helping you. Other people think that the computer is very helpful. People should be happy about the computer invention. What do you think about it? Your wasting your time on the computers! That's what you hear your parents say all the time right. Well, kids don't really waste their time if they are on the computer because they could be writing up a paper for a class. They might be playing an educational game on the computers. Even if they aren't playing a game or writing up a paper, it is still making them learn something. Some people might say that computers are useless, but that is not true. When you are writing a paper for an English class, you would want a computer to help. It has a keyboard so it goes faster when you type instead of writing the word out. It also has a grammar check that is to help you spell the words out correctly. This is why a computer is a useful thing to use. Computers don't make things go faster? But yet they do. They help you find information about many things on the internet. Also if you had to look up a person for a school project, I think you would find more things about that person that you would in books. It really does make things go faster. Computers do help you. They're not a waste of time. They are useful to every one. They also help things go faster for everyone.
1573	1577	1	3	"Dear Editor, Many people have used a computer to learn new things such as cultures. Computers effect people in so many positive ways. They changed the way people think and how they look at the world. Experts even say how computers change the way they act at home and in the public. It also helps special needs students learn how to read and spell. A lot of people have used computers to learn different cultures, which has helped our society in many ways. By educating youth so they don't make mistakes such as racial stereotyping. Computers helped people learn things besides racial issues in the past but also about their own culture, which has been proven by various news outlets. People state that computers have made citizens lose their daily exercise. But people don't only use the computer to study they also use it to find different exercises, different diets and ways to stretch their body so they won't hurt themselves. Less than ten percent studied that the computer diets and different exercises helped them to get fit. The local times has said, ""The computer not only help our fitness, but also help us stay in the know. Our computer keeps our world connected by one little click, and it gets there in less then a minute."" So as you can see computers have changed not only society but also the world. That's how big of an impact it has had."
1574	1578	1	3	Dear, Local Community Board I think that although computers are very helpful to society, they're also posing a problem to it. For example people are out there that are addicted to computers and will sit in a dark area for hours just on the computer. Also its not helping the fact that there is obesity in our nation. I will explain that to you but anyways this thing that is teaching our youth could very much hurt them. Computer junkies what are they? A computer junkie is someone who wakes up in the morning at six o'clock and stays on it for a good past ten hours. This is a problem that twenty percent of our American youth have. This topic may not be big to you but it is a problem you must know. My brother is addict to his laptop he spends hours in his bedroom watching anime, Japanese cartoons, and not eating anything the whole day. He never leaves his room and my mom got so tired of trying to drag him out of his room she just quit and it gets annoying after a while. A little computer isn't bad but a lot is. Obesity is a growing problem in our nation and computers aren't helping. In fact computers are making matters worse by having items being shipped to them. Instead of the obese person getting up and leaving they could lose a little weight, but now you can order offline and have it delivered to your door. Many online market such as food delivery services like Domino's and other places have been a part of this issue. Stop online food ordering from taking over. The computer is a great way to learn about things but it also a great way to become a junkie and fat.
1575	1579	1	3	Dear Editor, I believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also family that live far away, they also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand and even allow people to learn about far away places and people. First of all, computers have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away. For example half of my family live in another state and my mom uses the internet to communicate with them through video calls. Secondly, computers have a positive effect on people. They allow you to do homework that cant be done by hand. Such as essays that have to be typed and can't be hand written, and projects for school that require online research. Lastly, computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I first came into this country, I didn't know much about it, so I did some research online and learned great things about its history and culture. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away, they also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand, and even allow people to learn about faraway places and people.
1576	1580	1	3	Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a @ORGANIZATION2 student and I hear that some people think it is good to use computers and others think that its a waist of time. Well I have @NUM1 good reasons as to why computers are good technology. One reason is you can book places that you want to go or the sights you want to see. This is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route, you can even print a map and go hiking, which combines technology with physical activity (hows that for excersing). Another reason why computers are good to use is because of online chats. Let's say that you have a family member that lives all the way out in @LOCATION1 and they have a computer and you want to talk to them but it costs you to talk, you can e-mail them instead. This is a good way to use the computer because you can stay updated on what is going on with your family members without the expense of a long-distance call. Another reason is learning. You can learn about many different cultures from around the world. You can learn about different people and how they live their life and ther cultures, all from the comfort of your home. My last reason is the @CAPS1. This is a great way to use the computer because you can keep updated on the lafest things like the earthquake in hati; or a hurricane or a @CAPS1 breaking story. Or if their is a storm headey your way, you can get immediate warnings. In conclusion, using the computer has great ways to be used and sure people, put some bad sights out their but if you use it the right way it is a good source of technology for information and communication.
1577	1581	1	3	"Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most kinds would perfer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore, they don't enjoy natire like they should, and they spend less time with family and friends. If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day, seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exersize? Well that's the problem you don't get any exersize. Some might disagree with me but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count as physical activity! A recent survay has been conduched and @CAPS2 said that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer @PERCENT2 are over-weight or indanger of being over-weight. @CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @CAPS2 is ruining poeples lives. I go in the computer @CAPS1 too, but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now what about the beautiful things in nature @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on, some of us have @CAPS3 seen a day-lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day. This a facinating are might @CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance tecknology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know, that some will disagree by saying, ""but i am saying the rain forest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website."" @CAPS2's true you are helping but doing @CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better. For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park, which is real, hands-on work. The most important thing in life is family and friends, technology should @CAPS3 get in the way of that. If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have? Loving family and friends of course! If family is so importand then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer. Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents? That could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family. I might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world! I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but, I think technology is ruining some peoples lives. If you think about @CAPS2 a computer is like a @CAPS4-@CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating byt when you get the full force of @CAPS2, @CAPS2 traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people's health! All of us should get more exersize, spend more time in Nature, and be with family and friends more often than sitting on a chair glued to a computer screen for our own well-being."
1578	1582	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook, which helps maintain privacy. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth, which saves so much time. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial for all these positive reasons. Thank you for your time."
1579	1583	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think it's a good thing that people spend so much time on computers. One reason for this is when you type you learn hand-eye corrdination. Another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things. The last reason is because you can do things in seconds on a computer that would normaly take hours. Hand-eye coordination is an importand thing: for example you're walking down the street when a baseball flys at you, your able to cach it because of all the time you have bin on the computer has taught you hand-eye coordination. Their are lots of ways to get it, like playing sports, writting, or just playing with your thumbs but learning to type is by far the best way because you'll use the skill while you'r a kids and an adult, in many jobs. @CAPS3 trouble paying your phone bill? Guss what you don't need a phone, why not use your computer to call people sensa its free. Also you wont really need a cell phone because you can do everything that can do quicker on a computer anwway, like sending messages. Last of all its harder for poeple to steel or you to lose a computer as to a cell phone, which is often smaller. Have you ever got upset when treing to look for a peice of in formation in a book? Well you can be done with the hours of looking if you just use a computer, then you can get outside, and play games. Most of the time it takes me hours to do my homework, but is I had a computer it probly only take me minutes to do it with online resources. So for hand-eye coordination, having trouble with bills and it takeing to long to look thing up by other means I think its good that people spent time on computers and i hope you agree with these points.
1580	1584	1	3	Alot of people have different ideas on if they believe computers benefit society. I for one believe that computer are useful for many things. The first reason why I believe this, is because one a lot of schools will need them for students, to do projects. Second they have computer gamed to help kids learn. Third I believe its a good way to just relax. The first reason why believe computers are good is because many kids in school will need them. In school we have a lot of projects that we might need type or get a picture. If we didn't have computers there would be no way we could do that properly. Also if we do persuassive waiting pieces. We would need a computer to type it to make it looks better and more professional. Many people might say we could all just write it out. But I believe that typing it might be faster and neater for some people, and easier to edit. The second reason why I believe computers are good is because they have many good games to help people learn. I know that have many different games that are educational and fun for kids. Computers are good is because it's a a good way to relax. Aint of people get home from work or and are very tired. But instead of just going and sitting on the couch for the whole night you could go to the computer and do a fun game for a little while to unwind. Many people say that watching tv and going on the computer is the same things. But if you play an educational game once in a while it might be ok for your mind. But then you can do something fun on the computer every so often without guilt. In conclusion I believe computers are good because one many kids need them for school second they have a lot of educational games and its a good way to relax after a long day.
1581	1585	1	3	Do the members of this well-known and captivating newspaper think that the effects of people owning a computer are good or bad? Well, if you think negatively about computers and how they effect people, I would like to politely disagree. I'm certain I could sway you to agree with me too. Computers are positive for many reasons. The internet and other resources can be used for school, work, and other questions, the computer gives people something to do when otherwise they have nothing, and it allows people to talk to others online. There are many great effects computers have on and for people. Everybody has questions, wouldn't you agree? And more often than not, people don't know the answer right off the top of their head. Research is the key to answering questions. But who has time to go to the library and spend hours searching for an answer that would take a matter of seconds to find on the computer? Not every student, employee, or other person can spend that time looking for an answer. There are far too many other things to do! The internet on the computer allows people to find an answer quickly and efficiently. This can actually improve people's knowledge, and their performance at work or school. You can see here the positive effects of a computer. Have any of you ever been bored? I'm certain that you have. Everyone gets bored. Instead of sitting around doing nothing, people can go on the computer and do many activities. Contrary to some people's beliefs, this can be an excellent way to spend, not waste time. There are all sorts of educational games and mind-buggling puzzles to do on the computer. I'm certain you can see how much better these things are than sitting in front of the television. The effects are positive, because your brain is challenged, and your boredom has vanished. Also, hand-eye coordination can be greatly improved by doing these activities. These are so many positivities about the computers effect in people's boredom! People have friends, and it is only human to want to keep in close contact with them. But what if a close friend moves away? You don't want to lose that friendship right? People can write letters to each other, but that can be time consuming, and slow to delivery and response. And the positive effect of a computer is it allows you to keep in contact online with friends and family through instant messaging and email, both great resources for talking with others. Computers can keep friends together and save families from drifting apart. It is also good for couples or parents to keep in touch with their partner or children if they are away on a trip. These are all positive effects don't you agree? As you can see, I feel strongly that the computer has positive effects on people. It's good for research, it's something to do when someone is truly bored, and it enables friends and family to stay close via online communication. I strongly urge you to change your opinion from negative to positive about the effects of computers. Everyone can choose their own opinions, but I know you'll prove wise and agree with me!
1582	1586	1	3	"Dear, Newspaper People should use less time on the computer because it effects their lifestyle. Instead of using their computer all the time they should exercise, hang out with their friends and family and just enjoy nature. First of all computer's can bring a lot of obesity to the community because it bring lazyness and it makes peole not went to exercise. If people start to exercise at least around half of lazyness will go down. They should at least go out for a walk instead of using all their electrity. Also around a quarter of your electrity bill will go down if you go exercise instead of using computer. Secondly people need to start enjoying nature insteed of being on the computer at the time. People should go green and start recyling and not worrying about what somebody said on ""myspace"" or ""facebook"". Also if we started recyling and worring about nature a significant portion of the earth would be greener. My last reson being their should be more friendler family time enstead of computer time. Computers just make you break away from your family and friends because your worrying whats happening on the internet. A large percentage of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends. In my conclusion these are my reasons being for people so they wont use the computer so much and so they can just kick back chill with your friend and family, exercise and enjoy nature and lead a more balanced life."
1583	1587	1	3	Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exersice, they are not spending enough time outdoors and the dont spend as much time with their family and friends. Exersicing is an important part of one's daily schedued. I have a friend who exersices everyday. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends anytime on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her compleate oposite. He hardly ever exersices and spends several hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabeties and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exersice and too much computer time. Experts say that people should get at least thirty minutes of exersice every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at a major university show that a high percentage of kids under the age of twelve are obese or at the risk of becaming obese because they are not getting enough exersice. You don't want that number to increase do you? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend Sarah spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science poject because she was on her computer, rathern than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor James is a child phycologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, a majority of them said computer. This shows that people on computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high. Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face to face time, not just video chatting with your friends on facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend Emily didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get together, she was ostrisized because she didn't go to the reunion. High school guidance counselor Mr. Davis says that many out of ten friendships are ruined because kids dont spend enough face to face time with their friends but are on the computer. These are all god reasons why less time on the computer and more time exersicing, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier.
1584	1588	1	3	"Dear Editors of The Local Newspaper: As students are promoted to higher grade levels, more teachers will require research papers. In my opinion having a computer helps me complete my research paper and the contents in it are the best it can be. What makes students and parents more happy to see high marks on their child's paper? Advances in technology. there should be advances in technology because they teach hand-eye coordination, it gives the ability to learn about far away places, and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. To begin there should be advances in technology beacause it teaches hand-eye coordination. In a recent poll seen in TIME magazine, it showed that a high percentage of people who use computers had a large increase in their coordination, people were not as clumsy and poorly coordinated. John Smith, a professional tennis player stated that, ""Before I started using a computer, I always, would play tennis for living and it was a bad choice because I was poorly coordinated. I always missed the tennis ball in matches. So I decided to stop. Then I started to use the computer more and my coordination improved. Now I barely miss any tennis balls."" Therefore, having advances in technology will improve and teach hand-eye coordination. Another reason there should be advances in technology is because it gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Jane Doe a writer from National Geographic stated that, ""People like to research a place before they go on vacation or a buisness trip because they would like to know more about it."" Not knowing anything about your vacation destination is like not knowing what's for dinner tonight, it is clearly unreasonable. Recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination the more enjoyable it is. Thus, the more vacations they go one which is profitable for airplane companies. Also knowing about the different cultures of the people in far away places gives people a better perspective of the world they live in. Thus, having advances in technology will give the ability to learn about far away places and people. Furthermore, having advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. Mark Zuckerberg the creator of Facebook stated that, ""Having online chat programs will help people communicate with each other. Facebook has been beneficial to everybody. For example, it helps people re-connect with their former friends. It is also very beneficial to students because if they forget a homework assignment they can log onto Facebook and ask a classmate."" A recent article found on the internet, showed that online chat programs helped people communicate with each other. Therefore, having advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. In conclusion, having advances in technology will improve hand-eye coordination, teach people about far away places and people, and allows people to talk online with other people. When voting on this decision please take part and support advances in technology, it will be beneficial to everybody. Thank you for your time."
1585	1589	1	3	Dear editors of the Daily Times, Every morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the internet. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physicly, and mentaly, for sure. My aunt an former physisist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, partly because of these new ideas involving phones and i-pods are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into commiting a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, just last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like? My brother learned swearing from the new & advanced game of Battlefield. It's a fighting game indeed! I implore your company to make the righty decision and write to help pull us off of our butts and get us up and going strong again. I hope you take my advice, and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort to consider this important matter.
1586	1590	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm sitting at the couch thinking about what I should do for vacation. I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to do some creative writing, but my notebooks are all scattered, I don't know how to quickly contact someone who could help and I have no idea about the country that I plan to visit. I take a last look at my notebooks strewn about the closet looking very much like a tornado swept through and I find the solution on the highest shelf: my laptop. First, I highly agree with the people who think computers are useful. Three effects they have on people who use them usually are fantastic. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop might be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances apart, so they use email and video conferencing. They travel places with people at their fingertips. However a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people. Their schedule could be chaotic. Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective. Take my story for example. My mom hates wasting, so instead of me driving to a friend we video call. Saves money and time! In addition, I happen to be a writer who writes often everyday in many notebooks. I've written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling all over my room. What organizational tool could help me in this situation? Why a laptop of course! One laptop or computer can store a bunch of files and makes editing a breeze. Anyone who works with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer! Would you prefer a room full of notebooks that you have to buy more of, or a single, sleek computer with tons of space and back up? You tell me. Computers encourage users to be more organized! Respectively, computers are a resource for millions of pages of information. They're similar to libraries. But think about a library and then imagine a computer. One you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some might argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org' and '.gov' and even '.edu'. These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research. By using computers I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial. They have effectively made me more intelligent as a person. In conclusion, it's my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects, and these include money/gas-saving conversations through video calls and email, better organization, and increased intelligence from reading. I've decided to take my creative writing on my laptop and in doing so learned to weather the storm.
1587	1591	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, It has come to my attention that you have asked people to tell their opinions on the effects computers have on people. In my opinion computers do not have a good effect. The reason I think that is because kids are on the computer instead of doing their homework, people do not exercise as much because they are always on the computer and they do not spend as much time with their family and friends. There are many kids that go on the computer all night and never get to doing their homework. I read an article that said, ""Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework."" People get so distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes don't do their homework because they get distracted on the computer. I interviewed a student in the eighth grade and she said, ""Our class instantly gets all homework done but sometimes we forget when we are on the computer. That is really the only reason we don't do it."" So computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of them. But that is not the only bad thing about them. Since people are always on computers they don't get out and exercise as much. Instead they sit and play games on a computer. I found this quote in an article I was reading ""Ever since I started spending a lot of time on the computer I have gained weight because I am not out exercising,"" Exercising and going outside is a very important thing to do but people cannot do it if they are always on the computer. Nine out of ten people say that ever since they started going on the computer a lot, they have not gone outside or exercised in a while. I interviewed a woman and she said, ""I had to not go on the computer for a while because I realized that it was not good for me and I needed exercise."" People get so distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore. There are still some reasons why computers are not very good. Spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do, but with computers people do not do that much anymore. In a magazine I read it said, ""People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are keeping people from spending time together. Nine out of ten families say that they have realized they don't spend as much time together because of computers. I interviewed some kids and they said, "" I don't spend a lot of time with family or friends. I am mostly on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are definitely not a good thing for families. Those are the reasons why I think computers do not have a good effect on people. Kids are on the computer and don't do their homework, people do not exercise as much and they don't spend as much time with family or friends."
1588	1592	1	3	Computers are really cool. Do you know my website is CoolSite1.com? We need to limit our time on them, let's mention it. I truly love the computers. We need to remember that computers are great machines. They help us play and learn new things every single day. We should use them wisely and make sure to also play outside. Computers are a wonderful part of our modern world, and we are lucky to have such amazing technology to use for fun and for schoolwork. We need to make sure computers are used in a positive way for everyone.
1589	1593	1	3	As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has an extremely positive effect on people. Computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer does are; teach hand-eye coordination, give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last but not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explain more about what a positive effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just games and playing video games on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. When you use the computer there is so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a project in your social studies or history class about a country or a city and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto your computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about France that you would have never known until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand-eye coordination. First you need to learn about the layout of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skill, you should try to look at the computer screen and not be looking down at your fingers on the keys. Not only is that not helping your hand-eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truly is unbelievable. Are you one of those people who's parents don't let you get a phone because of how much it costs without even the cost of texting? Well if you are, the computer can help you out with that problem as well!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use an instant messenger to chat with your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The computer is so handy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world, helps with hand-eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the computer is a necessity in every household.
1590	1594	1	3	Dear Editor, many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. I came to disagree; computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read and see other places we thought we would never know about; and instead of having to hand write that book we can type it up. I find these are reasons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagine you are on Facebook and you type in your best friend from high school's name; she pops up and you are connected on the net. The next day she is online, happy you are connected. That's the kind of thing that happens everyday; people reconnect, and this not only happens on Facebook, but all over the internet! Reconnecting with friends and family, talking to your boss next door, you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in another state. Having computers really allows us to reconnect to those we have lost. Other cultures are very important. But what if we know nothing about other cultures? Then what would life be like? With computers we can instantly learn about other countries, unlike having to go to the library; all you have to do is type in the place and pick the site you want to look at, all with using computers. Long ago people would have to write out everything word by word, letter by letter. Not with computers. So don't worry about that long paper, you can just type it and with some software, you can even get your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school children but adults too. That business proposal can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology, life gets easier, and the computer gives more time for other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effect is just helpfulness for everyone in their daily lives.
1591	1595	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is they help make every day life easier. First off, you can chat with people from long distances. Also, it makes homework, and finding information a lot easier as well. Last but not least when you have nothing else to do, you can play games, and watch videos from online. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with my friends. Even if they are across the country, you can still chat with them, for free, using various messaging applications! Also, if you can't get in touch with them, you can send them an e-mail, and as soon as they log on, they will get your message. Best of all, when you forget to write your homework down, you can go online, and ask one of your friends what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is make a word document, and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil, as mistakes can be corrected easily. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater and more professional looking. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer, and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it teaches hand-eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games, that any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes homework much easier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when they're bored, or have nothing to do. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people, because of all the things they offer, and help us on. Thank you.
1592	1596	1	3	Dear Editor, I agree that computers had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive effect on people. Spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so important that schools have throughout school teaching us how to type. We also use hand-eye coordination in computer games. You have to keep your eye on the screen and move your arms and hands to hit the correct keys. Computers are helpful in many ways. Have you ever wondered about what a faraway place looks like or what would be found on it? With a computer you can find out instantly. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get pictures of some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who live there. Yes, you could do this in a social studies book but it is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life easier. Computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. They give you the opportunity to talk with people online whether they are across the world or down the street. In order to do this you need a webcam. They are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. It's a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about their culture if they are from a different country. It's almost like a pen pal lasting friendship through a computer. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spending too much time on computer and not on exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. All of these things should be considered. All you have to do is manage your time. Do not spend all day on the computer. If you do this then everyone will see that computers have a positive effect and are one of the best inventions created. I would like to thank all of the readers for their time and hope that you all support me and my ideas.
1593	1597	1	3	North County Courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, they can benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that they help with hand-eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly they provide another way for people to communicate. Hand-eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the United States, that revolves around sports, hand-eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand-eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the United States to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the United States so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decrease. Well how do computers help with hand-eye coordination you ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like lumosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. They help with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little games. As you can see in the United States we need improved hand-eye coordination and computers could do many positive things for the country. We can improve our skills just by using a computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things is amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. With the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they would have never known before. They also help kids find information for reports and school projects. There are truly many things you can learn on the internet. You can learn about history or science. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word success that is a key to life. You can get so much knowledge from the computers and internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or cell phones, but for the ones who don't they need a means of communication. On the computer you can use instant messaging or email; or use social media like twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you know is overseas, instead of wasting money on a long distance call just use one of the systems I've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north county courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are they teach hand-eye coordination, help people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly they allow another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefit society and do have positive effects.
1594	1598	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to recent studies over one billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to a survey about seventy percent of teens spend most of their time on a computer. Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one and wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook. There are many people on the computer and it must be stopped. In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to a tech website, the average adult gets about five to ten viruses a year. My friend was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then a few seconds later the computer said you have a virus. The next day he told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About half of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as McAfee and Norton, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. Many people who say that a virus was caught by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to a health report the average person between the ages of ten and twenty spend more then seven hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for goodness sake! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About a quarter of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible.
1595	1599	1	3	"Dear Editor, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe they can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. If it was computers against books I definitely would concur with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even if you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads Hawaii tails Florida, if you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place! Go fly there and surf the totally radical waves. Surf the real waves next to the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to California or Colorado or Hawaii. Who knows, it will definitely be an experience, for sure."
1596	1600	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you really think we shouldn't have computers or @CAPS2 you think we shouldn't? Well I say we should because computers has everything you need as in info, games, school, websites where you can buy clothes. Others say no for some reason; why they say it's not good for you and too addictive, I clearly think that it is appropriate. Having computers, it absolutely helps us learn, whatever you needed to learn a computer has it. If you wanted to learn about other places besides the one you live in, you could find it on the computer. I remember one time when I was looking for a word in the dictionary and they didn't have it, and I looked it up on the computer and they had it; I thought it was magnificent. I love computers; it connects me with my family that are in far away places. There's nothing better than that because you could talk to your family all day or whenever you want. Computers have everything, any info you need get it off of the computer. It lets you stay alert on what's happening today in the world. It really does work on your hand and eye coordination. ""@CAPS3't that brilliant?"" Some say computers are not good because people are not enjoying nature. Or people start to not want to get out of the house; you don't spend time with your family because you're so addicted to it. Some say you're not exercising or nothing so you get too fat, or too skinny and you're not healthy at all. But I disagree, that's why I @CAPS2 not like writing this side of the story. ""@CAPS4 kidding."" @CAPS5 you have a chance because computers are the best; they are definitely not the baddest, but after reading this you couldn't agree with me more so it's @CAPS5 to agree or never to disagree. The big question is what will you choose! This is not a hard decision to make, and I am confident you will see the immense value computers bring to our modern lives."
1597	1601	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 reading your paper weekly and @CAPS2 up with local events, I was able to retrieve the information of a controversy dealing with the effects of computers. I for one think that the computer has come to be one of the greatest inventions ever created. It has @CAPS3 changed our society, and if you ask me, in a very positive way. My first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses. You can practically discover anything in the blink of an eye, as opposed to a book or going to the library, which is very time consuming. Not only does a computer take far less time to get information, it also holds a much larger amount of information than a library can store. Computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable, but best of all, it's right at your fingertips. Another great characteristic of the computer is its ability to let people @NUM1 miles apart converse freely. This might just be the greatest thing about the computer. Chatting online completely erases the hassle of @CAPS4 phone bills and carrying around cell phones. You can speak with friends half way around the world with no cost to you, amazing!!! The one thing that is faulty about the computer is its overusage by children. Although this is a significant problem, it is not the computer's fault. Kids should know the limit. There should be @ORGANIZATION1 for both being on the computer and for exercise and fun with friends. This problem has most likely influenced many to come to dislike the computer, but you must understand that the time children spend on the computer is entirely up to him/her or the parents. In @CAPS5, I hope I have persuaded you enough to agree with my thoughts and to give the computer a chance; I'm sure you'll be satisfied with its many benefits and capabilities.
1598	1602	1	3	Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastly people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate; on the computer there are many ways. There are chat rooms that have typing to each other. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example; he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until business came along. His business transferred @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because otherwise he would not have been able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person who is transferred far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene, a psychiatrist, states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on business, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2; he is a teacher and always has to do his students' grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer; this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh air while doing their job. @PERSON1 proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working outdoors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vacation. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for a week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vacation because they don't know about the country or place, a problem easily solved with a simple computer search.
1599	1603	1	3	To the local Newspaper, I think using computers does not have a negative effect on people. I believe it's an advantage to use it. You are given technology, an advantage, so why not use it? They give people a chance to chat with people and allow them to make friends. These days people even watch shows on the computer on websites such as: @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 allows them to search anything and watch it on @CAPS1. People make emails, download music and several other things. Children at the age of @NUM1, @NUM2, even @NUM3, use computers to play games on them. I have a cousin who is @NUM3 and he plays games on it all the time; he even knows how to search something on the computer. Some people @MONTH1 think it gives you a negative effect, but really it doesn't. Those people think that and should come to reality. We have to step up as life goes on. Let's say a girl doesn't have a computer; her parents think that computers spoil children, that technology spoils children. The girl goes to school, her friends ask her to give them her e-mail. Every time her friends ask her about email she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject. This time she made an excuse, but how many times is she going to make up an excuse? Then suppose one day her friend finds out she doesn't have a computer and embarrasses her in front of everyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that you have to see around you and go on with it. Computers also save your time. You can just type instead of writing everything out. You can make your writing cursive or any other style that you would like. After reading my letter, I hope you understand my point. Next time you see a person who thinks computers give negative effects to people, tell them the advantages of the computers and how it benefits society around you, helping them see the positive impact of this essential tool.
1600	1604	1	3	Although many people love to be on the computer playing video games and having cyber chats, most of them don't know how bad a computer can be. Even though I experience a great time on the computer, I know how bad it is. Here is a short example. You can experience problems with your computer; if you stay on the computer for too long it can overheat and that can cause it to stop working. Another problem is side effects. You can get headaches from just staring at the screen for too long. Those headaches over time can become even worse. You @MONTH1 even get poor vision from a computer. Computers can also be addicting. Because of your addiction with computers, you @MONTH1 become less close with family or friends, causing your social life to be very minimal. Also, because of the addiction, it @MONTH1 work its way into your daily routines, causing you to have to play it daily and more than the average person does. Your personality @MONTH1 also change with your social life and routine. Lastly, computers can be very dangerous. If your child gets on to one, he @MONTH1 accidentally link himself to a dirty or bad website. He then is exposed to the negatives of a computer. On a computer, your child will probably be shown things like words or pornographic features. These are all things that should not be allowed to access on a computer. Computers are addicting, they cause problems and are dangerous; in my opinion, their wrong use should be stopped. Now you think about what we should do about computers and their potential harms in our daily lives.
1601	1605	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think the effects of computers are good. Some reasons I think this is that we get a lot of knowledge from it, and we can contact people you don’t live near and haven't seen in a while. My first reason why I think the effects of computers are good is because you can get a lot of knowledge from it. One example would be if you want to make a special meal, you wouldn’t find it in an ordinary cookbook; you would have to look up on the internet for the recipe. Another example is if you wanted to travel to a distant city by car and you didn’t have a map, how would you get the directions? You would go on the computer, look up directions to that city and print it out. You would have never been able to go there if you didn't have a map or a computer to guide you. My second reason why I think the effects of computers is good is because you can contact friends or family that you have not seen in a while. One example would be if your sister just graduated from college and you wanted to congratulate her but you were thousands of feet in the air on an airplane and all you had was your laptop and your luggage, you would e-mail her saying good job right away. These are just a few reasons why I think the effects of computers is good, and I hope the local newspaper agrees too.
1602	1606	1	3	"Do you want your child to succeed in life? This is why computers are valuable to everyday life. Computers help children get more education, they can be independent and not have anyone tell them how to use a computer, and when they get to college they can take notes quickly and not fall behind. This is why computers are important to everyday life. Computers are important because your child will get the proper education that they need. A high percentage of children who use the internet for studies are the ones that will be a grade ahead of the rest of his or her classmates. Dr. Smith, a computer expert, says, ""When I was using the computer to do research on a topic, I went on the internet and from there I was a step ahead because I was on the computers."" As you can see computers are valuable items used in everyday life. Computers are important to everyday life because it helps your children be more independent and learn how to use different parts of the internet. Many children who use the internet are most likely to succeed in college because they know what websites to go to and how to get there. There is a good chance that the children who succeed in college will get the higher paying jobs because they've learned how to use technology effectively. The computer expert also says, ""My son was at a university, and he was smart because he was always on the computer looking up new facts and ideas that popped into his head."" He is a student which is very hard to get into that school. This is why computers are valuable to everyday life. Computers are important because you can look up sites that will help you eat healthy foods. Many adults who eat healthy foods are most likely to live an even longer years of their life because they are keeping their bodies in health conditions because they've eating more fruits, and drinking more to keep their bones strong for when they fall as they get older. As you can see, using the internet can be very helpful if you used it the right way. This is why using the internet will help you be the successful person that you want to be in life."
1603	1607	1	3	"Dear whoever this may concern, I think that people spend way too much time on computers. They do not exercise as much. People sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy nature. Families and friends are spending less time together because they have computers to talk to each other. Computers have become a negative influence on people today. People need exercise to live. It keeps us healthy. With all the fast food places people need exercise more now than ever. People do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on. A statistic is that many students each have their own computer in the house. They said ""I would much rather be on the computer than outside"" according to a student at the local school. Even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer. Humans only have so long to live. There is beautiful nature outside. We do not enjoy our surrounding because we would rather be on the computer. For example, a person would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us. Very few students enjoy nature every week. A young girl never appreciated nature until her parents made her stay off the computer for a month. She now loves nature because it got boring day after day on the computer. Family and friends are huge parts of our life. We want them to be a part of our big events. Because of the computer we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event. But would it not be much better for them to be there, cheering you on when it is happening. When I was younger my grandparents used to come to my soccer games, but now they do not because my mom just records it for them to watch. I liked it so much better when they were at the soccer games, supporting me. ""My family and friends are the ones I want at my events, not to just show them after the event happened. A common feeling is that everyone wants to share their event with their family. Computers aren't that great. They make it so family and friends do not come to see you. Computers take you away from the beautiful nature that surrounds us. It limits you on exercise and makes you gain weight, which is unhealthy. I urge you to use your computer less and exercise, see family, and enjoy nature."
1604	1608	1	3	"I think that computers are bad because you can have arthritis in your finger, loss of vision, and you also should go outside to get fresh air. It is not good to sit on the computer because you can get arthritis in your fingers. There is also a disease called carpal tunnel that makes it so you can't really grasp anything anymore. My grandma has arthritis in her fingers but it is not from the computer; it is from doing dishes all the time. But when she does something she complains that her fingers hurt. So I think that if she is doing dishes, I think the keyboard will do much more damage and will effect you for the rest of your life. My mom always told me that if I sit in front of the screen too long I will go blind. Well in a magazine it said that ""if you sit in front of a computer for too long it will partially blind you. So if you sit in front of a computer doing Facebook or something, what's the difference, that will partially blind you. It is good to go outside sometimes to get fresh air or go for a walk; those are some ways to stay in shape because if you get obese then you will die. If all you do is sit in front of the computer you need to get exercise every day to stay fit and healthy; that is the way to be instead of eating junk food and drinking soda. I'm sure it's ok to go on the computer if you look up other health stuff to do. What I'm getting at is it is good to go on the computer sometimes but it can be very unhealthy to sit in front of it. You need to be healthy to stay alive and if you sit in front of it all day then the results wouldn't be good. Those are the reasons why I think the computer is bad to sit in front of all day."
1605	1609	1	3	"Dear Editor, Over the years computers have gotten faster, smaller, and smarter. These advances have led to mankind as we know it advancing, but the effects that come with them may be non-profitable to the youth of the computer world. Some common effects computers have on people, mostly children, are preventing kids to play outside, to be active; computers prevent people from using their imagination and they also are a waste of time. Everyday a child across America will use the same old excuse, ""no mom, I'm not on Facebook, I'm doing my school report"", while in fact they haven't even started it, or they finished hours ago and are now goofing around online. But ask yourself, ""did this happen thirty years ago?"" No, your parents who grew up then were thrilled to go outside when their assignments were completed. They could not wait to get on that flaming red bike to go play ball with Joey. Kids these days are becoming less active and eager to play outside. Some people blame obesity on genetics while it probably should be blamed on computers, sucking children to them. Because kids never want to leave the side of their beloved computer to go outside they are using less and less of their imagination. Parents tell stories of when they would watch the one new episode of their favorite show and the whole week the kids in the neighborhood would take roles and act it out. But do you see that every day in this generation? Not at all. No one thinks or imagines anything new about it with friends to make it more fun; they only move onto the Wii five minutes later to play a smashing balloons game. Computers just use up all of your time; the average kid will spend up to four hours on the computer just fooling around with no purpose. Wasting the time they could be improving homework or walking the dog; the time is not being donated to a good source. It is not being effective most times. They say computers are the now generation but does that mean that the now generation must be lazy, unimaginative, and not care what their time is put towards? Most people will say no we are not, but you offer a nine year old to play on the computer or, oh say go outside! You would be ignorant to think they would go out to play. People want to move forward but can we not make a compromise between technology and a healthy, active life?"
1606	1610	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, full of interaction and online chat. It was extremely exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded inside as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dug while computers are still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Professor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worrying about anything except their computer? The only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waste @PERCENT2 of their spare time on their computer. If technology decreases the new games people play, and sites people use, it is likely for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said ""I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using their computers and internet. It's been quite some time since over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend."" @PERSON1 later mentions ""it's kind of depressing how much time they spend on computers, rather than outside and enjoying nature."" Not only is exercising time headed down the drain, but our used to be ""beautiful"" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials, their parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1 hours a day. Since adults aren't doing their part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy, the kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremely off the wall; our nature is going from beautiful to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official, has surveyed @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly just enjoying nature and realizing the beauty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoroughly breathes in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minutes a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming wouldn't be necessary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old and I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very known in our town but I have no clue who they are! This is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents kept me in my house as they used the computer. The other day I just found out what ""outside"" is because my mom's computer broke and now I am getting introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer broke she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, contribute to global warming, and/or not interact with family or outside nature? It's sad how @PERCENT3 of these reasonings are caused by the excessive use of technology and computers. Let's just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!"
1607	1611	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are very important to some people. Everyone uses them or has used them before. It isn't bad to own a computer because you can still exercise and be able to do the things you do everyday. Let's say that you need to look something up; the thing you always go to for information is a computer. People in schools, industries, and in homes use it all the time. Teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games; I know I do. It's so they don't waste their time being bored all day. Exercising and being active is indeed very good for teenagers to really look into, but even though they do that, they don't push away the computer. It will always be there when they don't have anymore homework or when they finish running around the neighborhood with their friends. I can't imagine what my life would be like coming home from soccer practice and done with my homework and the computer or @CAPS1 is not one of the first places I run to so I can just sit back and relax. Computers should be known as our friends. They won't hurt us. They just give us what we need and want. Research is a good example because everyone uses the computer to find whatever it is that people are looking for on it. And if they're done with researching they can have a little fun with games and friends. But I believe that the main purpose for computers is information. Whenever I get home from school, I finish my homework and stretch a little for cheerleading, then watch @CAPS1 or go on the computer so I'm not bored. It's not that I'm not active because I'm not working out or exercising. It's because I have nothing to do, so why not make my time occupied? Everyone does it so I'm not the only one. Yes, computers are just this square box with a keyboard, but if you don't push it away from people's common lives then you can see that they aren't what you say they are and they won't rot people's brains or anything. The reason they are in an office or living room or bedroom is because people like them and use them for their needs, integrating seamlessly into daily routines.
1608	1612	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, What do people do when they need to write a report? Or talk to a business partner, friend, or family? Modern computers help us do all of that. The electronic wonder improves our lives everyday. Yet some people refuse to accept computers are now a part of every day life. Computers help us communicate, research different topics, and have just plain fun things to do. Computers make it easy to communicate. Things like ""email"" and ""facebook"" let us talk with each other. Some might contest ""Why not use a phone or go out."" But what if they're away on a trip, or live thousands of miles away? With computers everything is easier. Computers allow us to research topics we need for classes or work. ""You can get a lot of detailed information from thousands of sites. Sceptics might ask the question ""Why not go to a library."" Some of us might prefer to stay at home. Another reason is, that it maybe snowy, or the library is closed. Whatever the reason, computers make research fast and easy. Computers also fulfill a great need to entertain ourselves. Games sites like ""facebook"" have become very popular. They can provide us with emotional release from the everyday world. A potential argument might be ""Why not go outside?"" The weather could be bad and you're sick. Computers are fun, educational and a communication wonder. We should find the good in computers and see what they could do for their users in a positive light."
1609	1613	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on society because it gives a lot of information, it has lots of fun games and music, and it informs you about issues in the world and communities. The first reason I think that computers have a positive effect on society is because it gives you lots of information. If you need to do projects and research, what better way to do them than on a computer. You can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and people that made a change in the world. You can also look up and study different kinds of plants and animals, and you can find fascinating experiments to do. The second reason I think that computers have a positive effect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music. You can go on the @CAPS1 channel website and play lots of different games from your favorite TV shows. They also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your @ORGANIZATION2 tests such as comprehension clinic. The computer also has lots of music that you can listen to. You can listen to @ORGANIZATION1's album. I am sure before you buy it, or sample songs before buying the @NUM1 tracks. The final reason I think that computers have a positive effect on society is because it gives you information about issues in the world. You can go on a computer and search up natural disasters like the @CAPS8 earthquake, the @CAPS9 earthquake, or information about the tsunami that @MONTH1 hit @LOCATION2. You can search up current events and get information. You can search your favorite artist and see what their album is gonna be like or you can search for issues in your community. That is why I think computers have a positive effect on society because it gives information, it has lots of games and music, and it talks about important issues that matter to us all.
1610	1614	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers are beneficial to our society. For example, computers are very helpful to everybody. Computers also travel news faster. And they can teach us new things. I am not saying computers don’t have their downsides, but computers also have their upsides. Computers are very helpful in many ways. They help people find lost family members, and they help police officers find many criminals. Haven't you lost someone in your family, or haven't spoken to them in years and always wanted to find them and get back in touch with them? Well that's what computers are for. Also haven't you been concerned about the many criminals on the street, and wanted to get them off the streets and in jail where they belong but didn't have a way to do that? Computers help. Haven't you noticed that computers are helping police protect many women in the present time? Computers help people in the community, but they help information travel faster. For example, say you heard there was a hurricane or tornado and you needed to find out how to prepare. All you have to do is go on the computer and look it up. Also, if there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and the news didn't have information to help you, you would just go on the computer and find all the information you need. Computers are a source of many things for they help you. Computers teach you a lot, like hand-eye coordination. Think about it, you might not notice it while you are on the computer, but it helps. If you observe yourself while you are on the computer you would start to see that you are typing faster and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now, more than when you saw your first computer. Computers, though, not only teach you hand-eye coordination but they also teach you about many wonderful places. Such as @CAPS2 falls, rain forests etc. Now, don't get me wrong, I am not saying that computers don't have their downsides and that people don't take advantage of computers. But, I am saying that they help society a lot. They travel news faster. Also they have taught a lot to people. So take my opinion into consideration and think about how much computers have done for you and the world around you.
1611	1615	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a @ORGANIZATION1 who believes that computers have a positive effect on people for one computed help promote hand-eye coordination. @CAPS5 there is the fact that computers also help teach people about distant places and people without leaving they're home. @CAPS6 computers also allow people to talk to each other via the @CAPS3. What would we do without computer! My fist reason why I believe that computer are a good thing is hand-eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye @CAPS4 you have to watch what keys you are using when typing, your brain builds a connection with your hand, thus better eye hand coordination, ""@CAPS5 there is the fact that millions of @LOCATION1 are in car acidents a year, wich @PERCENT1 are cause by the fact that the driver of a vehicle had to look down at the whey to make that they kept thier car. On that road, this being that they have no eye hand coordination, @CAPS6 I that it computers were in the of every person in the world there would be less acidents a year. Secondly there is the fact that a computer can transport somebody in there mind. to a distant and or person. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT2 of people surveyed can find information on the @CAPS3 faster than they can in a @CAPS7 there is the fact that a child of any age can use a computer to find the specific information it needs in a matter of seconds. @CAPS6 I have observed that children know how to use the @CAPS3 but not a dictionary or encyclopedia, @CAPS6 there is the fact that people can contact and talk to people through the @CAPS3 for one this allows you to contact a long lost friends. @CAPS5 there is the fact that you can talk to theme @CAPS5 @CAPS6. There is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your @CAPS3. How cool is that @CAPS9 reading this letter and sharing it to your company I believe that you should support my cause. This is @CAPS4 computers improve hand-eye coordination, link people to other people and places and @CAPS6 allow people to talk via the @CAPS3, making them an essential and positive force in our modern world."
1612	1616	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living for the betterment of all."
1613	1617	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far away places: and people have educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First of all computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. When I was in sixth grade I had to do a project on @ORGANIZATION1 didn't know anything about him. But, luckily we have computers so I was able to @ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wodd or information on him and got an a plus on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade I had to do a project on @LOCATION1. I went on a computer went on @CAPS1.com a get lots of imformation and got on a plus. The second reason computers are benefitial to the society is because computers have educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 saids, ""@CAPS2 percent of the computers websites are educational. I also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on @CAPS3. com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time. Last but not the least, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. Theres a website calle myspace.com and it allows me and other people to talk online around the world. I asked my class and ninety percent of them go on myspace.com. On the other hand the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. Theres a website called @NUM1.com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven. Now, you know my reasons, why computers are good to the society, they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, have educational websites, and even allow people to tlak to other people online. What is your choice in these actions, for I believe the benefits clearly outweigh the drawbacks."
1614	1618	1	3	Dear local newspaper I've come across this letter I saw about the technology of computers and how it's affecting people lives. I think the computer is a great of learning. Itís a new way to study and do other things to learn in a fun way. My opinion is when you have to for a test, quiz or anything if can become boring. I like to study in a fun way that will to my head and I want it when is the computer to have I learn alot from the computer when im at home. my mam & dad think i spend alot @CAPS1 I do sometimes but half the time im studing test. Now i would like to the time to talk about is mentally when you go to learn. Physicly preasure or everything to You can learn different as well just log on to this has to choose them. Lastly family and friends. Family and friends are important websites like @CAPS2, facebook, aim and @CAPS3't that cool. Thats the beauty of computers and technology letting you do alot of things with only using on device. Thank you for giving me the oportunity to say my opion and what I think. I hope you take my letter and into consideration, as computers truly offer a valuable and engaging way to learn and connect in our modern world.
1615	1619	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 news paper I have over heard this debate on weather computers are good influinces on people or not. I am sending you this message to state my opinion on the matter and in my opinion I think the computer has very good efects on people. Not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments. There are many reasons why it has a good effect on people but the first and maybe one of the most important is it is an amaizing learning tool. When people are on the internet they could learn just about anything they want to on the giant mass of information we call the internet. It not only dose this but people learn how to do things through simulators from flying a plane to driveing a car. There is even more learning ability on the internet because a lot of people get home schooled on it through the internet and this @MONTH1 be an important part of their education because they might not be able to go to school because they are alway on the road or they move a lot of whatever their reason is. The computer is an important part in the invancement of the people's education. Not only can people use the computer in education but it is used as a tool in many ways, lets say your making a movie and need special effects they will use of photo shop or you need to collect and store changing information like lets say you want to stack you can always or down on a computer. Even if you were a construction worker you could your blue prints with pinpoint accuracy. Another less important thing about the computer is it gives many people entertainment. Lets you come home your bored you have nothing to do play a video game look around on the internet, it is also an important way of getting their music and or videos. This also effects many buissness and if the buissness go under becaus people werent moving ther stuff a lot of jobs will be lost and that is the last thing we need. The government also relies highly on the internet. They need it to make plans, save soldiers, and comunicate with other countries. And last but not the least we have the fitness and wellfare of the people useing computers. All I can really say to that is it is their decision. If they get off they can and if they won to sit there and waste or not, the overall positive impact of computers on learning, business, and governance is undeniable and vital for our society's progress.
1616	1620	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking is if computers benefit society? I believe that computers don’t because you can’t get exercise if you're always on the computers and it's really hard to enjoy nature too, as you are indoors staring at a screen. Another reason computers don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family in a meaningful way. Hopefully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise? It's proven that more than half of the United States is over weight, a problem linked to sedentary lifestyles. Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something useful that you know is better wouldn't you do it? Interacting with people is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don't then you might learn to be shy and not make as many friends as you like. It's true that you can make new friends over the computer but it's not the same as meeting them in person, where you can share real experiences. Also if you do make a ""friends"" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer, which poses a real danger. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. Knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the people you like, wouldn't you do that? Yes you can play games on the computer but it would be better if you play them with your family, fostering real connections. To answer the question everyone is asking I believe that computers don't benefit society at all and hopefully I have encouraged you to believe this too and to reconsider your screen time."
1617	1621	1	3	"Dear Editor, If you believe that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding; computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well-developed hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others, bridging distances. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. With new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. A researcher of a leading university says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost eighty percent of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" Knowledge and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her business degree online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable knowledge online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. If they have a report on a historical event or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. A noted psychologist, a doctor that specializes in human emotions/feelings says in the latest journal last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and if we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communicate; it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in another country, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, so we catch up by messaging each other by social networks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertise and many other things efficiently. Computers are essential and effective technology that are used by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain knowledge and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others, making this another great and useful step in our communities around the world."
1618	1622	1	3	There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes, accessing a wealth of information instantly. Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors, making communication effortless. Lastly they teach us hand-eye coordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life, improving dexterity. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries may be inquisitive about where they came from. They may also wonder how other countries are doing government wise or even economically with stocks. All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge at our fingertips. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes your life much easier and the faster you can look up some piece of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. Also radios and television stations might be a little off with their accuracy. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate and timely. Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them face-to-face. My grandma was in the hospital once and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was to young. Since the technology of webcams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least I was able to see if she was doing okay, which was a great comfort. Webcams are a good way also in discussions to see facial expressions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. If you have a webcam you can talk to each other on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not, preventing misunderstandings. Technology may be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and may be the best one that will ever be made. That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that is acquired through practice. This is an important skill because it allows you to succeed in life such as having to write clearly. This skill is also important if you have a job that involves computers because you need to know how to type and move your fingers fast if you want to succeed in this well paid job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other successful jobs in the world, from surgeons to artists. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand-eye coordination you should get a computer because it will help a lot through regular use. However if you get a computer you must update it regularly so your computer will not become slow and start crashing on you, ensuring its longevity. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do many things such as check news and see how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you live in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye coordination. Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would need to succeed in life and stay connected.
1619	1623	1	3	Dear School Board Members, Some people these days rely too much on technology. Everywhere you go you usually see somebody on a phone, texting, on a computer or plugged into an ipod. These people are not necessarily bad, but they are under the control of technology, which dictates their daily routines. Computers for example, are in the eyes of most people, fast, easy and fun, but they also pose as a problem. Even though it seems like everybody has a computer, not everybody does, creating a digital divide. Also people become way too dependent on such machines that they can become addicted to them, needing them for every task. Computers may also seem like they work ninety-nine percent of the time, but they can also be very unreliable, crashing at the worst moments. Just off the top of your head, how many people do you know that use a popular messaging service or social media site? A lot I'm sure. Now multiply that number by itself for all the people they know and multiply it again and so forth. That number shows that, indeed, over a hundred million people use these. Now what are the chances that if you sent a friend a message on one of these programs that the server will be one hundred percent reliable and your pal receives the information he needs? My point is that, what if something important came up that required your friends help, and you could not reach him because of a fault in the system? What would happen? You could be at a hospital waiting for a ride home for an hour longer than it should have taken, causing unnecessary stress. Another problem is what if you needed a computer, and you specially needed him/her? If they did have one then you have you did it in five minutes but how else could you contact them? You could try to call, but what if they are outside and are playing with his/her dog and don't hear the phone? Also these days if you are really grateful for something you go on google and type in virtual thank you cards. If the person gets it then they will be happy, but probably much more so if in the mail they got a handmade real thank you card, which shows more personal effort. My final reason that computers hurt us more than they help is addiction. Like I said in my first paragraph, everywhere you go you see somebody wired into an electronic device. People no longer go outside and play cowboys and Indians because now all they have to do is hit play on a video game. I will admit I too use my computer quite a bit but at least I budget my time so I can also go outside and play a while, which is healthier. Obesity also branches from overuse of electronics along with many other health products, making this a serious societal issue that needs addressing.
1620	1624	1	3	"Dear Members of the Community Council, Did you know that computers have been around since the mid-twentieth century? Ever since then, many people have had a better life thanks to the convenience they offer. Computers really help the elderly out a lot. When they need to pay a bill, they could just log in, pay it and move on, saving a trip to the post office. Another thing is if they need to write a letter, but their handwriting isn't that eligible anymore, they could type it, print it, and be done, ensuring clarity. This way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter without difficulty. Computers are a fad that will never die out because of their utility. Doctor Smith of the Children's Institute in New York said, ""The children I work with use computers everyday to build their hand to eye skills, ever since they have increased that skill by thirty percent."" The corporate office from a major tech company said that nine out of ten people agree that everyone should have a computer for daily tasks. Computer help you out with projects and I think everyone should have one too for research and creativity. Are you ever sitting home with nothing to do? Well, why don't you go out and buy a computer to play with? Computers can help you do all types of things for entertainment and learning. If you like to play video games, then you'll love one of these machines. They have all types of game systems out there just for computers, offering endless variety. They also have web sites you could go on just to play them for free. I'm sure most of you like to play games, so why not try it on a computer for a new experience. A basic computer isn't that much if your worried about the money, making it an accessible tool. So go out and buy one to see the benefits. There is a lot of people in college now and mostly all of them have computers for their studies. They make research easier and faster to find, which is crucial for academic success. Which would you rather do: get ready, jump in the car, drive to the library, search for a book, stand in line, and check it out, or, get on the computer, search what your looking for and be done in minutes? You make that decision based on efficiency. When college students get stressed which happens all the time, they could turn on music from the computer to calm them down, providing a quick relief. Computers have changed the world in a good way, and they continue to evolve and improve our lives. You should buy a computer today to experience these advantages for yourself and your family."
1621	1625	1	3	I believe that computer technology has a positive effect on people. I think this because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and talk to people online. Here are some reasons why. My first reason is because the computer can teach you how to type faster. For example, for the use of your fast writing you can get a good job or career and can have a future in your life, as many professions now require efficient computer use. Another example is because you can type e-mails faster and don't need to type slow, saving valuable time during your day. Last example is that you can improve your typing skills and become a better typer through consistent practice and online tutorials. My second reason is because you can learn about far away places. For example, you can learn about other countries and how it's different from our country and how they're alike, exploring diverse cultures and traditions. Another example is you can use it for projects, get all your information and be prepared for a great project, ensuring your work is well-researched and accurate. Last example is you can always learn something everyday from your computer, like news, weather etc., keeping you informed about current events around the globe. My third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people. For example, you can talk to your friends and family to check in on them and see how they're doing, maintaining close relationships over long distances. Another example is when you're bored you can always talk to someone on the computer and have fun with it, playing games or sharing stories. Last example is you can talk to your friends and plan when to hang out and go outside and get fresh air, that way you don't have to be in your house all day. That's why I think that computer technology is a good idea because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and allows you to talk to people online. I hope you agree with me also, and should think that computer technology is a good idea for everyday for lots of reasons.
1622	1626	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have come very far with technology. Computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther. But the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society. My reasons for this are when you are on a computer you could be cyber bullied. My next reason is that when you stay on too long you miss out on stuff like being with family. The last reason why computers do not benefit society is when you type on a computer the spell check on @CAPS3 checks spelling and punctuation and grammar so you don't learn from your mistakes. These reasons support me in saying computers haven't really benefited society. Firstly, my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is you can get cyberbullied. For instance somebody goes home and checks their email. They get threatening emails. They are scared what do they do. Cyber bullying, being induced by computers, is the easiest way to bully somebody. You can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message. All you really have to do is find out somebody's email. Also cyber bullying could be anybody. Someone you know or someone you don't. Computers haven't helped in society by inducing more crimes. Next my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life. Between checking email accounts and updating @CAPS4 the average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer. People who spend that much time on the computer miss things. My sister always comes out asking questions in the middle of the conversation because she's following and updating on @CAPS4 while @CAPS2 are having a conversation. People miss things while on the computer, like important family moments or conversations. Lastly, when you are typing an essay or something you don't learn anything about grammar or spelling because spellcheck checks it for you. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1 when texting don't use proper grammar or spelling. So they can write an essay in text language and when typing it over students choose what they mean from spellcheck and move on. This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling. This is reducing students thinking levels just above read and click the answer. If computers did everything for us @CAPS2 would be mindless slugs quick. In conclusion I think computers have not benefited society. Computers inducing cyberbullying. When you type spellcheck corrects your mistakes so you don't learn and people miss stuff when on the computer. Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more. Computers should be used less.
1623	1627	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think using a computer has become bad influence on modern society. When people talk to each other via text message or e-mail there is no emotional sense. You are blind a way because you can't see who's on the other side of the screen, @CAPS1 you know is the username of that person. Its practically the same as using a disguise, hiding one's true identity and intentions. Not only is the computer bad for your healthy. Its become a threat to its user. Would you really want to use something that bad toward your health and your privacy? Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of teenagers have access to and use the internet more than three times a week. Statistics also show that more than half of teenagers in the @CAPS2.S.A spend more than @NUM1 hours on a computers, some even @NUM2 hours! This has become the addiction of the world. My friend barely used a computer and always played outside. When his sister showed him @CAPS3, @CAPS4, myspace, @CAPS5, etc. He would stay on for hours and after a month, it didn't get better, day after day he began to come outside less and less, and I began to hate him for that. Statistics show that people who are using computers excessively tend to have drop in their grades. People are mixed in to these machines they become anti-social, don't do homework, potentially fail the unit and repeat the grade. Computers are the same as watching tv, sure! they teach hand to eye coordination but at the same time their brains are being turned into swiss cheese, lacking critical thinking and deep knowledge. I believe computers are the best idea, since pouring gasoline on pancakes.
1624	1628	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye coordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye coordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye coordination, which is useful for many activities. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need quickly and efficiently. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great options, showing you hotels and attractions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can go to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him, and I would feel much more isolated. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye coordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you.
1625	1629	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I am writing this letter to explain to you how more people in our society would benefit from using computer you can do work in less time it would take to do it manually. You can interact and make more friends by talking or web chatting. Not to forget that it is more entertaining. That is what computers were made for. To help us with tasks or for our personal use. How do computers though help us with work? Lets say that you are having a business meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs. It would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer. With a computer, you can type you work which makes it much neater and looks more professional, You can copy and paste your images that you can @CAPS1 on the internet. With graph making software, you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest, creating a perfect chart. If you had to do this by hand, you would have to write extremely neat, @CAPS1 pictures in a newspaper or maybe, even draw them. Then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up. It makes it twice as hard, to do a simple task with a computer. What if you want to talk to a friend? With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen. Instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them. If you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go. Being able to see the person at your convenience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have. The benefit are major and it doesn't cost anything to chat. If you have a friend or relative that lives very far away, you can easily go at talk and have a video conference, making the world feel smaller. What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable tool but we can have fun, we can play games or watch videos at our convenience. They don't cost a lot to download at all, they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself. Videos you can watch all the time with no ads to interrupt you can pause the video too. This is more efficient, they are very convenient for the average person. Playing games were ever you go is good and again don't art to play or. In conclusion I think that people would benefit more from using computers this is because it is easier to work with. We can interact with each other. Use it for entertainment. Technology was made to make things easier so we should take advantage of it.
1626	1630	1	3	"Has a computer ever helped you answer a hard question or type up an essay for school or for work? I know a computer has helped me for years, so why would I terminate it or want it gone? Here's the controversy: many experts believe computers don't benefit society, but people, such as myself, believe the exact opposite. There are many benefits to owning a computer, such as they're always a source of information, they allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic, unlike books, which are limited by what is printed. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, can share their opinions, ideas, and hard facts on a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life, he wandered the world with no hint or clue as to where to go in search of a rare artifact called the diamond. He never found the diamond, but his son, who searched for it on the internet, found out the root ""geo"" from the name meant ""underground"" in the ancient culture. Due to a computer, he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers, they would find many things that they never thought of. Also, computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones; with a computer, you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are, a computer can always be an available form of communication. For example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old you are, probably from a young age, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with work. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting, so they type their essay or letter to their boss; you can even choose what type of font it uses. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit society. Although some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addiction, I still urge you to take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of information, you can chat online, and it helps with work and school, making it an indispensable tool in our modern world."
1627	1631	1	3	"I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places, bridging distances that once kept families apart. It has lots of fun games you can play, offering entertainment for all ages. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off, bringing the world's knowledge to your fingertips. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important for maintaining close family bonds. A significant percentage of experts say that having a close-knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college and succeeding in life. I understand why some people think, ""well why doesn't the family just use the phone?"" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used, but a computer offers so much more. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play, from simple puzzles to complex adventures. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight, but isn't the real issue the hour spent sitting? It's often about eating habits and a lack of other activities. Studies show that computers are used in the winter two times as much as in summer, likely due to the weather. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to use your resources wisely. Just imagine this: a straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project of her life but forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out, looking all over the place and hyperventilating. But if you had a computer, your daughter would be able to get the project done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer, she is going to fail her class, not get accepted to Harvard, and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've given you reasons to go out and buy a computer; you just need to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with Aunt Sally who lives many miles away? Also, it is a great way to play games safely at home. And lastly, you want your daughter to go to Yale, or do you want her to fail? I have given you the facts; the rest is up to you to make the right decision for your family's future."
1628	1632	1	3	Dear committee, I do believe that computers can be positive. If you think about it, they can actually help you learn with all those different educational programs they have available. Say you need tutoring or advice on a difficult subject; you can basically find all that on a computer. Even if you have a little kid, I'm absolutely sure that they have websites and programs for them, and trust me, they're fun and educational! You know how people are complaining that computers are taking away time from exercising and interacting with family and friends? Well, what if you have family living somewhere else? You can chat with them online! And you can also find exercise routines and videos to follow while on the computer. I'm sure if you keep reading you'll know why I think they're positive. Having trouble in school? Are people blaming it on computers? Well, we can change that! If we're able to prove to people that computers can help us learn and are educationally valuable, then people might actually think that computers aren't bad. With all of this technology that we're coming up with these days, it isn't that bad. I'm pretty sure that they have some sort of tutoring program for every subject; they even have college courses online! Now there's something to look into. Do you have a kid, a younger friend, or even a younger brother and sister? Are they always looking for games to play? Well, I'm sure that they have fun learning games and websites on a computer! So, while they're having fun, you can just think of how much they're learning now! It's a real fun way of learning! You can just imagine what they're learning and how well they're doing in school because of it. Do you have family who live far away that you don't see much? Well, if you all have a computer, then you can possibly stay in touch easily! You guys can chat with each other, check up on each other, and see how everyone is doing. It's a perfect way to stay connected. Want to know what would also be a good way to connect? A webcam! You don't have to have one, it's just a suggestion. So that way, not only do you get to talk to them, but you can see them too. Isn't that cool? I don't know about you, but I think so. Well, now that you've heard what I've had to say about how I think computers are positive, I hope you think the same too. If you really think about it, they aren't bad at all. They're actually very helpful in many aspects of our daily lives, from education to family connection.
1629	1633	1	3	Dear Editor, I think that computers affect our country in a positive way. Three reasons why I think so are communication, news, entertainment, and jobs. One of my favorite things to do is talk, and when one of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number, I thought we had no way of doing it. One day he requested me on Facebook, and from there on we have been communicating on websites like Facebook, Myspace, and Skype, which has kept our friendship strong. My second reason why computers benefit our society is news. At my dad's house I do not have a television, so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world. A website was the first to announce a major celebrity's death before anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break first on the internet, making it a vital news source. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, and communicate with friends, all from one device. The last reason why computers benefit our society is jobs. Many jobs in our community require computer skills, such as an accountant, a manager, a software designer, and a computer programmer. The computer makes jobs and work more efficient by correcting mistakes, providing a visual aid, and allowing for fast typing. These are the compelling reasons why computers affect our community in a positive way, enhancing how we connect, stay informed, enjoy ourselves, and earn a living.
1630	1634	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper Editor, there is great concern about computers and whether or not people spend too much time sitting in front of the screen. I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are on the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes, you should be exercising, enjoying nature, and being with family and friends. Exercising is a major part of every person's life, and if you don't get enough of it, you could become obese. Obesity can cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don't care what others think, in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way. Exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance, get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny day, go for a walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny dots of colors forming an image of nature. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant in person? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn't you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would, and I think most other people would as well. A large percentage of the population said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, experiencing nature, and interacting with people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life, and we should strive for a healthier balance.
1631	1635	1	3	Computers are today a common household item and some people think it's bad for society when in reality it's our most useful tool nowadays. It supplies an easy access to information along with preparing skills for future generations, and giving relief from life's sometimes too cruel days through gaming. Before computers, the world spent hours in books to find what they were looking for. The computer solves this. This is known as simple as typing what you need to know and hitting the enter key. This improves grades for children and life for adults, solving an issue without leaving your home and allowing news like yourself to spread at the moment it's known. It also creates an interactive place for anyone in the world with things like forums and question and answer sites; this allows us not only to ask opinions and compare responses but to get statistics that help us make life-altering decisions. Not only does it supply info, it also prepares our youth for the world. With things like educational software, children around the world can improve social and decision-making skills. It also teaches them skills like web and graphic design as well as simpler things like file management and tougher things like business planning. Along with all that, though, it gives love and comfort. Online video gaming is today a huge market which allows people not only to explore new worlds as they do anything from dance, build, fight, smith, tailor, and so on. And this, in fact, a majority of games are for all ages. It also improves at the same time hand-eye coordination. So when you have a rough day, gaming tends to bring people happiness. So computers are a necessity and put your mind to hard work but they can help you achieve your dreams with a little well-placed effort and limits.
1632	1636	1	3	It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets people talk to friends and family around the world and also computers teach people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive effect on people. Students, whether it be at college or elementary schools, almost always go to a computer when they have to do projects for their classes; without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and it could cause them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades getting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget scheduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not have enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Every person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the world that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste a lot of money. However, with computers people can talk to friends and relatives from around the world without having to spend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and family members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member or somewhere around where a relative lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at an early age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very useful to people when they are trying to learn how to do something whether its for school, college or a job; computers are often used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future so we won't need any extra help trying to learn how to do something. Also we would be able to help people when they needed help if we already knew what to do. As you can see computers do have a positive effect on people because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from around the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are important to themselves or others.
1633	1637	1	3	To the school board, Computers are a benefit to our society. These computers are an advantage to our learning and knowledge. By using computers students can get their work done quicker and more efficient. While typing your report on the computer you might spell a word wrong; well every computer has spell check. Also you might need to look up a word because you don't know the definition; all you have to do is go to a dictionary website and type in the word and automatically you have the definition. You might have been given a book report so you can go online and copy and paste, though teachers do not want you to, but if you had a piece of paper and your pen you could write it down. A computer has made the life of a school student so much easier. You might need a job but can't stand, walk, or talk well; you could get a job working on a computer. Computers allowed more jobs to be made and replaced. Without a computer how would teachers get mail sent to them without wasting paper? Sure a computer uses electricity but paper wastes trees. Anyway you think about it, the computer is a good thing to invest in. Going to college, not everyone has enough time in a day to drive to school, well with your computer you can go to school right online. So if you don't have money to buy a back pack you don't need one; your materials stay right where you left them. So a computer is a good invention. It has made life quicker, eco friendly and even has saved trees. On the brightside it has even produced many jobs. Last minute things can even be done online. Each computer bought has given someone else a new opportunity.
1634	1638	1	3	"I believe that computers are helpful, and useful to us. They provide us with a wealth of entertainment, enable us to communicate with one another, and even help us learn. Today, if it's raining outside, or its too cold to do anything, you can go on to the computer, you can watch movies, play games, and webchat. The computer is a great machine, and health experts say ""computer usage is fine so long as it's limited to about an hour or hour and a half a day"". Some people complain that people aren't getting enough exercise because of computers. But its not really the computers fault that they aren't exercising. In todays modern world, you can call someone, text someone, or page them; with computers though, you can do even more, with a webcam, you can video chat with people, and send each other videos. You can also connect with your friends on facebook or myspace. Sociologists say that more and more people are connecting to social websites, and talking with their friends. ""Social websites are great,"" one also said, ""they enable you to talk with your friends when they're far away, or you just can't see them. However, nothing beats real connection."" Computers also help us learn. They can answer almost any question you have, and have information on a lot. Today, most people don't rely solely on books. Some people still might think that computers are bad for you, and they cause lack of exercise, but I believe people have the choice to make friends. They choose to over use the computer, and too much of any thing is a bad thing. Computers today are an invaluable part of life, and are irreplaceable."
1635	1639	1	3	Dear Editor, As you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other. If someone doesn't have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world as well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on a search engine and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also comes in handy when you have nothing to do. If you're bored and can't play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, as well as keep you busy. If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained, you can go on music sites or other sites and find any song you want to hear. It's better than listening to the radio because sometimes you don't like the song that's playing. If you're also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document or if you just want to type whats on your mind. As you can see, I think the computer is a fascinating tool to use. You can communicate, learn new things, and keep yourself entertained if you're not able to do something active. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family.
1636	1640	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people own either computers or laptops. They both do the same things and are essentially famminal devices. They can help you do a lot of things that others @MONTH1 not be able to do. These electronics @MONTH1 help you find a long lost sibling or whom ever you @MONTH1 want to find. Computers @MONTH1 also get you hurt or @CAPS4 if you buy online, so be careful. ""I went to find my brother I left when I was at my mother's house,"" cried the woman. That is a job for a computer. @CAPS3 websites accessible through a computer @MONTH1 help you do this, such as facebook, myspace and others. This can effect yours and @CAPS3 mores. This can turn your life around inna heartbeat. It can make what may seem a hard time into a good one just by finding your loved one. Computers come with @CAPS3 risk. You can try to pay your bills online and accidentally send your money to the wrong websites. That can get your identity stolen. You can also put all your information online and you @MONTH1 not think a lot of it, but people really do pay attention. You can put your phone number, address and many more details and people @MONTH1 contact you, act like someone else, and @MONTH1 you or even kill you. @CAPS3 people thinks it very safe but it isn't, @CAPS4 watch out what yo do. The computer is a big problem on why the economy is @CAPS4; @CAPS3 people don't like to go out to buy stuff anymore, they rather just go on the computer and shop. That is one reason why you begun to be way too isolated. You @MONTH1 go out, or you @MONTH1 just stay home and just play games online. @CAPS4, @CAPS3 more American, on your computer you do both work and just be lazy. At the end of everything, it's your choice; computers are a useful @CAPS4, so do the pros and not the cons."
1637	1641	1	3	People think the computer is something good and cool. Why is it cool? It is cool because the computer helps you in everything. I have several reasons. The first reason is when in your school you have homework, work, a project or something like that, the computer helps you a lot. Because on the computer you can sign into the internet and you go to google or other web sites for information. The second reason is the computer helps you in your house; for example, you have a big problem with your car or something like that. You can go on the computer in @LOCATION1 and then you see the pieces of your car or find a repair guide. The third reason the computer is so cool is because in this time you can make everything happen. We can go on the web and facilitate our life. Now you can realize your work, homework, projects, ideas, write a book, chat, find information, print pictures, and etc... And if you are an architect you can make your proper work or design a house; you see the computer is so cool. But some people use the computer for bad things, for example for pornography or something bad; this is not cool and is not appropriate for people. The computer is something fabulous and super genius. My opinion is that the computer helps a lot; it is something like a need in our life. Not for living, but for our daily life or something @CAPS1. Sometimes you can see your family through a webcam. This is fabulous but don't use the webcam for something bad; you can learn things that you didn't know. I think that for this reason you should use the computer for good things. Appraise the computer. Please use it wisely and for positive purposes.
1638	1642	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Technology is an important part of everyday living; even some people's lifestyle without technology, more specifically, computers, mankind would be lost. We wouldn't be able to learn about faraway places and people, research things with a wider range of information available, or for some people, talk to friends and family. Technology is needed in everyone's life, whether they realize this or not. There is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer, and as far as advances in technology, this is only the beginning. The internet allows people to learn—and more than just what you would get from a book at the library. You can learn about the culture of @LOCATION1, the food they eat in @LOCATION2, or even the way people dress in @LOCATION3. You can find pictures of faraway places and find out the currency of a country. The possibilities a @CAPS1 computer allows you to do is research, which makes giving a presentation much easier! Furthermore, the computer enables people to communicate with others. For some, this is their only way of communication. If you have a penpal in another state, or maybe even another country, e-mail is a great way to talk to them; it's a quick, easy, and enjoyable tool. Others, however, prefer instant messaging, where the message you type pops up almost instantly on the other's computer. Then they type a response and it comes back to you! Either method is a great way of communication! So you see, without technology we would not be able to learn everything we'd like to, research for a school project, or even communicate with some others. And this is only the beginning of what our lives would be like without the computer, showing how integral it has become.
1639	1643	1	3	To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping, and even entertainment. Sounds great, right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over people's lives and keeping them from exercising. Nowadays, people are even losing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics; they have much upkeep which costs you money, ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you haven't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people exercising. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing Grand Theft Auto or Facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the population in @LOCATION1 goes without physical activity for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people would rather just stay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reasons that computers are bad, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you can do everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People would rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quickly; I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computers cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the upkeep and there is lots of upkeep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to lose a report you've worked on all night. For example, last @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it, and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. That's all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth the trouble and expense.
1640	1644	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe computers can be bad for society. My reasons being people are spending too much time on their computers, less time exercising, and losing interaction with family and friends. My first reason why I think computers are bad for our society is people are spending too much time on them. I know when I get home from school the computer is all I can think about until I go on. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social network rather than going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. I've been over a friend's house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. A lot of @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. I've seen my little brother spend his whole Saturday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It's just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends; I've spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's like when you're on the computer nothing else matters because you think ""hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or Myspace, or Facebook!"" You lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with your family because you barely talk to them while you're on the computer. Half the time I'm too busy talking to someone I don't know than helping my little brother with homework, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion, these are my three reasons why I think the computer is bad for civilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think about what the computer can do to @CAPS1 people. Once again, those three reasons are: one, people are spending too much time on their computer; two, they spend less time exercising; and three, they lose interactions with family and friends, which harms our social fabric."
1641	1645	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @DATE1, computers are a big part of our society. They are an advance in technology, and they have some positive effects. However, computers have more negative effects on people. They take away and diminish @CAPS3 time, interacting with family, and seeing the world. First, computers have a negative effect on people because they diminish @CAPS3 time. People are so caught up with computers, their desire for @CAPS3 starts to fall. According to a @ORGANIZATION3 survey in @DATE2, for @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer a week (roughly @NUM2 hours each day) had an increase in cholesterol and slowly deterioating muscles. ""Computers distract people from their needs"" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people get this amount."" The leading cause for this low number? ""technology,"" she says, ""@CAPS2 computers, which take away all of the motivation and time people need to @CAPS3."" @CAPS3 is vital, and computers are taking this away from society. People shouldn't have bad @ORGANIZATION1 because of this negative effect: computers. Second, computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family. @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people say that computers take away from their family time, reports Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. This is not of all good, especially since @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to eat up time, it also cuts of communication, something extremeley important in graving children. with this, family bonds and relationship are ruined as wal. It affects interacting with family, and puts hates in family bonds: computers haved negative effect on people. Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world. When you're on the computer, it seems like the entire world is in your computer screen. But its not. This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notedly become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net. The cure? Traveling, or even talking walks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of their world in which they live. They have to make important descions for themselves, their children, even their country, and staring at a computer screen wont help at all. It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, it takes away from people seeing the world, something actually very important because it affects people's desicion making as well as future generations. People need to realize these bad effects, and majorly decrease their computer usage."
1642	1646	1	3	Computers have alot of impact on peoples life! Computers can be helpful and distracting at the same time. I have a computer, but I can only go on if after I finish my homework. I do alot of things on my computer mostly games and social websites like myspce. Computers can be helpful by helping you with homework or find information. I use my computer for homework alot like for project or if i dont know what the subject is about. I also think the computers are helpful by talking to friends or family. I talk to my family alot and they live all the way in @LOCATION1. I go on myspace like five times a week. Computers can also be a distration by making people lazy and have bad websites. Like myspace can be dangerous. If you tell someone all your important information and you don't know them. That can turn out very bad. Alot of people dont even get off the computer. I have alot of family members that only get up to go on the computer or play video games. They don't get off too. There on like for eight hours. My mom also uses the computer to go on @CAPS1. She talks to alot of her friends that she left in @LOCATION1. She still talks to the people in high school, but she mostly talks to her older sister. She's not on the computer for @NUM1. She's on like for @NUM2 minutes to an hour. I think computers can help in life, but not to be on for like eight hours. You'll see what you will turn if you do that every. My cousins are getting bigger and bigger. I don't mean height. So if you do go on the computer not for almost half the day! It is important to use computers wisely and not let them take over your life.
1643	1647	1	3	Dear newspaper, Technology is a very useful thing But is also a bad thing, it makes people lazy on . A computer is a multi-use tool. Along with this people cango on any website . Anything, as in research or personal reasons. First off, let me point out that computers are useful multi-purpose tools. Computers can also, @CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people. A lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end. Students sometimes go home and strayht oor tug computer instead of doing homework. Moreover, computers can help you pay bills. Do research, or maybe just for fun play games. There is an ulimeted number of websites & to cp on through to hep you with many of needs. Uploading family pictures from your last vacation? its simple with most computer soft . Finally, computers is kind of like one . They can even become a blank just waiting for a pinest of insparation. So, while computers are powerful tools, we must be careful not to let them make us inactive.
1644	1648	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer-time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer-time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself. They are wonderful tools when used responsibly."
1645	1649	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers tend to have more negative effects on people, rather than positive. This is true because people @MONTH1 not be getting enough exercise, people @MONTH1 not be enjoying nature to the forest, and lastly, because in this world, people do not spend enough time with family and friends. Computer are good to have around the house, but. To begin, people are spending too much time on computers. They are having more of a negative effect because while on the computer, you are not getting excercise. Think about the a day doing fat because of all the fast food on the computer while eating it. Obeseity now a days is a big concern with the @ORGANIZATION1. Staying on the computer does not help the situation. Any concerned person, technologically challenged would agree the countless ones on the computer are no good for the health of our country. Further more, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough beauty of nature. Many people, adults and have @DATE1 because they are world but there that should be explored and people should be thankful for beautiful that we have still @DATE1. They should be things wait to see it. Although communication is important for everyone, instead of talking on the computer, people should make plans with their family and friends. This idea also relates back to the lack of exercise and naivety of people. If people were to go out and enjoy life to the forest with their friends and family, there wouldn't be numerous hours a day wasted on a computer. People should get off their butts and go. Life is too short to sit around all day. Any intelligent person would realize that computer time isn't as fun as family and friend time. To conclude, computers are and have been very over-used recently. Instead of having problems, lack of sun, and just boring computer talk, people should got up and go. We only live once, and that once should be lived to the fulest! We should embrace the real world around us.
1646	1650	1	3	Dear local newspaper, what would a person do without a computer? Well, I think nothing because, what if you are like me and have your family far away in another country? Well, with a computer you can see them through a camera and talk to them just like if you were there. Computers just don't take your time; they help you understand the meaning of a family. There are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know about their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have too much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their opportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in an office need information about a place where a disaster happened. You might need something to see how it happened and what the condition was when it happened. People that work in an important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important; it helps you keep a job or have everything on hand. Well, computers are not just a pass of time; they also make your life easier. Many people say that they don't want to have too many papers; with a computer you can have all those papers in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you can see, many people that have computers use them in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many things for your own future, not just to play around with some new friends. Well, as you can see, these are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way.
1647	1651	1	3	Dear local newspaper, a computer is a very helpful resource. It helps people navigate through life; they can find jobs and do research for school. This world would be nothing without computers. But on the other hand, some people do spend too much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in their research topic and voilà, tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your fingertips. Also, a computer can help unemployed people find a job. It's easy; type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay-at-home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also, working from home can be a lot less stressful. It's less stressful because you don't have to deal with annoying and impatient coworkers. Did you know that a significant percentage of employment is from the workers' home? Now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office just another day at home. Computers have helped us come a long way since caveman times. Without computers, this world would be nothing. We wouldn't have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even blenders. We also wouldn't have the more sophisticated things like rockets, and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers; where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardies? On paper? Where would the government store their information? On paper? With those three places we already cut down half of the forest. Computers help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on another planet or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Let's recap: they help students research, help people find jobs, you can work from home, and they help the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like cavemen. The bottom line is that computers are very helpful.
1648	1652	1	3	Dear local newspaper, having computers is a good idea because every developed country uses computers. Also, they facilitate learning, fertilize communication, and are commercially important. Computers also make life easier for many people. Computers facilitate learning by letting vast amounts of information be available. I personally find out about many world events just by bringing up yahoo.com. Computers allow me to learn about new things; learning about cultures all over the world can be done by computers. The last way computers facilitate learning is by informing us about everyday things like how to get a stain out, how to pronounce a word, how to make a new dish, and much more. Computers are also crucial to communication. We use computers to talk to our friends on Facebook. You can also meet new people using a PC. Everyone uses computers so you can basically meet anyone. The last reason computers are important is for the commercial standpoint; computers help a lot of small businesses out by letting them be known. Domestic sellers and huge companies can compete for the same customer. Furthermore, the internet generates a lot of money for people because they can use it as a cyber billboard. In conclusion, the computer is useful because of learning, communication, and commerce. Therefore, the computer should be supported and not looked down upon.
1649	1653	1	3	"Dear Editor, have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer? Computers have a negative effect on people! You could be damaging your sight, time should be spent playing outside, and it'll make it harder to talk to people in person. Do your eyes tend to hurt when you're finally off the computer? Whether you are playing games or typing articles, your eyes can strain to keep up with a small font on a website. I remember the time when I read an online novel and my whole body was ready to go and play, except for my eyes. Instead of playing sports games on the computer you should get up and play one outside! When you're on a computer, you're most likely indoors. Did you know a person should be outside for at least a certain number of minutes to get their vitamin D? You're not sustaining the right amount of vitamins you need daily at a computer screen. Do you ever find it easier to talk to someone on the computer than it is in person? You're not the only person that thinks that way. If you get off of the computer and talk to someone face to face you can improve your social skills. At first it won't be easy but it's worth it in the long run. By now you know that computers aren't really giving off a positive effect. They're hurting your vision, limiting your outdoor activity time, and making it harder to talk to people in person. So come on, put the mouse down and find something ""hands on"" to do!"
1650	1654	1	3	Computers do not benefit society today. Computers have made technology a necessity, many people don't spend enough time doing other activities, and they do not benefit your health. Do you want a world full of people who have their eyes glued to a computer screen? Computers are very helpful to all people but they are addicting. Computers were made to get your tasks done quicker and easier. For example, you can shop online and google things. We live in a generation where computers have become a necessity instead of a pleasure. According to a psychologist, more than a certain percentage of people, now-a-days, are inside on their computers. Furthermore, computers are making people lazier. Instead of going to the store to buy things or walking to your friend's house to talk, you would typically use the computer to do so. Therefore, people don't spend enough time doing other things. For example, on a sunny and beautiful day you would think that most kids would be outside having fun, but this isn't the case anymore. For children who are old enough to use a computer, they will be inside on that nice day. There are many nice things to do on a computer, like chatting with friends, checking your e-mails, and Facebook. Even though these things are pleasurable, you should limit your time on the computer. Most of the time that you spend on the computer could be spent outside or at the movies. Not being on the computer could help small businesses too. If you pay money to do an activity, or buy something, it would make a difference in the small business's profits. On the other hand, computers don't benefit your health. A magazine says that there are health risks when you use your computer all the time. A percentage of people become obese and have vitamin D deficiency from using their computers so much. When using your computer you could be working out or exercising, and this causes obesity. Also, if you are inside all the time, you won't get the healthy amount of sunlight that you need, thus you have a vitamin D deficiency. Another health risk is having bad eyes. If you spend hours a day on a computer your eyes can get permanently damaged. Do you want your child to be put at risk for using a computer too much? In conclusion, it is safe to say that computers do not benefit society today. Many people have an addiction to technology, you could be using your time more wisely, and computers put your health at risk. Although computers do allow us to have an easier time accomplishing tasks, abusing the privilege will have consequences on everyone.
1651	1655	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise, or even spending time with family. Some parents are less active with their kids, choosing to stay indoors. Kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home, distracted by games and social media. Adults and kids are getting less excersize. Sitting down reading or what ever they do on the computer is not excersizeing. They are going to get fat because they eat and sit down and than they get hungery again than eat and sit down, creating a cycle of inactivity. Some people say that your getting finger and arm exsersize by and moveing the mouse, thats not really true. Looking at the computer screen all day can cause masive hand and eye strain. People are also not spending time with family. They are sitting infront or a computer and ignoring everyone and everything around them. Kids could be enjoying other things besides computers, like sports or reading. Parents could be outside, playing catch with their kids or even playing a board game with them. People are not less active. They are not going out and haveing fun jumping around with their friends. Instead they aim them on computers or message them on facebook or even myspace. Kids are failing in school because they fail to do their home work after school. They would rather go on the computer for entertainment. This is why i think computers have an positive effect on kids and adults, leading to a less healthy and connected lifestyle.
1652	1656	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 In my opinion the computer is the better thing because you can do alot of stuff like play games and research topics. My three reason why you should have a computer is you can talk online with your friend or do homework or project and fine out @LOCATION1 things out. Therefore I think if you like doing that then the computer is what you need. My first reason is talking online. People talk online so they can talk to there friend @PERSON1 quickly and easily. If you talk oline you can figure out what was homework or whens the meeting or the time the party starts. You can also talk online with your friends or family the moved or lives far away around @LOCATION2, which helps you stay connected. My second reason is doing homework. Sometimes you need the computer to do your homework properly. You need the computer so you can print picture for your report or find images. You wil also need to type yout report on your vaction, making it look neat. The computer also help you fine the history or @CAPS2 book online so you can do your homework or project accurately. My third reason is finding out @LOCATION1 things. You fine out how old is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or how tall is @ORGANIZATION1 using a search engine. You can also figure out how to spell a big word you don't know. You can fine out many hallway can take you to @LOCATION1 or @CAPS5 beach or other places for directions. Fine out where the wall of @LOCATION3 is located. In coulsion if you like to learn @LOCATION1 thing or talk online and do other stuff then you should get a computer for your home.
1653	1657	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I believe it is true many people use computers and that many more will use them in the future. Computers are a standard of the buissnes world and are hevily depended on for daily operations. People are even needing internet access on cellphones to stay up to date on stocks, shipments and important emails from anywhere. Some computers are also just for at home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @MONTH1 need instantly or wouldn't be able to find any were else. Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use but then does not mean they will permanently restrict you from othere activeties like sports. It is true some people do spend to much time on computer but not everyone does, some people work from home computer and can not help being on it because it is their job and income. I implore you to consider the resonse computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help not hurt people in their tasks. Computers are very helpfull in simplying things and are very useful for information gathering. I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect hte way of human life. Computers do th things people would normaly not do for example someone would not go and look up every thing he or she needs to know in a look because there be only certain facts there looking for and it would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several diferent books for hours. So if you truly think about it computers save us a tremendus amount of time with the things we do every day. Once again I say ""computers better owe life not hurt it"" by making tasks easier."
1654	1658	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper,Ö I believe that computers have a negitive affect on people today. I believe this because computers cause people to be less active, most people would want to be at home on their computers then out side doing activities like playing sports. I also belive computers restrict people who talk through it to show emotion properly. People should be out with each other when they talk not talking throught a machien that limits expression. Finally if people were not on the computer as much they would bring down the obesity rate of the contry if everyone just stoped using technology for a while and wen outside to play. Every day at least once or twice or somtimes even more people use the computer for hours on end without a break. People today have so many options of things to do on the internet: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, ooVoo, and alot more social sites. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say they ""need"" to check these everyday but they really dont need to. What they do ""need"" to do is to stop using computers as much and go out side for fresh air! Furthermore, people all around the world communicate thought the computer. I talk to my friends all the time thought the computer"" says @PERSON1, ""@CAPS3 the easiest way"". Now it @MONTH1 be the easiest way but @CAPS3 also the most boring, I mean really do you want to talk like a robot or with emotion like a person face to face? Computers dont give you the chance to show emotion, this means people need to go out, hans out, and mabye even call each other to talk with feeling. At least you getting up to get the phone and moving. Finally, @CAPS4 is one of the most obese places in the whole world partly due to inactivity. People are sitting on the computer everyday, eating snacks, and not moving at all and gaining weight over time. Do you really want to be a known as the ""fat country""? I dont think so, it is a bad label. People should restrict computer usage among themselves to a of an hour even less if you can manage it. To restate, I beleve that computers have a negitive affect on todays people aroung the world. Computers cause people to be less active, less emotionn in a conversation, and cause people to be obese from sitting. So please help me fight to put more people outside and make people more active, sounds like a pretty good cause huh for health?"
1655	1659	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am here to talk about my view on computers, about how they help people, and how many people say that kids and adults are spending to much time on them. My first views on this subject is that computers are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on, offering new features. These past few years, computer company's have been making enormous strides allowing people to do allmost everything from home. This is both good and bad for society. A computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home or office. It is great for people who own a small business, you can easily go online and update somthing yoou want changed in your store, such as designing colorful posters to put on the windows of your store to increase business and to catch peoples eye as they pass. You are also able to book flights weeks or even months before you even go to the airfort, saving time. This is good for those who are busy and travel a lot for work. You can go on a website called @ORGANIZATION2 where you can go anywhere vin the world and zoom in on a landmark such as the great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1 from your chair. Computers can also improve your hand eye coordination when you type on the keyboard. Typing is a important skill to master, if you are a good typer you can do things much more efficient then you would on paper with a pen. Some can even memorize the key board and not have to even look down while typing. Computers are also great for communication if you have relatives far away in another state or even country you can easily talk to them through @CAPS4 for free. @CAPS4 is a online service that you use to talk to them in person with video. These are just some of the things you can do with computer today. On the other hand many say that people are spending to much time on computers, and getting outside for execise and not spending enough time with family in person. I do agree this is the case in some ways and can be a problem. I know some friends who average about six hours a day on computers which to me is to much time, also parents become to busy with work that they are on computers, when they should be spending time with their kids playing. Some kids became so addicted to computers that they might become unhealthy and become obease from sitting so much, this is something that should not happen to children. I hope you have learned a little bit about the good and the bad about computers, and how it is important not to be on the computer to much, but it can be an important feature if used correctly for work and learning.
1656	1660	1	3	Hello everyone, I have heard how many people are basically saying that computers are bad. That people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time outside and being with family. But I'm writing you today to tell you about how great computers really are. First off, computers help technology so much. People can now do things that we could never do before. Things like chatting to people across the sea without having to pay for a phone call or even be there. Looking up ways to burn fat fast and diet programs. Uploading photos to share with other family and friends. And much, much more. Computers have helped so many people do so many things! Mostly good things by the way. Secondly, computers have helped us accomplish things that otherwise we couldn't have gotten done. Like go to the moon! Have cellphones! And some diseases were helped cured by using computers for research and simulations. Computers can be a little dangerous to some people, who probably don't know how to use them right, but in a few more years all that can be fixed! We are getting more and more advanced in so many ways, it's kinda crazy! I could go on and on, on so many more things that computers do for us, but there are not enough pages. Lastly, it is more easier to do research with computers. -And quicker to- For example, in my school we use our computers for learning purposes, and they help us very much. I've personally, learned a lot from computers. I even use them to get better at math for the state test! We need them! (I do at least) I'm even starting to learn another language with them. It's not to assume that every one who uses them are fat, lazy, and don't spend enough time with family and/or friends. Furthermore, please stop all of this nonsense, I really don't think that spending too much time on computers is the thing that you should be worrying about right now. That is all I have to say. Bye.
1657	1661	1	3	I remember when computers weren't so popular. Back then I had to write my essays by hand and listen to music on the radio. Now computers are very popular. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people today because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to access them. You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, projects etc. Which is good because its much easier and looks more professional. For example I'm a student that can't draw so I printed some pictures from the computer so I can paste them on my poster board. So in other words the computer is useful for students. I know many colleges expect students to turn in their assignments through the computers or its a zero. In this society there's no time for zeros because when you are in college you're still paying for the class even if you're failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of interesting because you can catch up with friends that you haven't seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantages because you would have never thought you will see what your old friend is doing. Another thing about computers is that you can find stuff cheaper than in everyday life. Say if you want to take a trip and you call the airline for your ticket. The ticket came up to a high price. But you go on the computer and you go on the airline's website and find your ticket to Florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a recession we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convenience. At home if my laptop is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what to do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to access one! In this generation everybody is rushing and computers help us keep up.
1658	1662	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are effecting more and more people in the society instead of helping. A boy named, John started to have many health problems after he had bought a computer. The computer that he thought was helping him wasn’t any help at all. His health issues started to get worse. He soon started to be out of breath more, always have a high blood pressure and he started to become overweight. Since he had this computer he didn't exercise or got out to spend time with his family and friends as much as he was on the internet. Computers aren't helpful, my opinion is that all they do is waste time, lose your education and can make you unhealthy. As you may already know computer can do a lot to help you but there are some things that you don't know about computers. According to a health magazine, tests shows that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose a significant percentage of your brain cells. That's a lot of brain cells to lose when you are going to need them for your education. There is no way to get those back, either. After walking around the streets to listen to what people think about how computers can effect people, an officer, a policeman at the police department had this to say, ""I love using computer and going on the internet, but most of the time I act on the computer at night and find myself getting off very late. The internet can be very unsafe and unhealthy. Computers can help you find what your looking for or show things that you have never seen before, but it is all a waste of time. Instead of going on the computer to go on facebook, youtube, or myspace you should go outside and interact with your family and friends."" After interviewing a popular female rapper so far she had this to stay ""Computers are okay but they are sometimes just a waste of time. Instead of being on the internet doing something pointless like playing a game you could be studying for an upcoming test or doing your homework so that you wouldn't be doing it at the last minute."" We must be cautious with our computer use."
1659	1663	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, You might agree that people could use computers all the time and never get off. Well I don't. Think about all the negative things that could happen. Like spending less time with your family, getting addicted, and becoming unhealthy. People who spend all their time on the computer forget that their family is there. For instance, I remember when I was little and I was on the computer and I forgot that I had family members with me, so I missed out on all the fun things like going to the mall or park. Certainly, playing on the computer is fun but wouldn't you want to give some attention to your family. Almost a majority of people in other countries can be very lonely because all they do is play on the computer and forget about other people. You wouldn't want to be like these other people right? I never thought playing on computers could be addictive. Lots of people in other countries can't last a day without playing on computers. Some say almost all the people that play on computers all day, day to night have died because they barely eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. Imagine your life being ended because of addiction on computers. I remember when my friend told me, ""don't be on the computer to long you might die,"" and I thought it was a joke. So think about going on the computer all day and night. Last but not least, some people aren't treating their body properly. For example, some people playing on computers forget about eating, sleeping or walking around. This tends to make people's legs numb and make people's stomach hurt a lot. Imagine not eating, sleeping and walking around for a day. You wouldn't even want to try this. Now is the time to decide, whether people should be able to play on the computer day to night. Also all the negative things that can happen like spending less time with family members, getting addicted, and being unhealthy. So get right up and decide for yourself before it is too late."
1660	1664	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. There has been people saying that the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are my thoughts on the computer. First of all, the computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on the television. If you want to find the news, just go to a website that you think has news. I can find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that may be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either you're having trouble on homework, or you just want to know a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up something you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This may not seem that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can talk to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh that's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. It can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independence comes in. Get off of it. It's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go outside, enjoy nature. Maybe do a little exercise. It is all about finding a healthy balance in life."
1661	1665	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse carries over to sports like baseball and lacrosse. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact that easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. We are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-eye coordination. Computers are the world's most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try, if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a vast cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper is made from trees, so they must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computers and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would in a whole day at school. The transition needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it weren't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way to communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benefits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication, and they clearly demonstrate the positive impact of this technology on our modern world.
1662	1666	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 press, I have recently heard about many arguments based on computers ruining society. I strongly disagree with this. I think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends. The internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Some people have moved away and I haven't been able to talk to them. Now, with the internet I am able to talk again. The same case is with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she never talked to. Now, with Facebook she has re united with them. This also helps because you can email someone instead of sending a letter in the mail, which costs money, unlike email. So the internet can also be a way of saving money. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with friends and relatives. I also believe that the use of a computer is more efficient than going to a library and researching a book. If you don't have enough time to go to a library, you can do some research at your house. What if the library is closed if you do go, then you wasted some time. The internet never closes, it is open @NUM1. What if you go to the library and they are open, but do not have a book on your subject? This can also be done on the internet because there is anything you could ever ask for on the internet. If you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet. The internet is a great place to research on any topic you have or doing whatever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing about every game there is that you would feel like playing. Also, instead of spending about @MONEY1 on an x-box and a game, you @MONTH1 only have to spend about @MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer. There are also many websites that have games on them. Some websites are for specific games, and some have many games on them. Only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends. On the other hand, many games are only for one player. As a result, a computer is a great use to play games. In conclusion, I believe the computer is a great need for our society. In the long run it will pay off, especially with the economic problems our country is having now, by helping us save money, connect with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like it.
1663	1667	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Which article title is more interesting, ""Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race"" or ""Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race on computer game."" @CAPS3, the less interesting title is what your news will change to if people keep using computers. Some effects computers have on people include cheating and less time with family and friends and lastly, most people aren't learning anything while on the computer, they're just playing games. As you can see, I agree that computers are a bad idea. I bet some people have never thought of this but computers can lead kids, and maybe even adults, to cheating. There are websites on the internet where the user just types the question in, and they get an answer. There is @CAPS4 another way of cheating, copying others work, essays or articles from a website. Some students could be told to write a biography on a person, and they could just copy an article, switch some words around to make it sound like their own paper, and with no guilt. Another way computers can be bad is people spend less time with family and friends. I was watching television and saw a show about a man who was always on the computer. The wife was very upset because he spent all his time on the computer, and this caused problems. Because of this show I realized that computers can be anti-social and cause divorce rates between parents to go up. Do you see all people on computers looking up facts about things and learning? I know that when I have time to go on the computer, I am not looking up things to learn. Most people these days dont care too much about learning about countries, other than their own, or people, other than people they know. I think it's pretty obvious that no one is going on computers to learn, otherwise they wouldn't have so many users on game websites. In conclusion, computers have negative effects that get to all people. So, @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to have your news be the latest divorces and computer game high scores? Or do you want interesting news that will keep your newspaper going? Thanks for taking the time to read this."
1664	1668	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing? The computer is one of the top devices used by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little too much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend too much time on it, can't interact with friends or family and you can't enjoy nature. Don't get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercise if you are on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You can't get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead of being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, rather than to sit, is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs instead of running your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you won't have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishes will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all won't you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature and explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breath of fresh air. If you haven't visited the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. You're getting exercise & exploring nature too. While you're at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, you're buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just don't spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand and try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!
1665	1669	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and despite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has a near-infinite amount of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a computer and one without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs on and searches for the person, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the report, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on that person are checked out. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about that. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works at a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a difference a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet every day and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is dangerous and leads to problems, but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to share private information. The internet also has safety features and those still unsure can use special sites to talk to people they know in life only. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having difficulty finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site and people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writer, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to get a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ads so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a writer their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 in great detail. Problem solved and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computers provide; you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your disposal. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that computers have no limit to what you can do with them, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurt it, and they are doing a great job.
1666	1670	1	3	Do you like learning about faraway exotic lands and animals? Are you good at sports but would like to be even better? Do you ever miss your family that lives in other states? The computer can help you with all of this but is it bad for you too? In my opinion, kids and adults should use the computer. When people are on the computer they can learn about interesting far away lands. When you're on the computer you can look up some of the natural disasters. For example, people could google earthquakes and learn all about the people that have lost their lives. Then, the people that learn about it might donate some money to the poor or to children living on their own. They can also learn about all the wonderful beautiful lands that are out there waiting to be explored. Everyone I know likes to see the beautiful birds and animals. In the world, they will be able to do this on a computer. There might be so much more in these lands. Having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get ahold of. With having a computer, people will be able to talk to their family that live in other states. I have an uncle that lives in Florida. I only get to see him rarely because it costs a lot of money to come. Somewhere on the computer, it is easy to just send him a message that says how I'm doing. With a computer you will be able to talk to your friends who you can't talk to on the phone. For example, what if your friend did not have a phone? She cannot talk on the phone, so what do you do? This can help you talk to her. The last reason why we should have a computer is for hand-eye coordination. If you play video games for short periods of time then it will help you with hand eye coordination. This will help the kids that play baseball. They will know where the ball is at all times and they will most likely catch the ball more often, so playing a little bit of video games is not bad for anyone. Using the computer is good to do; not using the computer helps people be able to interact with people that are not so easy to talk to. So if you are completely against using the computer, then get up and use it right now to see its benefits.
1667	1671	1	3	"As more and more technology is being invented, people use the computer to do work and to learn. But more time on the computer is not necessarily a good thing. People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having a negative effect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise. Take my friend John for example. He was a triathlete, who trained everyday so he could be in the Ironman triathlon in Hawaii next year. But then he got his computer. John had suddenly lost interest in exercise and spent his whole day checking his e-mail instead of training. But he is not the only person who has become unhealthy because of computers. Experts say that children with computers at home get only half of the exercise children without computers get. Children with computers also were more likely to be overweight and choose chips over an apple in a study performed at the National Institute of Health. Dr. Smith, who headed this study said, ""Children are taught by society that computers can do such wonderful things and educate them. However, they are not taught how bad they can be for your health when used too much."" Clearly, computers are a problem to our health. Another reason computers are a problem is because they strain your eyes. When my school had disabled people come and talk to us last month, there was a blind lady named Mary, who lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spent too much time on her laptop. But she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers. Scientists at the Vision Lab in California said that one out of five regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One of these scientists, Dr. Evans, reported, ""As more people begin to use the computer, more people seriously hurt their eyes or even lose their vision. We estimate thirty percent of this next generation will be legally blind before age forty."" Therefore, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. A third reason people should not use computers is because they stop interacting with real people. My uncle, Robert, lives in Texas. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. That is, until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven't seen or talked to him in almost a year because he has created a new family on the computer and spends the whole day pretending he is a warrior and fighting dragons on the internet game Dragon World. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that seventy percent of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor Johnson had this to say about how this is affecting children. ""Too many children are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. They stop caring about school, sports, even their friends. It's alarming!"" What reason could you have to use a computer after learning how bad it is for you and your children! Computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity. They are extremely dangerous for our health. They cause us to stop exercising and gain weight, permanently damage our eyes, and deny us of the proper socialization that all people need to be happy and healthy. Is this what you want for yourself and generations to come?"
1668	1672	1	3	Computers are very popular these days. Many people use computers for research, jobs, shopping, homework, and more. Although some people think computers take up too much of our time and that it prevents society from interacting with friends and family, this is not entirely true. What's great about computers is that you can chat with your friends and family online or even have a video chat with them. So, you're never really avoiding your friends and family; you are connecting with them in a modern way. Another thing that is great about computers is you can research anything you need to for projects, jobs, homework, and things for school, etc. The top websites people use for resources are Wikipedia.com and NationalGeographic.com, etc. Computers are also great for typing out reports, making powerpoints for jobs and projects, and so much more! Anything you could think of is most likely found in a computer. As you can see, a computer is so helpful and is a great resource. Having a computer at home is much better than taking a trip down to the public library; it saves time and money from taking all those trips and you get your own personal library by getting a computer. You never know what new technology could bring, making life even more convenient and information more accessible for everyone.
1669	1673	1	3	Everyone will agree that using computers is also a good choice because you do meet people you don't know. Also you learn more stuff you don't know about the world. Not only that but you can also learn more about technology itself. Most people would say that meeting people online is good because you can have fun talking and getting to know new people. Also, people would want to learn about other people's cultures and traditions. Some people would want to know some personal or business information about people they meet. Even people want to know where some people are from originally. People like to know these details to build friendships and understand the world better, and computers provide a wonderful window for such discoveries and connections.
1670	1674	1	3	"Dear Members at the Medical Association, a letter to Dr. Ray, ""Computers have helped me further my medical research. I can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all my important information organized."" How can you question a leading doctor? I agree with Dr. Ray and say that computers are good use in society today. People were already becoming lazy because of television. You can't blame it on computers. With websites such as Facebook and Skype, people can keep in touch easily. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or go dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. ""My patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me know if they think something's very wrong with them,"" says Dr. Jane. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill; you can just video chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How would you feel if no one called and told you your best friend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You'd be extremely upset. I know I would be. With email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn't know how to tell you, they could email you. It's so much easier than telling a person that their mom died by calling them on the phone. To hear pain in a person's voice will make you want to cry; you feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today's society? You can't blame computers for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person wants to be lazy, then that's their decision. You shouldn't go around blaming others and things when it's no one else's fault but that person's. This is a great way to keep in contact with others. Plus, think of all the information you can learn, not just about family and friends, but the world too. Thank you for taking the time to read my essay and I hope you can see things my way and recognize the positive role of computers."
1671	1675	1	3	"One evening, @CAPS1 I got home from school, I realized I didn't know what I had for homework. I decided to call my friend's cell phone, but instead I got her voicemail. I left her a quick voicemail and then called her house phone instead, but the same thing bad happened as no one picked up. Luckily, I had my other friends' numbers I could use, so I was able to get the assignment. The next day, I asked her why she didn't pick up her cell and house phone. She told me ""I'm sorry, I guess I was to busy on the computer e-mailing other people."" @CAPS1 I think of people being on the computer too much, I think they don't get enought exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. First @CAPS1 people spend too much time on the computer, they spend less time excersising. About @PERCENT1 of people do this and it's not healthy for their bodies. @CAPS2 people do this too often, then they will not get enough excercise and without excersise then they won't be healthy @CAPS1 they get older. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2 adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @NUM1 hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @CAPS2 adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's to early for kids to be unhealthy."" I also agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1, she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don't care about nature, @CAPS1 people do this, I can't stand it. Its like they don't care about anything else around them. What I don't get is why can't they go outside and do something for at least a half hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. You could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand @CAPS2 its a bad day like @CAPS2 its snowing or a thunderstorm and you can't do anything outside, then you go on the computer. I think that at least @PERCENT2 of people would try this and feel better for it. Third, @CAPS2 people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hung out with friends or family. @CAPS2 your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. But you can't because your on the computer, she would be furious at you for ignoring her. You picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There's probably a @PERCENT1 chance she won't ever talk to ou again, and I don't blame her for feeling that way. People who spend to much time on the computer, would barely understand whats going on in real life. @CAPS2 someone tells you something, it goes in one ear and out the other because you are distracted. @CAPS1 people do this, its really dissappointing because you dont hang out as much as with your friends and family. As you can see, people are spending too much time on the computer than excersing, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. @CAPS2 you ask me, I don't play on the computer as much which is a good thing for my health and my relationships."
1672	1676	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society. Well I would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out regularly then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life completely. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way and have similar stories. The computer is like a addiction that is hard to break. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off, you just keep scrolling and clicking. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast as you intended. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny and keep you entertained. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else for hours. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see often but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up in a digital world. I dont think we should get rede of computers entirely but we should spend least tine as we do know on them. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer and its screens. Every were you look theres a computer, in homes, offices, and even pockets. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? It is a question we all must consider for our future well-being.
1673	1677	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers have increased significantly in recent years. You don't see kids outside as often as you used to. On the news, you hear about obesity rates climbing. And you hear the crime rates go up in various communities. This does not benefit the socierty in a positive way. Computers has a negative effect on people and their daily lives. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children away? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer, playing games or chatting online. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends, which is a sad reality. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk that many don't consider. You don't know the person on the other side of the screen. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life outside your home. You'd be the outsider looking in. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore because she is always online. Do you want your child to be the outsider in their own life? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant for your mind. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer, which is unhealthy. I have met a obese child named @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen, which is alarming. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food like chips and candy. He never exercises or take a break to go outside. His report card is unbelievable and has dropped significantly. He used to be A @CAPS3 student, but not anymore. Now he's in a dump academically. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all when she tells him to stop. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood through the door."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days; it is a direct result of this lifestyle. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer and how many followers you have. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now in our communities. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are; they could be predators. Especially, miners who lie about their age to get access. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men and their tricks. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around the system. They can use someone's name and be underover, hiding their true identity. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed, which is a tragedy. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime from the comfort of their home. Do you want your child to be next in the statistics? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people with bad intentions. Kids are never outside again, enjoying fresh air. They are getting obese from lack of activity. And it's a way they get kidnapped by strangers online. Don't allow this to happen to your family. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now before it is too late! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun without any screens. And don't let these sick-minded people get to you or your kids through the internet. Take action now to protect your loved ones and ensure a healthier future."
1674	1678	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2: The effects computers have on people are bad because they are getting too addicted, the computers is a dangerous site to go on, and their brain is smarter then the @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, they are getting too addicting because computers @MONTH1 have a benefit of you being able to serf the internet but you'll get hooked on it too much and waste time. For example, youtube is an internet siting that about @NUM1 people go on and barely get off once they start watching videos. The people don't turn off their computers to just go get some exercise but just sit there staring at the @CAPS5 and messing up their eyesite from the strain. These people need to learn have the will power to get off the @CAPS5 and live their real lives. Second, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on because some people in the @LOCATION1 give somebody their @CAPS3 on the @CAPS5 to somebody they don't know about, which is risky. Almost @PERCENT2 of teens get kidnapped because od giving their @CAPS3 a way to stranger online and @PERCENT3 of those teens don't get found, which is a scary thought. The @CAPS5 is also a place of where a child or teen @MONTH1 get cyber bullied by their peers. Cyberbullying is harrassing children or teens on the internet, when children under or over @NUM2 get cyberbullied they sometimes suffer through a deppression and don't tell their parents about it, feeling alone. Six months ago at my old @CAPS4, there was a volunteer at my @CAPS4 talking about cyberbullying and how he got so depressed because of the harrassment, that he commited suicide, which was devastating. The @CAPS5 is not always a safe place to be on for young minds. Finally, your brain more smarter than the @CAPS5 and should be used more.People can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on the their computers because your brains are like computers but better. About @PERCENT1 of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life without constant digital help. The brain is like a @CAPS5 because you can store information and nobody can hack into it, keeping your thoughts safe. So therefore, computers have bad effects on people because they are getting to addicting, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on, and your brain is smarter than tha @CAPS5, so we should rely on it more.
1675	1679	1	3	Dear society, @CAPS1't you all have some kind of computer at home? Or at work? What if we took you computer away? How would you work or manage your daily tasks? These are all esential questions we need to ask ourselves. The computers of our time help us with what we do everyday, making tasks easier. First of all they teach hand-eye coordination through typing and using the mouse. Secondly they give us the ability to learn and communicate with the far away places, breaking down distance barriers. Lastly, They allow people to communicate quickly by an email or an @CAPS2, which is almost instant. If those experts took our computers, @CAPS6 about what would happen to our productivity and connections. @PERCENT1 of americans have a computer or a cellphone with internet, showing how widespread their use is. These people have hane-eye coordination, therefore they use technology alot in their jobs and personal lives. People who use computers at work can multi-task efficiently, handling several things at once. Secondly the modern computer lis a huge necessity for many professions and education. Thirdly, The people who are still in school have to write papers, do reports, but with-out computers, how would they manage? How will they accomplish that? @CAPS6 about what society would be like without this technology. Picture it for a moment. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4. These are all websites that have chats where people can communicate with friends and family across the globe. Take it away and see what happens to those connections. We only have the telephone then, but what if we @CAPS1't know some ones cellphone number? We can't go on a computer that isn't there to look it up. Take all of that into consideration before making a decision. Maybe the computer prevents us from some face-to-face communication, but it's a common necessity in the modern world. We need to be able to ask someone a quick question without delay. Cellphones and calling aren't as quick as sending a message on @CAPS2. Do you really want to be the one to take it away and go back
1676	1680	1	3	I think that we are all spending too much time on computers because all of my friends are on them all day. I think that people should get active and go to different places in the world like the pool, the forest, the lakes, and other spots. I think that they should put a program together where people go places and forget about the computer. For me, computers are good but you cannot spend a lot of time on them; you should try to spend more time outdoors and with your family or friends. And the problem is not only with computers; it is with a lot of technology like video games such as Xbox, Game Boy, and others. You should play them only a few hours a week because there are a lot of activities you and your family can do outdoors. I will take a walk around the park or ride bikes with my friends around town and make a picnic in the park when it is hot and good outside. Now that the summer is coming, you can go and do a lot of stuff. Even if you do not have money, you can go to the park or beach and spend the whole day there. What my family does when it is good outside is that we will check the weather and see if it is good, and if it is, we will get up and go to the store to buy hamburgers, soda, plates, and other stuff we are going to use. Then we will go to a lake or pool and spend the day playing and eating. My opinion is that people should spend more time outdoors with their friends and family. I want people to know that there is a world outside and to not get too addicted to the technology world. That is my opinion. I do not know if you like it, but I think you should try it, and if you do not like it, get into an activity; they will help you a lot. I am writing this because I want people to know that there are a lot of places that are yet to be discovered, so go out there and enjoy. Life only comes one time, so enjoy it with happy times and good times; do not spend it crying and sad. Live like this is your last day on this world.
1677	1681	1	3	Dear town, as you know, computers are a part of our lives, but is their influence positive or negative? Computers can be a great thing; they can show you different parts of the world and breaking news, and they can help you decide your next vacation. They could help you talk to family and friends. What would our lives be without them? Well, our lives without computers could be difficult in some ways. However, computers do have negative sides, like spending lots of money on them all the time. They often need to be fixed, which is costly. People can use the computer too much and they forget to exercise. That can lead to weight gain and health problems. Also, you can waste lots of energy using them. A bad part about the internet is chat rooms; if you talk to the wrong people then you can be in serious trouble. Overall, computers are a key part of our world and they can help decide our next vacation trip, but they can also contribute to making us fat if we are not careful.
1678	1682	1	3	Many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them. But are they as bad for individuals to use as people say they are? In this instance, a sense of moderation would be helpful. When you think of computers, what comes to mind? Games? Social networking? What if computers are doing more than that? Last year, a computer helped diagnose a concussion of mine and helped figure out I've had several others. Not to mention the computer did it quicker and more efficiently than a regular human could. An expert says that computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, much more accurately than doctors. Even social networking has a positive aspect. This has let people, who haven't seen each other for a long time, reconnect and become good friends again. With the positive aspects there is always a negative. Computers have started to make kids obese. This is a problem in the country because if we become lazy then we could ruin our health. In addition, if we become too reliant on computers for diagnosis, what happens when they get faulty? These are problems that are very real and aren't being addressed adequately. If we can't deal with these problems first then computers will turn out to be a bad thing. Lastly, moderation could be extremely helpful for us today. For example, instead of using social media for friends next door, go outside and play a game with them. Social media was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street. Similarly, instead of totally relying on computers to diagnose problems, have them and the doctor work together to find out. Doing this will get great results and keep doctors prepared if the computers don't work. These are just a few examples of how moderation could be very helpful to everyone. In conclusion, having no computers wouldn't be a great idea because of how much they help society, although being totally dependent on them is a bad idea too because overuse does not have that much benefit.
1679	1683	1	3	Dear local newspaper, have you ever wondered... scroll... did you know that only the male coqui is the only coqui that sings? Some facts are easily found on the internet. The computers make researching easier; just imagine not having to drag home those gigantic books home or having to constantly find information in them. First, the computer teaches us hand-eye coordination. Second, we can learn about faraway places. Finally, we can make friends from all over the world. When the ball goes right out of the park! The plastic object with a screen, computers, teach us hand-eye coordination. It teaches us this by making our eyes stay on the screen, while our hands are on the hard, smooth keyboard. Children need hand-eye coordination for ball-playing sports like baseball, basketball, soccer and more. When you're in high school and play sports well, you might get scholarships to go to college. College is important because it has a big role in our life so we might earn great jobs. Learning about faraway places like Paris, Tokyo and so on is very interesting, unless you are learning about it through books, which can be dull and boring. The internet has taken over our research and it is relentless and without hesitation. The internet takes less time than going to the library and checking books out. Also, skimming through paragraph after paragraph on the computer is much simpler and faster.
1680	1684	1	3	Dear school board, my personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extremely bad for you, and we need to take precautions and worry about eye protection, virtual harassment, and that there are dangerous people on the internet. Eye protection is important. Although computers are useful, they are hurting our eyes by the screen being too bright and causing strain. Also if you look at the screen for too long it could make your eyes tired. I can tell you from personal experience that glasses are un-cool and some people get picked on for it, and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you cannot see as well as you did before. It could lead to needing glasses or even risking going blind. Virtual harassment is another thing to be aware of. Over the internet you could be cyberbullied by kids you may or may not know. For example, one day you could be on a social media site and be talking in a chat room and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or even just plain rude remarks. Which brings me to the issue of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is extremely damaging and can make people feel unusually bad about themselves. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding their race, their gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra precaution when seeing sexual harassment. Sexual predators are a parent's biggest fear for their kids. Sexual predators are everywhere, on various websites, apps, and social media, or even your neighbors, and while kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do, they are extremely unsafe. This is why you should never put any personal information on the internet; not your address, not your birthday, not your cell or house numbers, nothing, not even your town. Also sometimes it is a little dangerous to put your last name. So be very careful on the internet. When you see sexual harassment, or someone being followed by a sexual predator, report them and be safe.
1681	1685	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that computers do not benefit society. I believe this because when you are on the computer you spend less time exercising. Secondly, computers make you forget about enjoying nature. Finally, interacting with family and friends is important, and when on the computer you don't do much of that. Please read on to find out what I have to say about computers. Using a computer has a lot of downfalls, but one of which is the lack of exercising while on the computer. As you may know, many countries are becoming obese because of the lack of exercise. Computers are no help to this problem. The only exercise computers contribute is for the hands and fingers, but even that is bad because if you are typing and on the computer for too long you will get carpal tunnel in the fingers and hands. An expert on health said one in three people go on the computer for more than one hour a day, which could lead to obesity. This leads to my next paragraph. When on the computer there is no enjoying the outdoors. Enjoying nature is important to every man or woman's schedule. On a computer it's impossible to enjoy nature because all the computer is is a time-consuming, brain-washing thing to do. Nature helps save the brain. Without that then you'll be very exhausted all the time. Did you know a small percentage of kids go outside every day? That means a large percentage of kids are inside on the computer. This leads to my final topic. The computer may have sites where you can talk to friends, but that is nowhere as good as seeing them in person. Your family is important so you need to spend time with them. My family always does stuff together like board games and what not. With computers there would not be any time with your family because everybody will be on the computer playing games instead of spending time with your family. In my conclusion, computers have an extraordinarily bad effect on society because it exhausts time for exercising, also limits time to enjoy nature, and finally people spend too much time on computers and too little time interacting with family and friends. Thank you for reading my paragraph on the many effects of computers.
1682	1686	1	3	Dear Editor, My name is John and I am concerned that people around the world use computers too much during the day. Some computers are bad because there are glitches in the computer, and everyone has a Myspace, and Myspace has viruses that leave a virus in your computer, causing it to shut down or go slow. Also, people can hack your computer without you finding out, and everything that was on your computer can be sent around the world. People can know your most sacred secrets and more. Finally, you can get caught making movies on your computer and go to jail, and your business will be out for everyone to see. These are serious dangers that come from using computers too frequently and without caution, which is why I feel it is important to share my concerns.
1683	1687	1	3	"Dear Editor, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information, and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. There is video-chatting, e-mail, and chat websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Skype, etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer if you are web-chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as Facebook, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to another state and had to leave all my friends behind, the computer has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn't want to. I can e-mail my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on Facebook. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to a specific location, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said, ""Computers just make finding all of the information I need to know about your brother's diabetes so easy."" Finding information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just Google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made finding information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won't take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people stay in touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that is needed, and they make our school lives easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!"
1684	1688	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have become concerned because lately a lot of people have been using computers a lot. My concern is that they haven't been exercising much, they aren't enjoying nature, and they aren't spending much time with their family. This is not a positive way for their life. In my opinion, exercising is a very, very, very important thing to do. This is because you need to maintain a healthy diet to stay healthy and you need to exercise. Some people I know don't exercise and they are either overweight or not healthy. People are ""busy"", as they say, using the computer to do all their work because they just don't like using the old-fashioned way, which is going to your job and doing your work. Everything is different now and people have become lazier than ever before. Would people be lazy if computers weren't around? Of course they wouldn't be. They would have a happy, healthy life. Now-a-days, people don't go out and explore the world much; they just go online and they search a place up on Google. They don't see the real thing though. They see pictures and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way, way better than looking at a picture. But I guess everyone forgot about that. Computers have everything online, no wonder people don't want to leave their homes, and if they do leave, don't worry they have a laptop with them. Computers are even portable, so wherever they go they're still going to go online. People have also spent less time with family because they could talk to them online in a chat room. This isn't a good thing because what if you were talking to your ""mother"", well at least you think it is your mother but it is someone else, and you're talking about something private and that person on the other computer will know about that and can cause problems for you. You know what I mean? Like if you were talking about your credit card and that person asked you for your credit card number and you gave it to them, then they could cause problems. Online isn't a safe place, that's why you should talk in person, not on a chat room. Well I hope that you put my letter in the newspaper so people could exercise, see nature, and be with family, like they were when they didn't have computers around."
1685	1689	1	3	Dear Editor, Many people use the internet too much, which leads to a lack of exercise. Others play games online. Some people fear online chat rooms. They aren't safe; some people get really injured or murdered. Exercise is important, but people let that hobby go. That is very dangerous because your cholesterol will rise. You will gain weight and that can lower your self-esteem. Other people commit suicide because of the way they appear, and no one wants that. That is sad for everyone, plus it's not worth it. Video games online are very amusing. But people would kill for these games; games are a problem, let alone online ones. Online chat rooms are very dangerous; you never know who you're writing to. Millions of people have died for saying the wrong stuff. Others have been raped or molested by these strangers. Thousands of kids give out their address and have been robbed. There are weird, crazy, or suicidal people in the world. So don't make yourself a target. I personally don't agree with computer use at all. So many things can happen if you do the wrong stuff. So I hope you understand and agree with my reasons for being cautious about computer use.
1686	1690	1	3	My opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out. If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she should go outside and get some fresh air and get some exercise. Sometimes the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quite helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or build things, and to meet new people, it can be a dangerous place as well. You can meet someone who is lying about their age and that person might rape or murder/kill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralyzed from lack of exercise or get lymph edema, that's when your body appears swollen and will not be able to exercise and would need special treatments like massages. Computers can also be good because they can give you hand eye coordination by using the skill of looking and sometimes some people use the computer for videos and websites. You can get your computer upgraded for better quality. Some systems have computers in them or can be connected to the computer like cars and home appliances. There are games called p.c. games; some p.c. games communicate with children to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also special computers and/or web-sites you can search for tutorials for speaking different languages. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instruments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptiness inside of them instead of eating. Some people abuse the computer as a drug, like they're addicted to it. Imagine someone addicted to computers; everywhere he/she goes they would take their laptop with them. Many people have died using the computer but that's because they abused it. Everyday people buy computers; this invention is very helpful and as time goes on scientists are making new things to save lives.
1687	1691	1	3	Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 your workers wake up in the @TIME1, they stretch their right muscles and put on their fuzzy slippers. They wander down the hallway and open their @CAPS2 book air to check the weather for today. They go on @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, and other sites to view their e-mails sent from work friends, and family. They check the time on the bottom of the laptop screen and log onto games as they are getting ready. Society today relies heavily on computers and the network that keeps us all connected. With technological advances happening today, people are now using computers to help with their work. But is that a problem? Some @MONTH1 say that it is, due to the fact the amount of time spent on the computer is too much and that it stops people from interacting with friends, but it does help. Computers help with the skill of typing, help with fast and easy research, and helps friends and family connect through @NUM2 different platforms like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people and are a great addition to society. To begin, computers help to reach @CAPS6, children, and even adults learn the skill of typing. Statistics show that more and more jobs require computers and hire people with a higher words per minute ability, with almost @PERCENT1 of companies adopting new computers and using them to store information. For their company, computers are a necessity and so is the knowledge of understanding computers and being able to type. Moreover, @CAPS6 these days are depending on computers for research in order to do projects and find information. I can personally connect to this because being a student at @LOCATION1 school, I am assigned projects which involve typed words and online information. How hard it would be if I had to hand write all of my work and search for information manually. @CAPS1 multiple @CAPS6 are assigned the same project, the teacher does not have a million @CAPS6 to check. If there was no computer to use, what would I do? For @CAPS6, computers are a great thing. Furthermore, @CAPS6 and even adults enjoy social time, but if friends and family live far away or you are not able to visit them, the computer comes in handy. Computers help to keep friends and family connected through @CAPS3, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 or @NUM1, instant messaging, and webcam video chats. All of those computer related things would not be there if there were no computer. Would you want to be disconnected from family? Being social is a key part of being human, so why shouldn't we keep them? With all of these positive things about computers, why would anyone ever doubt them? In conclusion, computers are wonderful things. They help to build the skill of typing, help with fast and easy research, and also help keep friends and family connected. Computers affect people in only good ways and help everyday life be easier. So, I believe that computers are a great thing and that without them, even just talking to family could be jeopardized. Let's keep computers.
1688	1692	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1, People have been saying that computers are not beneficial, but they are wrong. In my opinion computers are very beneficial. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places, and you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand-eye coordination? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type without having to look down at the keyboard. Even if people don't have the program they can learn how to type fast without having to look down. Many people that I know have learned how to use the computer or type without anyone telling them how to do so. Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. If you go on the internet you can search for a person or place and the computer will find it for you. Children and adults need computers because if, for example, a child gets a project from school that needs to be done about a famous person or a topic like smoking, they would most likely need to go to the internet. The same goes for adults that have jobs in offices, schools or anywhere else. Computers are essential to people all around the world. Computers can be used to communicate with each other. People use computers to communicate with friends or family in far away places. They can communicate via e-mail, @CAPS2, video calls and maybe even on other web sites. Some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. Why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer? Computers can be used to learn hand-eye coordination and help you move your fingers faster. They give people information about people and places in the world. Finally, they can be used to communicate with one another through e-mail, messages and many other ways. In my opinion, computers are one of the most important things to a person.
1689	1693	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Have you noticed that nowadays more and more people are becoming overweight? Well it's true. People say that it is because of eating a lot of fast food but I think that since we are always on the computer and not exercising, it helps contribute to it. Also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. Sitting in front of the computer isn't going to help our environment. Lastly, kids aren't getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. I'm not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way to limit it. To start off with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. Some @MONTH1 say that people choose not to exercise but if we limit things then they won't have to choose. As a kid myself, I love to be on the computer. My parents are always trying to get me off the computer and take the dogs for a walk and I always say ""I'm busy"" and it's true; I don't really like to go outside because I have a computer to play games or talk to friends and to be honest exercising to me seems important but I don't do it because I'm always on the computer. I think that other people could feel this way so that's why we need to limit the computer. Secondly, global warming is occurring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer than go outside and enjoy the nature. Sure, you can look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? Some might not because they could just stay on the computer and keep ""looking up"" ways to help. Another thing is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming so if we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. Lastly, internet sites like myspace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. When we get out and interact with our friends we gain skills like communication, teamwork and respect; friends and family can teach you this in person, but through the computer they can't. Also interacting with your family and friend might let you go to new places that you haven't been before and on the computer you can't go there. Interacting with friends & family is better than talking through the computer. In conclusion if we stay on the computer then we won't get exercise, enjoy nature or interact with friends. So we need to act now and limit computer usage!"
1690	1694	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise, don't get to enjoy the nature around them, and they don't get to interact with their family and friends! If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer, then they wouldn't be having too many issues. People need to spend less time on computers and spend more time exercising! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands. You don't tend to want to get up or do anything else when you're on your computer, right? Well that needs to change. Often, people get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one. Some people are so obsessed, they might even break down and have a fit! Nobody wants to see someone throw a fit because they have to get off the computer, do they? If they don't get exercise, anytime when you're not on a computer it can definitely show. Jimmy @CAPS2 says, ""I see @NUM1 kids are on their computers way too much! They never come out of their rooms, and if they ever do, then they are normally very cranky. They're getting fat! I can tell because all they eat is junk food. This needs to change."" He can't even have a little bit of time with his children. They should go on a family trip and enjoy time together! That brings us to the next issue. We all need to enjoy nature more. Why would you spend your time on a computer looking at pictures of nature when you have it right there in your backyard? It's because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy chairs and go outside. The best thing about nature is that if you are feeling like you need to be alone or even just need to get some air, nature is always there for you anytime you need it. You can always go outside with your friends and family too! I'm sure that they would appreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together. Yet again, our next and final issue. Computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends. When talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun? Also, when you spend time with your family, it brings them a lot closer to you. Nobody likes to not talk to the people you love and the people who raised you. When you're on a computer I just think of all the places you could go, places you could be with people. Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family. Therefore, people should turn off their computers, go exercise, be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family. Thank you."
1691	1695	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, As you know, many people are starting to buy and own computers. Some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors. I disagree with this statement. First, computers help us with every day life. We check news on computers, some people even use their computers as a television and watch important shows. Second, a computer is a great way to communicate. Whether its friends, family or even business, a computer is a excellent way of communication. Finally, a computer is helpful when it comes to school or work. You could write a paper on the computer, for example, or read on to see how I support my reasons of why computers are helpful in peoples lives. Have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about? Well, if you had a computer, you could go online to the news website and read more. This is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life, there are plenty more. Another way is if you don't own a television, you could watch your favorite show on the computer. My english teacher Mrs. Smith says ""I never owned a television, I only watch shows on my computer and I like it better."" In fact a large percentage of people who watch videos on the computer like it better than television. This is how computers come in handy in every day life. I love how computers have many ways of communicating. I like it because I have several relatives who live far away and I use my computer to communicate with them from time to time. Skype is my favorite, I can see the person I am talking to at the same time. Also computers can be good for business for large companies who need to communicate out of the country. I'm sure being an amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy communication. Finally, communication with friends. These are many programs for this, such as Facebook and Myspace. This is why a computer is a good way of communication. Finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. It's much faster than writing. Also, if you need more info on something, you could look it up online. Like if you are writing an article on dolphins, you could learn more about them. In conclusion I think computers are good things. They help with everyday life, they are good for communication, and last they help at school or work."
1692	1696	1	3	Wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life? I would, we need computers for many things, for example we need computers for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. Next, this is good for buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benefit society is because of communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example, if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Computers could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you might have missed as if you were absent. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you might be interested in, or you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Nowadays many college students with work going on might not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. For some students instead of studying in a classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more engaging for the students so maybe they would understand topics better. Like science for example, when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. With computers students could learn more because they would have access to online textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like eBay, that is a website many people sell items on to make money and other people can buy them. So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to their house instead of driving around from store to store. As I have told you about communications, education, and buying and selling products, I hope you agree with me that computers do benefit society.
1693	1697	1	3	Dear local newspaper editor, Don't you love having the internet at your finger tips? Recently, it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I firmly believe that this is correct. My three arguments are its not healthy, the friends you meet up there are cyber friends and bad things might occur. First of all, being on the computer too much is not healthy. This reminds me of my friend named Becky. Becky used to be humorous, outgoing and play a lot of sports. One day, her mother bought her a laptop. This laptop was blue and white-her two favorite colors. She was on it all day and all night. She took it with her everywhere she went. Well, it got to the point where she stopped the sports, gained some weight and the sadness crept upon her. She was in a depression mode. She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only. She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun Becky she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. Second of all, the friends you meet on the internet are called cyber friends. You don't know who they really are, where they really live, or their real age. They can tell you anything they want because they know that that's a little fantasy world. That is mentally not healthy. It is very important for human beings to be socially active. Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also. Third of all, bad things might pop up. If you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get like Becky, it is not good for you or the device. Being on the computer can harm even the computer itself. Well, you've read my arguments and ideas. Please take them into consideration for the well-being of our community.
1694	1698	1	3	Computers, Computers, Computers! That’s the first thing a teenager does right when they get home from school. Teenagers just can't wait to chat with their friends on Facebook and instant message. There are a lot of positive and negative things about computers. In these paragraphs below I am going to give you my opinion, tell you how people can manage their time better and the effects it can have. My personal experience with computers is that they have so much information but sometimes it can be too much. Today, a lot of children and teenagers are getting bullied. People can send horrible messages to someone. They rather do it on the computer because they don't have to say it to their faces. That is one thing that I don't like about computers is that people can get harassed. Other than that I think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past. Not a lot of parents want to see their child coming straight home from school and go right to the computer. Parents have to be strict with their child when it comes to computers. They need to manage their time so they can also do their homework, after school activities etc.... Studies have shown that children who go on the computer every single day for more than two hours are most likely to see their grades drop. That's why if you mange your time it wouldn't be a problem. You want your child to have a balance in their life, so manage the time where they are not on it all day long. There are positive things about the computer and as well as negative things. The computer is a great way to research people you are learning about in school and find people from your past; for example, Facebook is a great way to stay connected to your old buddies. Google is also a great tool because you can type in anything and it will give you a hundred websites to chose from. A negative effect about it is that people are likely to say things on it to other people that they wouldn't dare to say to their face. It also prevents you from doing other things because you get so consumed about the computer you forget your main priorities. In these paragraphs I gave you my opinion on computers and how there are positive and negative things about them. I also explained how it can take up your time with your main priorities in life and how to manage your time wisely. The computer is a great tool but don't take too much advantage of it because it is not a priority.
1695	1699	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on peoples' lives. You can do a lot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convenient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see France, you can go online to learn the language. You can also study foods that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can download are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action games that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure games that let you explore new lands. And in a lot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are other ways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, Facebook, Twitter, and video chat. With any of these things you can talk to friends or family around the world or in your state or country. All of these you can either download, go on the internet for, or buy them. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you haven't seen in a while. With video chat you can see each other, with Facebook you can share pictures and in chat rooms you can talk with multiple people. In conclusion computers are very convenient for our society today. Whether it's studying the world, having fun, or talking to people you know, the computer has many wondrous things for people.
1696	1700	1	3	"What is technology? Technology is defined as anything that helps enhance our way of living. Technology is all around us. Our beds, houses, televisions and even chairs are all forms of technology. There is one form of technology however, in my opinion, that has revolutionized modern day living as we know it. This form of technology is called the computer. My outlook on the effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive. Just think of all of the things we rely on this device to do. There is one thing, however that really sticks out in my mind; communication. The computer is perhaps the greatest form of communication the world has ever seen. E-mail is basically sending a letter to a friend without the hassle of mailing it out where it might get lost or stolen. E-mailing is two simple steps: typing and sending. Not only does it lower the risk of the letter not getting there, but it is also much quicker. You hit the ""send"" button and before you know it, a new letter is sitting in your friend's inbox. Another method of computerized communication is my personal favorite, instant messaging. Instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away. And it's okay if you decide to go get a soda while you are instant messaging because unlike a real conversation, that isn't rude. These are just two methods of communication that the computer enables us to have. There is a variety of others that, much like these two, enhance our way of life. I believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing: the internet. The internet makes everything we do on the computer possible. If I want to go on the computer and do research on a topic, the internet takes me where I want to go. With millions of different websites, the internet has endless possibilities. If I'm interested in arcade games, I can go on the internet and play them. If I have to write a science report, then I can go on the internet and collect research. If I want to listen to music, then I can go on the computer, look up a song, and listen to it. And guess what? If I'm looking for a funny video just for a good laugh, then the internet can find me one! The internet is perhaps one of the greatest things ever invented. It's just another reason to love the computer and the incredible convenience it brings to our daily lives."
1697	1701	1	3	The computer is able to do so many things. I think computers have positive effects on people. But some experts believe they don’t, which is why I'm writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who has a house, their chances of having a computer is just as likely as having a telephone. Computers, believe it or not, help us in life whether it is to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or whatever it is we need. That is why computers are so positive. If we did not have computers there would not be any of the technological advances that we have today, making the computer one of the most important devices. Let me share my experience. I had a job interview, right? Well, I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions. I made it to my interview. That's why I think computers have positive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Well, I think some people spend too much time on their computer, but that is completely their own choice. And those are people who usually don't have a lot of self control. And exercising? Who said that everyone needs exercise? If the person is already skinny, what do they need to exercise for? For the interacting with friends and family, you can still do that. I mean, how long can a person look at a computer screen? So in conclusion you can see that computers are good, but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time you are on the computer, enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health are more important and deserve your time and attention as well.
1698	1702	1	3	"Dear Future Employers, I, as a computer user, think computers are helpful in many ways. They help get new information. They help function machines. They help people learn new things. Computers help find and get new jobs. They provide the public with another way to find a new or another job. My brother, for example, he went to a university where he learned how to become a mechanic. He was having a hard time finding a job, looking for work on the street, so someone told him to go on a job website and go to ""mechanic jobs."" He did and there on the computer he found a good job and still works there. The computer is a great way to find a job. Computers help function machines. All the machines that we have to use and had to run by hand now run by computers. That is good in some ways and bad in another way. They help make more product in less time. Today more cars are being made in less time; if you've seen scenes of car factories you saw the assembly line with mechanical robot hands putting them together and that is using computers. One major problem to this is many people are losing their jobs. The computer teaches people new skills, but it also replaces some traditional roles. Ultimately, computers are powerful tools that drive progress, but we must be mindful of their impact on the workforce and adapt accordingly."
1699	1703	1	3	"Dear School Administration Committee, The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle schooler growing up, I believe using computers can be beneficial at some point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of inappropriate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just a single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to ""hack"" or trespass someone else's computer. Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download inappropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use, criminal acts, vulgar language and more. A recent study on internet use from the Center for Internet Safety includes that ""cyber bullying"" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. Cyber bullying is a form of bullying where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is cyber bullying an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, appearance, and location. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. According to a recent study at the National Institute of Health, a significant percentage of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as social media because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much ""fun"" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Addiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for twelve hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be inappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity? More and more people become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my opinion, so we must learn to use it wisely and with caution."
1700	1704	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I support the advances in technology, and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I think this for three simple reasons. First, you gain computer skills, which can help in other situations. Second: Computers give people the chance to learn about faraway people and places. Lastly when you have a computer you can chat and talk to other people. When I think of a computer, I think of typing or a keyboard. After a few times of using a computer you get accustomed and better at it. You gain typing skills, hand eye coordination and mouse skills. After just a few uses, your computer skills build up and you soon get good at it. When you do get accustomed though, you get better quicker and more so it all works out very well. When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search anything and everything. Whether it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is helpful. When I am doing my homework, and I don't know how to answer a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get help with any homework I need help in, its great. I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but there's no one to talk to? Well that problem can be solved very simply, get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone half way around the world. Its amazing you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. A computer's chat allows you to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. Computers are great. When you're on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it. They are helpful and fun; you never run out of options with a computer at your side. In my opinion, there is so much to gain and learn from a computer, making it an invaluable tool for education, connection, and personal growth in our modern world.
1701	1705	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room and seeing people interacting with their computer screen is an exciting experience, as they are earning new and exciting information they can use every day. The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach valuable hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definitely have a positive impact on society. Computers have taught a very valuable skill to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whether it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching game of Bejeweled, you are learning and improving your hand-eye coordination. According to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said they developed it while using the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwhelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill for many tasks. These brilliant inventions also help us learn about different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; a student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds the information on @ORGANIZATION2 just like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastest ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy, especially when you need information online. But why stop there? Not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's currently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definitely an easy source for information on different areas and people from all over the world. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, or you can use a device in the @CAPS8 to call someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do that one. I remember a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my classmate but he didn't answer. I then sprinted to my computer to see if he was online. Sure enough he was! I got the homework assignment and got an A, all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others so quickly and efficiently.
1702	1706	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a good effect on people and not a bad effect. I think this for three important reasons. My first reason is that they relieve stress and make tasks easier. Without a computer, in my opinion, things would be a lot more stressful and time-consuming. With a computer you can easily look things up without wasting time or being stressed out by having to manually look for something in a large library. My second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is the broader scope of technology. Without modern technology things would be so much harder to accomplish on a daily basis. Without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments, print out pictures for projects, and access the latest information quickly. If we didn't have technology as in computers I think a lot of things would go wrong and our productivity would drop significantly. My third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them many factories would crash and stop working. I say this because if you think about it, almost every machine in a factory is ran by some type of computer system. Without that computer telling the machines what to do, everything practically wouldn't work correctly! Without the computer everything would become so time consuming and inefficient that no one would want to get the work done properly. These are my three reasons why I think computers have a good effect on people and our modern world.
1703	1707	1	3	Dear whom it @CAPS1, Have you ever wondered what it would be like to spend all your time in front of computers? Well, if you are, I believe that you should not be in front of that computer all day long. As my mom says, only an hour a day is good for you. One reason why it is important to limit screen time is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer beyond the screen. You could do stuff like play catch with the dog, walk the dog, and play over a friend's house. Yes, playing on the computer is fun, but you have to exercise and move your body too, you know. The @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere wonderful where you did not even know you needed to go. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors and exploring your neighborhood. Like that's how I met trees, saw animals, and enjoyed beautiful scenery. You could feel like you were having the time of your life outside. The last and final reason why this is important is you can get a lot out of the outdoors that you could use for fun and creativity. You could make snowmen in the winter or if it's raining you could watch a movie with your family. You could build a lot of memories outside. In conclusion, building, playing and jumping, the list could go on and on, are things you can enjoy in the outdoors. Just remember the three good reasons why are you could use the wonderful and lovely outdoors for so many activities. Go walk your dog, have friends over or even just hang out with your family and friends outside in the fresh air.
1704	1708	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a big thing nowadays; you can look up information, learn new things, and they keep you busy and engaged. It brings a whole package of benefits to our daily lives. Learning and getting information like facts, historical events, and the @CAPS1 helps us understand what we are living around and know how things came together over time. A computer is like a trip to the library, as all the information is pretty much the same but more accessible. You can look things up for a school project or for personal interest too. And what's best of all is that I can access it all in a flash, with files organized in folders if the computer is set up properly. You learn some new things now everyday and people both look it up on various websites. It could be a different website all the time like @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 and etc. Some people can't live without these things either, but sometimes these objects on a computer, like any music player where you have to download music or apps, can be engaging. At the same time, having these things keeps you busy and moving from one task to another. Computers are a big thing, as you can see they put an impact in someone's daily routine. Looking up info, learning new skills, and its entertainment value are some reasons why a computer or laptop they bring so much to our lives.
1705	1709	1	3	Everyone loves staying on the computer for long hours. I would be surprised if one does not feel its pull. I believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that are also as enjoyable as it is. People learn too much on it, and not always good things. It changes people's whole life and perspective on the world. The computer is like a disease or a virus that controls you, and gaining your freedom from it is perfectly possible but difficult. I understand that some people in @MONTH1 may not agree with me, however I propose that my side is the best and most realistic. This is horrible, how can it not be? It distracts people from their real life and responsibilities. It makes them blind to the joy of nature and the physical world. Spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease of modern life. The hard part of getting your freedom back is being able to know and admit that it is controlling you. That way your door to freedom will be open for you to walk through. The technology keeps you away from having real fun, doing homework from school properly, and having genuine fun with friends in person. I know that you can break free from it because I once experienced the same thing and its powerful grip. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed, I admit. It has so much information in it you won't even think a person could hold it all. I know it can teach you even more than books sometimes. However it is also very foul and dangerous. Once I came upon a very horrible scene on the computer that I could not shut out of my mind. Machines have a mind of their own and they can influence our thoughts and actions. Changing a person's life is not easy, it takes time and effort. You become a completely new person sometimes. Sometimes those changes are good and sometimes they are bad for your character. But a machine can make you change in just ten minutes of exposure. Once you see what you like on it or what you want so badly, you can change your desires and priorities. If you see something and you want it so bad, and you can't get it, then you will be forced to consider getting it by stealing or other bad means. It is a very horrible thing to learn from a screen. All you have to do is learn to control yourself and your usage. Machines are a very bad influence on people if not used wisely. There are books if you need information, you do not always need a screen. Computers make you lazy; you don't have to read or think hard as it does the work for you. It can take over your life if you let it. You become dependent on it for everything. It teaches you bad things and it changes your life path, so you must consider carefully what path you would take.
1706	1710	1	3	Wouldn't you agree that computers have a great effect on people? The three reasons why they have a good effect on people are because they help develop good typing skills, they are educational, and they assist you with a lot of things. The first reason why computers have a good effect on people is because they help your typing skills. If you have a computer you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good. Each time you use the computer your hands adjust to the keys, learning the layout through repeated practice. Say if there is someone that wants to work with computers when they get older, well if they practice their typing on their computers at home they will be eligible for the job working with computers. Also computers could be good for the hearing impaired. If the hearing impaired use the computers then they can get a webcam or a headset and chat with people online. This would be useful to them because since they could not hear what people say they can read what people say through the internet, facilitating communication. Another reason why computers have a good effect on people is because they are very educational. In my opinion, computers are very educational because there are a lot of websites that teach you facts about different places. For example, what food people eat in different countries, or where that country is located on a map. A website that is the best for finding out accurate facts is www.Ask.com. Ask.com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds, providing quick answers. Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites that offer detailed information. The last reason why computers have an effect on people is because they help you with a lot of things. They help you with a lot of things because if you want to know how far one city is from another then you can go on your pc and find out, or say that you lost the directions to your friends house and you are on your way to their house if you brought your laptop you can go on the laptop and find where her house is from your laptop. I know your probably thinking there is such thing as a gps, well if you think about it gps's can be confusing, but your computer reads it out to you clearly. Now your probably saying in your heads why don't you text or call your friend, but if you think about it what if your friend does not talk clearly. In conclusion, wouldn't you agree that computers do have good effects on people. My three arguments are, they help your typing skill, they are educational, and they help you with things. Please take my ideas into consideration.
1707	1711	1	3	My experience with computers is good because I can play games or do my homework efficiently. I can install my own music on my computer and do my homework at the same time, managing multiple tasks. I can also go on the internet with computers to browse websites and find information. On computers I can also do things quicker and easier, like editing documents without rewriting them. I can also get more things done faster by getting the internet and going on it because I can do research and copy and paste stuff off the internet, saving a lot of time. I now have a laptop and it is pretty much a portable computer. On my laptop I can make data tables and graphs and write papers and use a dial up connection. Dial up connection is what I can use to get free internet by putting a persons phone number in the place were the phone number goes the laptop will call up the modem if the phone line is connected to the modem, establishing a connection. On my laptop I also have a place to put a floppy disc in and a place for a CD-ROM to go in to, allowing me to use different types of media. I also have a calculator on my laptop for quick math. Some laptops also have a mouse that looks like a little pad like mine does, which is called a touchpad. As you can see computers and laptops are really good to own for their versatility and convenience.
1708	1712	1	3	Dear The School Board, they say that people are spending too much time focusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are wrong! Computers are a giant step into new technology. For example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online and give children some down time where they can learn about far away places and people. If you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly realized that you forgot one of the most important books! You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. Computers then come in handy. You can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper, ensuring your work is complete. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson, providing the help you need. Children need to communicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends children would be nowhere. Statistics show that a high percentage of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, children can do research, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about far away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now available. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers we would not know the important news when we needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future and we need to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why we need to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future. So all the people of our town keep your computers, they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology. Plus who would not want a good computer game once and a while for some entertainment.
1709	1713	1	3	Dear Principal, do you think people should stop going on the computer? Well, yes because they are not getting exercise. People's body start to get lazy and don't want to get up from their chairs. They are not spending time with the family instead they would like to spend their free time on the computer. This is my opinion, people should stop being lazy and have some fresh air. Do you people who spend time on the computer interact with their family? Well, no, because they think they will get entertain by technology instead of their family. The reason I don't like computer so much because you get hook on so fast you can't stop playing or browsing. When you interact will family you get to know them better and that is priceless, creating stronger bonds. This is why it should stop because it damage peoples minds and social skills. Another reasons I would like you to hear is less time exercising. When people don't exercise you will not do anything for their body. They start to eat too much and later they become very lazy and unhealthy. When you exercise you have tons of energy to do anything, like be active. Like bungee jump. When you exercise you look healthy and people will notice your vitality. This why exercise is the best for keeping healthy and always fit. In addition, my third reason I would like you to read is enjoying nature. Enjoying nature you can have a good time and relax your mind. You can swim in the beach, feel the amazing breeze, and have a good time with friends. When you are on the computer you are sitting down instead going outside and that because a habit that is hard to break. It will be hurting are environment because people don't want to get up to enjoy nature and appreciate the outdoors. This is why it should not be tolerated because people are being lazy and neglecting their health. In conclusion, the reason why people should not spend their life on computer because they think they will be entertain by technology instead of interacting will their family. People will start eating too much and so they will become lazy and inactive. People will never leave the house and instead they are on their computer all day long. This is why it should stop it hurting are environment and people are becoming lazy, which is not good for our community.
1710	1714	1	3	I agree that we should have computers, because more and more people use computers for many tasks. Long time ago we don't even have computers, but now we do, which is a great advancement. Now we have computers we should use them to our advantage. If we don’t use computers why we even have computers in the first place? Computers can help you to learn about faraway places like Japan, Australia, famous leaders, and other faraway places. If we don't know what is going on faraway places then we don't know what kind flag they have and what do they eat, what do they have, or what they do, and what do they speak, missing out on cultural knowledge. You can even talk online with your friends on computer through messaging! You dont have to call you friend, you can just talk to you friend online, if you need help with your homework or you left your math text book at school you friend can tell you the questions by talking online, which is very convenient. If your friend is in another country or other faraway places your friend can bring there computer with him or her so your friend can just talking to you by talking online, you dont have to call your friend in another country or other places, saving on cost. You can also learn how to type properly, when you know how to type you can type faster and faster with practice. You can type stories, poems, and notes or something you have to do at school, so you don't have to write on a piece of paper you can just type on computer and print it out neatly. That is why we should have computers and use them more often for learning and communicating. I hope you agree with me on the benefits of computers.
1711	1715	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The question is, does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? In my opinion, no, computers definitely don't make people lazy and less interactive with others around them. First, I think that computers can sometimes make you smarter. I mean you can read about history, world news and you can research many different topics. I remember when I was younger I would love to learn about the @CAPS1. I used to search it all the time and I made a poster project for fun. Thanks to the computer I got accurate information. A survey conducted by the @CAPS2 school social studies teacher shows that @PERCENT1 of their students used the computers to find facts for school projects. @PERCENT2 out of that @PERCENT1 end up getting better grades. Famous psychologist @PERSON2 says that ""kids and students learn more when they are on the computer researching or @CAPS7 new things."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that too much internet is unhealthy for people but mostly students. But at @ORGANIZATION1 it is a good source of @CAPS7 for them. Therefore the computer helps teach everyone facts and many stay informed on what's going on around the world. Second, people can interact with family and friends online. I mean there's @CAPS3 where people can socialize with their families who live out of state. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade I made a new friend and she moved to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I keep in touch with her on @CAPS3. A survey conducted by student council at that school found @PERCENT3 of students had someone they know and love move away out of state; @PERCENT4 out of that @PERCENT3 keep in touch by email or @CAPS3. Famous scientist @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""People who keep in touch with family and friends tend to stay happy and not become depressed."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that people don't need to keep in touch with their families all the time but it makes them happier. Therefore people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families. Third, you can learn new exercise, moves or tricks. I mean you can do new exercises, train for a dance competition or learn new magic tricks for your magic show. I remember when I wanted to learn how to twirl a balloon between my fingers I went and found a video of someone teaching step by step on how to do it. It's easier now. A survey conducted by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 shows that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members get stronger and more fit by @CAPS7 new exercises. Famous athlete @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 new exercises online helps me stay fit for my games"". I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that they can just go to someone to teach them BUT no one wants to pay money for something you can get free online. Therefore, @CAPS7 new exercises, moves or tricks online can help them out a lot. To conclude, does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? No, it helps them learn, socialize with family and friends and they can get in shape with the new exercises that they learn from how-to videos."
1712	1716	1	3	People think that using computers is a good thing, I think so too because there are a lot of other people in this country that speak different languages and the computers can teach them instead of a person that just speaks our language. This for some people is their lives; even a lot of people use computers for their work. Kids also use the internet not for things such as facebook, myspace, gmail, and a lot of other web pages. I also use the internet but not as much anymore but I used to go on gaming pages like, @NUM1.com or even /cup/coffee but I don't go on those anymore that much because I have xbox live and that is a thing that the internet also comes in and you can talk to your friends. Some of my friends just go on the computer and don't get any exercise at all but a lot of my friends go on it but play a lot of sports so they're not just getting fat all the time. So people in the world basically have a computer but not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1. I think that our country should write a big paycheck to those poor countries and so they can get computers and so if they come here they can speak our language, or we ship lots of computers to their countries and so they don't buy any crappy computers. Also when you're on a computer you can buy a webcam or it is already placed into your computer and you can talk to your friends or even show them what you made or something like that. So I think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or whoever did.
1713	1717	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I want to argue about the issue of computer use in @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. I'll tell you about the benefits of owning a computer. Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town are very good for society. There are the major benefits of using a computer. @CAPS3 is the fact you can use Microsoft to write up a paper. Sixth grader @PERSON6 says, ""I would rather type than write a paper."" Another reason to use a computer is for research. ""@CAPS4 many articles and facts are online about anything you need,"" says @PERSON4. The final benefit of a computer is the fact you can know about world news in a flash. ""I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage,"" says @PERSON5. Those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer. Now lets talk about something that is said to be bad but really isn't; social networking. Stuff like @CAPS5 use a texting form on a computer which helps us connect without making a huge phone bill: ""with instant messenger I can talk to @CAPS2 girlfriends,"" says @PERSON2. Also, there is Facebook which can help us connect on a global stage. ""I can talk with @CAPS2 cousin in @LOCATION2,"" says @CAPS6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. @CAPS3, we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. ""I can use @CAPS2 computer anywhere I like,"" says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eighth grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" The final major advance is the use of the printer, ""I use @CAPS2 printer to print off papers to bring to school,"" @PERSON3 said. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. There is many benefits to owning a computer. We talk to people world-wide when ever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology. @CAPS4 please help defend us kids in this case about computer use."
1714	1718	1	3	Losing @CAPS1 to @ORGANIZATION1 are a huge part of daily life these days, which is good for businesses, and schools but for people just looking to pass time, computers are a dangerous choice. Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment, but when it comes to boredom computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Also exercise is a big issue now and you aren't getting any by sitting at a computer. On the other hand though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public. Also these websites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Other pass times could be running on a treadmill or jogging which do have benefits. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day but not using the internet for just anything. Websites can be a way to find good computer time. Edline is for homework or an assignment. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive. Overall, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people; if as many people that use computers balanced that time with time to exercise, they would all be better off.
1715	1719	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 about what the world would be like without computers. Scary thought? I had the same reaction. A world without computers is a world of non-communicating people and no where to gather information independently. The benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that don't live in your area or that you just haven't talked to in a while. They also teach hand-eye coordination which is good for almost anything. Lastly, they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world. In conclusion, computers have outstanding effects on people. First of all, in my perspective, having a computer, allows me to communicate to people I've met on past vacations. I can email them and talk to them on social networks such as Facebook. This is beneficial to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family. Being able to talk to friends I haven't spoken to in a while, gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect. In conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer, is only one of the many benefits a computer has! Second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand-eye coordination as well. Dereck was a channel @NUM1 news reporter, ""I can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. I truly @CAPS1 it's because my mother taught me how to use a computer!"" @CAPS2 especially benefit from computers because they teach them hand-eye coordination which is great for those homeruns, or even touchdowns! Third of all computers allow students and many others to learn and look up things they don't know. @PERCENT1 of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research. On the other hand, businessman, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. Overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand-eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. As a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and a success for reliable information!"
1716	1720	1	3	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they promote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teach people how to do things; resources for learning skills like knitting or fixing a bike are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great scarf or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to connect with friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messenger or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people."
1717	1721	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good for society. One reason is kids can't write a @NUM1 page essay by hand they will use a computer because it is easier. People use computers every day if it's not talking with friends or playing games it's for people's business. I personally don't use a computer that often just to check my email and school work but that doesn't mean that people don't need them. People get exercise even when they don't know it like walking to school, so they are not out of shape. I personally believe that computers are not bad for us but they can be helpful like for research projects; if you don't feel like looking through a book to find information you could go on a computer and look up something and have the information at your finger tips. Why are people so concerned about what we do with our time? We exercise; nobody doesn't exercise. We exercise at school, when we walk home, when we walk our dog, or take out the trash, so they might experience a full day. Another great thing about computers is that you can video chat on a live video channel so that you can hear, talk, and see the person; this is a great resource if a parent is away on a business trip you can see them and talk to them. I have used it to talk to friends as well. Computers are also a great thing because of the programs that come with it; the programs are Word, Excel, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. They help you write essays, calculate grades, create charts, etc. Without computers we would have to do it by hand and it wouldn't be neat, it would be messy. Computers exercise your mind. The last reason why computers are so great is the internet because everything is on the internet like if you want to shop. Without the internet, you would have to go for it physically. If you want to play games, watch videos, you can chat with friends, post pictures, post videos; I could go on but I won't. All I hope is that you at @CAPS1 got my point: computers are not bad for you and that's a fact. Kids love them and adults need them. So think, if you took computers away from children and adults, how would kids learn, how would adults run businesses? Think about what you would be doing to the world without the computers we use. How would you publish your newspaper? Think about what kind of world it would be like; they can't function without the computer inside them or the computer that grades tests. People don't realize that we need computers and they need us.
1718	1722	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people are talking about computers and what it does to us. People believe that using the computer is a waste of time. I believe that computers aren't a bad thing. Using the computers can help us learn about other places in the world. It can also show us the lives about people from the past. We can also talk to our friends online. If you want to know why computers are useful, just keep on reading. People say that computers waste our lives. I disagree with that opinion. The internet is a great way to learn about different places in the world. We can learn about the climate, the animals, and the food they eat. @CAPS1 places have different types of culture. For example, in @LOCATION3 everyone eats seafood. In @LOCATION2, everyone eats spicy food. The internet can show us pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before. It's a great way to see and learn about different places compared to how you live. Do you have a friend that you haven't seen in a long time? Would you like to be in contact with that person again? Well the internet is a great way to do this. It allows you to make an account such as Twitter, Facebook, @NUM1 and more. You can search up your friends name and magic! You finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again. You would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again. @CAPS1 kids use the computer in order to do their history projects. Well the internet is here to help. You can search up famous people from the past or people from nowadays. The internet allows you to see and learn about these people's past. One example is @LOCATION1. He was the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1. You can learn so much about him like where he was born, how @CAPS1 family relatives did he have and more. So you see, the internet is a great use for kids. These are my reasons in why I believe that computers aren't bad. We still have time for family, friends and any fun outdoor activity. We can learn about different places in the world. We can talk to friends online, and we can learn about people from the past.
1719	1723	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you think that computers have bad effect on people today? I know I don't. Over @PERCENT1 of people today have a computer. On a computer you can find great things about a place and people. If you don't have the best handwriting then you can type it and computer can help you look stuff up. @CAPS1 you want to go and look up your favorite hockey player? Instead of going to the library and hoping that there's a book on him, you can just @ORGANIZATION1 his name and hundreds of different websites will come up. That will save a lot of your day and it will save a lot of your money. If you go on a family trip each year to the same place and you need a change, then you can look up another place online that @MONTH1 has the same features but it @MONTH1 be way closer than going to @LOCATION1 each year. So, if you have a computer then you can look up places you @MONTH1 want to travel to or look up cool facts about your future sports player. If you have messy handwriting and its getting harder and harder for your teacher to read then you can just learn how to type it up on the computer. At least @PERCENT2 of students in schools today are getting zero on homework or tests because their teacher can't read their handwriting. If you type it up on a computer then you will have spelling and grammar help, you can use different fonts and sizes and colors, and add pictures to make your grade higher due to the fact you put a little more work into your assignment. So, to all the people who think that computers don't help anyone, well here are reasons why computers can help someone. Computers can help kids find something or can help them; computers can also find videos about your favorite player or about your favorite hockey players giving warnings about the playoffs. You can find all good stuff online. You can find your favorite song for your cellphone. Over @PERCENT3 of people get the song from the computer. Also the computer can play your favorite song on the computer. For example if your favorite band was Dropkick Murphys then you can @ORGANIZATION1 that and you will find all of their songs. A lot of people think that computers are not good for us. But, I say they are wrong. You can find info about their future person they can look up there. If you have messy handwriting then you can go and type it up; lastly you can find songs, videos, and much more when you browse the web. For example, @LOCATION2, @MONTH1 be there very own website. Computers can help kids find info better when we type your paper instead of writing it sloppy.
1720	1724	1	3	Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, Have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society? Well, for numerous people, computers are their lives. They help adults stay in contact with their friends. Also, it gives users useful information about anything you can think of. Computers are a great tool to help us with our lives, they help us learn skills for later in life. People who use computers do not spend too much time on them, we need them to live a good life. For example, the internet has many websites that keep people in touch. There are countless sites and to name a few, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, the list goes on and on. Many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on. With computers, you can chat with each other all night. In @CAPS4, it is also a convenient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @LOCATION1. Moreover, computers are chock full of information. If a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. Also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the info for the report. Lastly if someone had an ailment and didn't know it was serious enough for a visit to the doctors office, they could look it up on the internet. They also have many sites for that sole purpose such as @ORGANIZATION2. Lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that those who don't will never have. Just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college. For instance, making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard. In @CAPS4, typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. And using the computer fine tunes hand-eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 say that staring at a screen all day isn't healthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. Computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. The time has come to tell the people computers are useful to society. They help social lives, teach us skills and, give us information on countless topics. People need them to have an enjoyable life. So, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @DATE1 and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them.
1721	1725	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where nobody has any hand-eye coordination @CAPS6 they try to catch a ball it slips away. There are no friendships or communication with other countries. Is this really what you want? Computers do have positive effects on people. For example, they help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers have a positive effect on people and the society. First, hand eye-coordination is not something that all people have. However, you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact. Computers @CAPS4 said that computer help @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 with their hand-eye coordination. For example, my mom used to have horrible hand-eye coordination but now that she uses a computer for her work and plays simple games, it is much better. Oprah said, ì @CAPS6 I was young I couldnít catch a ball but now that Iím older and using computers Iím the best.î @NUM1 out @NUM2 people agree that computer help hand-eye coordination. Next, computers help other people learn about faraway places. For example, if we didnít have computers people wouldnít travel to @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 agree that they would never travel if it werenít for computers it is a fact that people use the internet to learn about other countries for educational purposes. Www.exploretheworld.org wrote that @PERCENT2 of the people who use the website are students researching for their projects. Computers help other people learn about far away places. Finally, computers allow people to talk online. @PERCENT3 of people on facebook have at least one friend who live out of this country. It is a fact that countries are better allies @CAPS6 their people get along.Www.internationalfriendships.com wrote that they have over @NUM3 users who talk with people from other countries for example, my friendís mother was born in @LOCATION2 and she talks online with many of her friends there every week. Dr @PERSON1 said,î@CAPS8 friendships are the best kind because you learn about other cultures.î Computers are a wonderful way to talk to other people. Now @CAPS3 a world where every country got along because of online friendships. Where adults could play a game of baseball because they got their hand eye-coordination back. Where students could learn about distant places they didnít know existed. Does't that sound great? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allow people to talk online. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers do benefit the society.
1722	1726	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you know that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? Computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. Computers are taking away family time, exercise privledges, and time spent on school on school work. ""@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!"" @CAPS4 mom's will say this to childeren at least once as week, the answer that is @CAPS4 common is ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 childeren from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer weather it's playing games or talking with friends. This is on issue that needs attention. Families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother that is always playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with @PERSON1 play computer. Aport from spending time with family computers take away @CAPS6 kids exercise privlidges. One example is that last week it snowed and I wanted my neigbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me but, she said had to finish a level on a computer game and it was realy important. This proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise. A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to @CAPS4 people except for @CAPS4 teenagers would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actualy spending time with them. Lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen. When does homework got done? I took a survey recently among the eighth grade and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of the people that don't do their homework are due to spending too much time on the computer. In my science class a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. I asked him why one day and he says it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. @CAPS5 time spent with family, @CAPS5 exercise getting done, @CAPS5 time to play outside, and missing homework assignment are alot to sacrifice for ""@CAPS8 one more level."" I you want to help me get childeren not spend so much time on computer, write on artical on this important issue in one of your newspaper and please consider my ideas."
1723	1727	1	3	@CAPS1 you want people to be over weight? @CAPS1 you wat our beautifal out doors to be ruined? And @CAPS1 you want familys to be distant because they are to pre @CAPS2? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of familys dont talk because they are to preocupied with computar games. The issue to grapple with is @CAPS1 computars have an affect on people. Yes, I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enought exersize, they dont enjoy the nature that we have, and they dont inter act with there family and friends. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enough exersize. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight spend more time on the computar than on the track. I remember a time when I was over weight be cause I spent to much time on the computar. One day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and I had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize. @CAPS1 you want kids to be over weight like I was? Many people dont get to enjoy the great out doors because they are to preocupied with the computar. Lisa, a volentere worker in @LOCATION1, says This feild used to be a vast array of plants and animal life, but now it is a waste land because of computars. No one had the time to worry of the natural wonder because they were to @CAPS2 with there computar animated jobs and didnt care what came of it. @CAPS1 you want this to happen to our country? @PERCENT4 of high technological places are dirty with very little plant life because the workers need to tend to the computars rather than the bushes. Some familys have a hard time talking about their dayly lifes becuse they spendin to much time on the computar and dont spend the time to talk and get to know each other. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 ofdevorces are related to not being able to have aconversation and with more technoligy on the way that number will grow. I remember that my parents got devorced because my dad spent more time on the computar than talking to me or my mom. Most people think that computars are good for research. Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house insted of in a big library with all the information you need. I think that computars have a negitive impact on people.
1724	1728	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that there is more and more controvosy about computer and whether they benefit society or not. In my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item. I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, they allow people to stay in contact with people they dont see very often, and they allow people to keep up and know whats going on in modern life. One reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they don't see very often. Today, parents don't mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1. This feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today. People in @LOCATION1 can talk with people in @LOCATION2. This type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they've discovered. Another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life. Many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. Some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. With computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. There is even at home colleges now where you take your class online. I believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only. Finally the last reason I believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet. There are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things. Also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @MONTH1 know a lot about the topic. Another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic, read history about it, and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more. Overall, I believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years. I believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge, the ability to keep in touch with others, and to keep in touch with modern life. I believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies. So, most people in a couple years will be computers and use them effectively.
1725	1729	1	3	Computers have gotten more advanced over time. They have even gotten smaller and smaller, and yet people still don't understand the dangers that computers have on society and their personal life such as; stress, addiction, and cyberbulling. I am here to write about how computers are a nuisense in our lives. First and for most, computers are one of the laeding causes of stress in daily life. About four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers. For example, if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes, would you be upset? Would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window? I'm pretty sure that you would because your data is lost, you will have to restart your computer and, worst case senerio, take your computer to the electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus. Hacking was @CAPS1 become a world wide sport. There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer and the government can't do much about that since the first amendment gives you the write to publish what you (freedom of speech and press). Just look what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors will cause major stress in you daily life. Secondly, people spend too much time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer. This make them less social meaning they won't spend time with friends, family, or even try out for sports. They won't get the recommended one hour of exercise a day, which is detrimental to their health and social development.
1726	1730	1	3	"Many people debate on whether on net computers have negative effects on them. I believe computers have negative effects on them. I believe computers are an asset to society because you can access almost anything. That is the problem. The content on computers is affilicted upon everyone that sees it, Computers also don't help people get healthir, anf if you need to research something books are more help than the internet. For starter, the contents on computers and the internet are too much for people and society. What I'm saying is way too much can be accessed on the internet. Derrogatory and pornagraphic websites harm people the most, especially children and teens. Chinese government officials have cut off access to the most dangerous websites. Chinese readers started ""to belive the things that are easily accessed on computers are poisoning the minds of the youth."" The internet and computers are a loaded weapon waiting to explode and invade the minds of everybody. Secondly, computers aren't metally from computers but physically unstable also. Computers offer a vast selection of games for children to play. These games start off fun but they become habits. Don't get me away though games can be fun but when a child plays a game for hours a day there is a problem. The problem is that kids are not getting enough of the exercise they need. Studies performed by the American Medical Association know that a significant percentage of child who play computer generated games are overweight. Therefore I believe games are harmful habit to young children. Lastly, many people do research on the internet. but some facts are actually wrong. The point im getting is that no one need a computer to look up or do research on projects. Instead go to a library. Many find books boring but it will help in the long run. I remember a time when i had a project dure for history class in seventh grade on ancient Rome. I looked up information on the internet instead of using a book just to learn that the facts were actually highly in accurate. Therefore, never depend on the internet as a source of research. from derragatory content, to unhealthy youth, to innacurate research. Computers are not assets to society but issues. In my opinion i believe computers are actually doing more harm than good to everbody that uses them."
1727	1731	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, ""Do people have any viruses in there head?"" Sometimes they need a maricle to pop up away from the computer. Why I stated that is because its unhealthy for many people. Its not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don't want to be in. Stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get of the computer! It's unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead he just sit there online everyday eating junk food. Another reason why its unhealthy is, as you get older your bone's get weaker and when your old you can't move lik you use to and want to. Man just think, if we didn't have a computer, all the time/money people spend on computers can be spent for stuff more useful. For example nine out of ten people love computers more than life itself. Only a small percentage of the world spend their time doing somthing active instead of being on the computer."" Sure an computer is nice but you got to know that you, can't get controlled by it. ALERT! ALERT!!! Sirence is getting closer and closer to my house. I am getting scared because I am online and i'm wondering if i did anything wrong. But it wasn't me who the cops was coming for, it was my next door neighbor. I guess he was doing illegal stuff online that he had no buisness doing. See computer's can get you into trouble. For example, I remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me. Now, you know why computers effect people. How unhealthy it is, to many people. Why it takes up so much time from people's life. And all the trouble it puts people through."
1728	1732	1	3	Dear readers, Computers are a major part in everyday life. They are used by just about everybody. There are so many benefits if you know how to use one propurly. They help you through everyday life whether your trying to find this song that is stuck in your head or trying to file you taxes, computers are a nececity in every house hold. They are also a great way to learn. You can look up a question that has been buging you or you could learn to play a new song on your favorite instrement. Either way your learning. So I think that computers deffinetly have more of a positive effect on society then a negative one. Computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends. Some computers even have built in cameras that lets you hold conversations with peers through the computer while seeing each other. This is great if you have family that lives far away, or your in a long distance relationship. Another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things. Wheither it been your work schedule or your personal finances you can count on your computer to keep it all organized some computers also have a built in callendar that could help you plan out your day. But say you don't know what to do that day. Well that brings me to my next point. Computer are also great for looking up places. For instance say you fly to Paris for the first time on a buisness meeting and you arrive a few days before the meeting. So maybe you diside to go sight seeing to some of Paris's most eligant spots, but have a computer you could look up some spots and be on your way to having a great day. Overall I think that computers make the world go round. They will never die out, that is why everybody should know how to use one, and if you don't you should hurry and learn as soon as possible.
1729	1733	1	3	I think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people and even allow people to talk with other people. My first reason, is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life. The people that use computers have important jobs. For example, a judge, an enginere, a lawyer, an archytecht, a scientist, an archeologist etc... This is why I think that computer are helpfull for people. My second reason, is that computer could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school. It could help develop a smarter brain in many ways. The first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute. It helps by knowing the meaning of new words. I helps you speak correctly and clear. That is why I think that computers help develop a smarter brain. My third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world. That could be a hobby for adults that does not have something to do could have a good time exploring new cultures and ideas from their home. My conclusion is that with computer you could have a better life. Computers could help you get a better future and achieve your personal and professional goals.
1730	1734	1	3	Dear conneticut Post, you like to catch up on your favorite television showscar shop for the latest trends? Or maybe even planning out a get together with some of your old friends? Well with todays great technology you can do that on the computer! I can see that the experts are trying to decide whether or not computers are the healthiest thing that benefits our society but in my opinion I think they are great! As you may not know I am fourteen years old and have a twelve year old brother; we spend alot of time on the computer not just for homework. I like to shop online for discounts and sales where I know thing are cheaper than in stores. I know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games. My grandparents are older and don't watch alot of tv and read the Newspaper so the computer is great for catching up on your favorite tv shows and or the news. With these great pieces of machinery you can chat up a storm with old friends on facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. A large percentage of teens today are shopping by brand names, like: Nike, American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie. All of these clothes and designer stuff is everything we want, but half of us don't have the money. If you go on the computer you can get all of these names and items for less than the retail price compared to shopping at the mall. Computers lower the price of things we want and need. I, know that days grandparents try to have a decents conversation with their kids or grandchildren but they go right vack to when they were little. As a grandchild to my grandmother all she used to talk about was her days going through the great deppresion, but with computers she got to catch up on the news and now I can sit down with her and have a great conversation. You can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school. The kids won't be missing out! When I was in sixth grade I got my first facebook, I thought I was so could! That summer I went to camp and met all these new kids and found out that they all have facebooks. Now I keep in touch with them, with out lossing my friendships. You see, I know the scientists or experts are probably smarter than a fourteen year old girl but I know that most teenaters and parents have facebook and say its great because we connect with people around the world. So I know these experts are going to make the best dicision on whether or not computers benefit our society but please take my ideas into consideration.
1731	1735	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The issue before us is that people are addicted to computers, but I think we are not. In addition to all this, some people can multitask and do many things like hang out with their family and friends but most importantly enjoy life. In a way, computer privileges can be a part of enjoying life. Say if you and your friend have the same computer which includes a webcam, video messaging, and more. That's life; well, what I'm trying to say is that y'all can talk, see each other, and have private conversations. Computers don't always take you away from the important people or things in life. Some computers can help you; you can take school courses, learn how to write essays, learn how to read, and much more. Computers can be a success for some people. The only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself; you can't blame it on a computer. Imagine life without a computer; what would you do? How could you survive? For example, if you were given homework that you had to do on the computer and there was no way for you to do that project in school, how would you do it? Some people need computers. I think if they had thought and known we were going to get so excited about how cool our computers are, they shouldn't have put so many new technologies in our lives. Now you can probably see why I think we need computers and how they can sometimes benefit our society.
1732	1736	1	3	@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 can you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option of @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because of @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one of many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reasons include that citizens around the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a leader would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First of all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, trying to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegible students' handwriting. I can almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research, learning about different parts of the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you would say that research is a negative effect on school kids, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think of yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack of the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your monitor makes when you press send. It is kind of amazing how advanced our technology is, how you can send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter of seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put into making computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot of my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locations makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some of your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When I was five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part of every day. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a positive effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens of the world. I'm sure you, a @ORGANIZATION1 official, needs a computer to work. Although I can see why some people might oppose computers, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication. People might think computers cost too much, but you can find them for almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people around the world. I know that a responsible leader of the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree.
1733	1737	1	3	I agree that computers are helping people. To start with, computers have a positive effect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Also, they allow people to talk online from far away places. So, yes, computers are good for people. First of all, computers do have a positive effect. The computer can give someone motivation. Or it will help someone find their lost pet. Also, it could help you get a job. Plus, you can find a safe home with it. So, yes, computers do have a positive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deaf people with sites on sign language. Also, you can get information on places you will visit. This will help you learn about different countries. Most importantly, it will help kids and adults with school work or their jobs. This concludes that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for families. Also, for people who have hospitalized family members. Plus, fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though, adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a positive effect on people. They give us the ability to learn. Lastly, they allow you to talk to people you love that are far away. So, in conclusion, it is a benefit for people to use computers.
1734	1738	1	3	Dear readers, People around the world are starting to use computers now more often, but there are also people that don't agree that it benefits society; I am not one of those people. I agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is because sometimes there are teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they can't contact them in any other way. Another reason is because in all schools, teachers give their students projects to do over vacation or weekends, and for the projects they can look for information on the computer. The last reason is because computers can give the ability to learn more about things they didn't know before. In my opinion, I agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids, and even adults would like to talk with their friends, so they can get on the computer and chat with them if there's no other way to contact them; it's easy. You only have to get on the computer, get into a site where you know your friend might be, log in or register if you have never been on that site, and last but not least, look for your friend to chat with. Teachers always give their students work, for example, like projects. Kids also do projects on weekends or vacation, and so you don't have to go to a library to check out a book; you could always get on the computer and look for the information you need there. Computers give you the ability to learn information you didn't know before; for example, if you're bored and you don't have anything to do, get on the computer and look up information about things like nature, books you're looking for, etc. I agree with computers benefiting society, but not everyone does. The reasons why I agree are that kids can chat online with their friends, look up information for projects, and find information they never knew about. What do you think, am I right or wrong?
1735	1739	1	3	"Dear State Legislator, Can you imagine living back a long time ago when there were no computers? The only difference now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder? I definitely think that computers are making your job and everyone else's life easier. With the computer, it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I believe the advanced technology of the computer is definitely helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand-eye coordination. As you know, hand-eye coordination is necessary for a good driver. The recent statistics that came out from ""@CAPS2 drivers.com"" show the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact, it decreased by over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids, it is improving kids' hand-eye coordination starting at a young age. With games like ""@CAPS3"", a majority of kids are riding bikes, skiing, or snowboarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand-eye coordination. Lastly, the resources that help with hand-eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pace. Secondly, the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personally use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school have helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add that using the computers, our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pals. The computers have definitely helped my school's curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to business partners, friends, etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch, as found in ""@CAPS4-tech"" magazine. I should also add that it has reconnected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school, all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is video chatting, which many people are now using for business meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day, you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in your office. The computers help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and let people talk to each other online. So do me a favor, State Legislator, realize and come to terms with how much society needs the computer."
1736	1740	1	3	I think computers have a good effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and allow them to talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. This will be used through out people lives. Without hand-eye coordination people will be clumsy. Hand-eye coordination is used from day to day everyday. Using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time, moving the mouse to click on specific icons. For people who do not have good hand-eye coordination this will be a big help. They will be able to do more thing without messing up. Like hitting a baseball! For kids who want to play sports this could actually help. They will learn to use there eyes, arms, and hands to there advantage. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places. If we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world. Also if you have family in a faraway place you will be able to look online and see what is happening there. If something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them. Also to be able to learn about faraway places will help in school. If you have a report to do on of faraway place instead of looking through books you can look on the internet for information, finding pictures and videos too. Computers also allow people to talk online with other people. This gives more communication. You will be able to make more friends and better friends. To have the opportunity to talk to people online is great. You can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot. Also you will become a lot more interactive with people. If you are a shy person this can help you. You will get used to talking to people and when you get comfortable you will talk to them in real life. This will make you a lot more friends. This will help you come out of your shell and become a lot more interactive around people. These are three reasons why I think computers are a good thing. They help hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and allow you to talk online with other people, making life more connected and informed.
1737	1741	1	3	Dear, local newspaper, do you like computers? I do, computers help you learn about all kinds of things. Plus computers let you chat to people on there computer even if you can't call them. Another reason why I love computer are because when I have to write a project I can just type it!!! Computers make everything easier. So, please consider liking computers. Initially, imagine you have a project due in two days. Your mom can't drive you to the library and you have no information on the subject. But hey, don't you have a computer. You can use the computer to look up your subject and a bunch of different websites will come speed quick to your screen. Most of then will help you learn about the subject and then you have time to finish it and hang out with your friends. Secondly, oh no!!! you forgot what page of the book your suppose to read. Also you lost all your friends contacts. Not to fear super duper computer is here. You can email or chat to your friends online and see what pages to read and get there phone numbers back. Did you know ninety out of one hundred People said that the chat & email programs are great because they can contact friends, family, and co-workers. Finally, you can type your essay on the computer. Writing a five paragraph essay takes to long, so use your computer to help you out. Go to microsoft office and type your essay. Computers make writing an essay really easy. Eighty out of one hundred people said they like typing on the computer more then writing it on paper. in conclusion, Computers are great technology when you have to chat to someone. Also when you learn about something. Another reason why computers are great is because you can type essays & papers, so, please change you opinion of computers are bad to computers make us happy!
1738	1742	1	3	To whom it may concern; I am writing this to let you know how I feel about the effects computers have on people. My opinion on this topic is; I think that both statements are true, yes they give people the ability to learn about faraway places & people & also allow people to talk on line with others. If we did not have computers I would not have finished many of my school process and homeworks. But the experts say people are spending too much time on their computers & less time exercising enjoying nature & interacting with family and friends. I know this is true because I know some people who have gotten addicted to online video games & wouldn't leave the computer for hours & I know I myself have found new website & want to learn all about it so I'll be on the computer instead of exercising. But even with both statement being true; I do not think computers have a bad effect on people. Because without computers a lot more students would be failing classes & getting zeros and F's on projects; class assignments & homework. Because they don't have a quick way to look up all their information. Also most families or friends will lose contact because they lost a fun way to communicate, like through video calls and instant messages. i think computers have a positive effect. Don't you agree?
1739	1743	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I believe that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the virtual pets you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like educational ones. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assignment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for helping kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called video chat or social media. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use internet know that people need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone doesn't want to be bothered then don't bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privileged for a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids and not that bad at all.
1740	1744	1	3	"Dear Local newspaper, do you have a computer at home you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life, they help with many things. Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I truly believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: ""I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay organized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, those work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and organized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without erasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch allows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squiggle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get programs to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you might not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are due, ext. No more, ""I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to say what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a doubt, no more, ""I'm bored"". Do you use your computer to do anything like this? If so you must enjoy it. People use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings. Now what side are you at, for or against them?"
1741	1745	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Just a few decades ago, computers didn't exist, but now many people are having internet in their homes. But to some, the effect its giving on the people is negative. However, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. Such as, the internet allows people to keep in touch, gives them technology skills to prepare them for more hi-tech jobs; and allows them to find and learn about new things. Dont you think computers help society? People live in all parts of the world, and those that are lucky get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country. But, you can't talk on the phone due to long-distance calls; so with a computer people don't have to lose touch! Its quite easy for people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them, using email or social media. Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family, too. Therefore, people can talk to their distant relatives from all over when you don't even have to go visit them. Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch. Lets face it, the world is relying more and more on technology and computers. But, if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job. Lots of jobs ask for technological skills in order to be hired; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults for life. Besides that, there is a computer injust about every work place that is up-to-date; restaurants, hotels, retail stores. and even in construction business. Nevertheless, computer skills aren't just a good skill to have; they are a necessary skill. Last, Computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics. Instead of looking through various books and encyclopedias for researching, why not search the topic? Although, the computer and internet shouldn't completely replace books, it is a valuable researching tool. Someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures, ancient history on them, and learn so much. Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house. Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people. For the reasons of keeping intouch, giving essential job skills, and providing a vast resource for learning, it is clear that their benefits are substantial and impactful for modern society.
1742	1746	1	3	"Computers can take a lot of a person's time, but there are also significant benefits to having one. You could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor. The computer is the smartest thing youll ever see. All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your facebook, twitter, or myspace and tell them your running late. It's the modern era, no one writes letters anymore; there's e-mail and instant messaging. Letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over. When you type, all you do is hit ""backspace"" and you write over only your mistake. Letters also take forever to recieve, while instant messeges come, well, instantly! Haven't seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are being made with webcams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be talking with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor. Don't think that's enough? If you explored the computer, then you'd find it can help you with a lot more than just learning and interaction, making it an indispensable tool for modern living."
1743	1747	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don't have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can't do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can't. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect, providing valuable skills for both school and personal life.
1744	1748	1	3	Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don't fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines and we can lead healthier, more connected lives.
1745	1749	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think that computers are great for researching things like for a car or sereach for people places and thing. Computers are great because you keep in touch with you family and friends. Like you can email them webcam chat and you can instant message them.I think a lot of people should get into computers because you can do everything on them. You can save you picture, download music, play games. People say that some people spend to much time on the computer well i think they should because they should learn new and different things about different countrys city or even states. I don't think there is noting wrong about spending time on a computer, as it opens up a world of information and connection that was previously unimaginable.
1746	1750	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, People all around the globe are using computers! Some people think this is a bad idea but I disagree. I believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style. Computers help people stay in touch, computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways. Computers definitly help people keep in touch. There is @CAPS1, myspace, twitter, facebook, email, and even video chat. For example, my cousin is in @LOCATION1 a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat. Without this, we would have no communication with him. Many people around the world use computers to communicate with family and friends far away. This is how people use computers to stay in touch. Also, computers are amazing now and they're only going to get better. If computers are so great now, just imagine what they will be like in @NUM1 or @NUM2 years. Plus, the more people buy and use computers the more company are going to want to invent new ones with faster processors and better software. As you can see computers are only going to get better. The last reason I would like to share with you today is that computers help kids tromendously. On average, about @PERCENT1 of kid in the @CAPS2.S use a computer every day. Kids use it to talk to friends, play games, do homework and to do many other things as well. Also, kids and adults just use computers if they need to know how to do something or even find places in their town. This is how kids are helped out by computers for both schoolwork and social connection. As you can clearly see, computers are used all around the world for many different reasons. They help to stay in touch, they're only going to improve, and the help kids. Everyone is using computers, shouldn't you?
1747	1751	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly belive that computers don't benefit society as much as people think. I think that nature can provide all of the same qualatys than any computer can. A computure can not provide fitness, real interactions with friends of family, or experience in the real world. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children in @LOCATION2 are overweight because of a lack of exercising? Acording to @CAPS1 @PERSON1. a @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1, computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise. So why would a system that leads to obesity be considered a benefit to sociaty? Anotherthing on that topic is that overweight children that spend @NUM1 hours. Put off healthy activatys such as basketball or tennis wich also leaves them socialy behind and lacking he healthy experiences wich leads me to my next point. People think that computers know everything, but the truth is that their are vary little things you can experience on a computer. For example you @MONTH1 read about world war @CAPS2 but you realy know what people were thinking or what the combat fealt like? A computer can not teach you how to feal only a real life experience can do so. Many if you were deployed to an army write in @LOCATION1. You would know what its like to be in war. but playing a game or reading an article don't provide experience. My @NUM2 explamation for how computers are not the greatest affect on scociaty is true life interactions with your family and friends. Their is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally. People claim that they talk to their friends and family over the @CAPS3 all the time but the only why to be satisfied is by seeing them for real for example a romantic relationship would fail if the only way they communicated was threw the @CAPS3. Unlike most relationships that sucseed. I hope my letter to your newspaper will get peoples attention, I would apretiate it if you joined my cause and help protect scociaty from dangerous computure technology that could cause, obesity, bad relations, and inexperience.
1748	1752	1	3	"Computers are great technology, but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives! Computers cause children to fail and lose their exercize. The children also put their self in danger by joining a few different websites. Donít waste your time in a boring computer screen! I am almost @PERCENT1 positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their back packs in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. My mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @CAPS1, when he would only go one @NUM1 minutes a day to talk to family members. Now, my mom created a @CAPS1, that @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was gona only go on to with the family, but @CAPS2 plays all the pointless applications, such as, ""cafe world."" @CAPS2 waste her time on @CAPS1 whenever @CAPS2 is home, when @CAPS2 could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. Something I havent mentioned is, I use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didnt go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I relized after I got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. My dad then disconected my @CAPS4, and I beleive my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconecting the @CAPS4, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @CAPS3 home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, ""blogtv.com."" were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing! Stop wasting your life people! Go out and have fun, dont let the @CAPS4 keep you home. The @CAPS4 is unsafe and pointless."
1749	1753	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer? Too many is my geuss! They are warping the minds of people all over, and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, and say that computers help children who are in school. That @MONTH1 be true, but honestly only a couple decades ago the average student didnt even own a computer, and school were teaching the same materials without the usage of them. Also, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays by copying information from the internet, and I'm sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools. Another reason computers @MONTH1 not benefit society is because of the dangers of them. Sexual predators sworm the internet, and many people talk to strangers over the internet that @MONTH1 be harmful, without even realizing it. A third reason computers @MONTH1 not be help society is that they discourage real human interaction and connection. @CAPS2 you can see, I feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society, for many reason. I hope you can agree with me that we should be more cautious with this technology.
1750	1754	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like @CAPS2 you were to write rection on computers. They teach @LOCATION3 faraway places, help build hand-eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk online. Computers are part of everyday life and needs to be told about. First, computer let @LOCATION3 learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. One of my mom's friends, They decide to move to @LOCATION2 she didn't like computer so didn't look at @LOCATION2's laws saying, I'll find out when I got there. ""@CAPS2 did find out the laws she didn't find enough cause cause she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few monthes after her last arrest she came back to the @LOCATION3 where she could deal with the laws. @LOCATION2 is a buetifull country and all of arrests were accidents because she didn't know the laws. Ten minutes on computer searching the laws in @LOCATION2 could have kept her in @LOCATION1. Next, comptures improve hand-eye coordination. From a survey @PERCENT1 of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. @PERSON3, a gym teacher at the @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 of these kids that spend time on the compture are weak and need to get some exercise."" However, @PERSON1, a professor of the human body at @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Technology helps hand-eye. Many who use computers more than others to be greater at @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and games along those lines."" This shows how hand-eye and exercise is linked to computer. Furthermore, computers help @LOCATION3 talk with other people. When a child goes to college they will still be able to email their famlies and talk to them. Talking with others by computers makes the world go round. World business need computers to contact eachother to decuss plans on how to move toward economicly. Lastly, computers are useful and should be useful more. They teach @LOCATION3 of faraway places, improve hand-eye coordnation, and let @LOCATION3 talk to other people. @CAPS2 an article is made to show the pros or computers, more people will experience the wonders of them."
1751	1755	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are used everyday by millions of people. I believe that the technology of computers have a positive effect on people. I think computers have a positive effect on people because people use them for research, such as for school projects or learning new skills. People use computers to communicate with people far away, keeping in touch with family across the country. Computers are even used as a news resource, providing instant updates. In my opinion, computers make things easier. Computers have a positive effect on people because they are very helpful. You can use computers to research different things. If you have a computer, you can learn new things about places you never knew existed. For example, if you have a homework assignment, you don't have to use a book to get information, you can just use your computer. So, for those reasons, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are always being used for several things. However I think people used computers the most for communication. On a computer you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states. Instead of sending letters to people by mail, now a days people use e-mails and instant message. You can talk to people faster this way and it's much easier. Computers have a positive effect on people. It makes some things in life much easier. I don't understand why they would have a negative effect on people. It's the year 2024, and computers are used for basically everything. Remember how we used to have to read the newspaper to find out about breaking news and important things? Well, since we have computers a lot of people don't read newspaper. On the computer you can read the whole newspaper, and even find out more about things that happen in our world. So what's the point of even reading the newspaper, if you have a computer? I believe computers have a positive effect on people's life because you can do anything on the computer. You can research information, communicate with people, and use it as news resource. Doesn't that make life a lot easier? So why do some people think computers have a negative effect on people? The benefits clearly show their positive role in our daily lives.
1752	1756	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Using your computer daily can be a waste of your life. Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercising and enjoying nature, distract you from human nature things such as communicating, and can also waste tons of energy. Picture yourself, sitting at your desk, talking to some friends online. Take away your computer and all you're doing is sitting there, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, except your fingers of course. Don't you think you should be doing something more useful in your life? Such as taking a walk and enjoying nature? That's what I thought. Nature is beautiful. So why enjoy it through a window next to your desk? Obesity is a problem in America. A significant percentage of adults are considered ""fat"". Why would you even think about spending your day simply sitting in a chair? Go to the gym and lose some of that extra body weight! Communicating through instant messages is so over-rated, people can't express their emotions! All they can do is send a smily face or happy face. Communication with only your friends can cause you to miss out on things. For example, lets say there is a cancelation at your work place on the news, but you didn't see it cause you were chatting with your friend. LOL? Many people don't even ""laugh out loud"" when they send that to their friends. Plus you might even go to your friend's house and instead of laughing, you'll say LOL. And instead of gasping, you say, ""OMG!"" I mean come on people, get out and really ""communicate"" face to face. So, you bought one of those new lights? Too bad you're not even saving any energy by using that computer of yours daily. Using that machine, uses about the same amount of energy in as several regular light bulbs in a few hours, so is that light really saving you that much money. Haven't you heard? The economy is bad, which means we don't have a lot of money which means YOU playing online games is wasting energy, which is wasting money. Someones going to have to work overtime this week, and it's not me. I don't think hair spray is the cause of the layer being destroyed... Computers are bad, and don't have a good enough reason to be used. They take away enjoying nature, reduce your communication levels, and not to mention, waste a lot of energy. Therefore, my point is made that their negative impacts are significant."
1753	1757	1	3	"I believe the reason why people use the computer so much is because most people might have to work on the computer or maybe even finish a project. But I understand the part when the article said ""Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less exercising"". Mostly young teens use the computer at an early age and become hooked, because there are so many things to do on the computer like download games for free and play with others. People around the world but you would think that anybody would play video games on the computer and have free time? NO! Most adults don't play games on the computer, they do work or research an article. But after that they'll continue doing their daily routine, but a lot of teens are on the computer everyday and rarely get exercise. The internet has opened a lot of new enhanced technology, over the past few years you could search up old friends from maybe old school on the web or even chat with people who you don't know from all over the world. You could have an MP3 player and buy new songs or new albums instead of going to a local store, or even shop online and have the clothes been brought to you. Over the years they would have never done that, and rent movies or buy them to have on your portable device. This convenience, however, often comes at the cost of physical activity and real-world social interaction."
1754	1758	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Imagine staying inside on a beautiful sunny day, people inside on their computers instead of enjoying the weather. This is what could happen if people are using them. I believe that computers have a bad effect on people because their communication skills will drop, people won't get enough exercise and their health can be impaired. As I mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis, will drop their communication skills. People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to. For example, if I logged onto a chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number and your name. This could lead to things such as kidnapping and even rape. Also, interactions with family members and friends may decrease. You can be playing a computer game, online, or going on youtube to watch random videos of people. YouTube is said to be a dangerous site for younger children. Kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on when click the wrong one bringing them to an inappropriate website. Finally, teenagers and adults go onto facebook and twitter. Some might say these sites may change the social interactions, but it really isn't. Kids and adults are constantly getting addicted to it. Also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal. People don't need to know when you do things in your day I have keep up this our communication skills are sure to decrease. Secondly, exercise is a problem. Doctors say that a large percentage of their patients are obese or over weight according to health organizations. Kids just sit at home and play computer games such as Sims 4 and video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them. No one really goes for walks any more either. Also, people don't go out and enjoy nature like they used to. A state representative from Colorado in the US said, ""each year the number of people are getting fewer and fewer. Pretty soon all parks are going to have to get closed down."" We don't want this to happen, do you? I know I would not. Our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced. Finally, more and more people are becoming unhealthy. A person's eye sight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer everyday. My aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work. She went to her eye doctor because her vision was becoming weaker. One of the first questions he asked was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? she answered yes. He said she would need cataracts eye surgery. This was all in result of using a computer. Finally, you could get arthritis in your hands and fingers from typing and using the mouse all the time. Many people at the age of forty are probably going to need hand surgeries from all the work they do, like typing! As you can see technology is harming your communication skills, exercise and your health. I bet you don't want your future generations like this. So take a part and contact your local newspaper today to voice your concern."
1755	1759	1	3	Dear Editor, I believe that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy a lot of people's time which could be used for other matters. The internet also contains a lot of inappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many pedophiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in America is climbing. There is no doubt that electronics play a huge role in this event. For example my brother plays on the computer everyday, so he barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also there is a lot of harmful content. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornography. Most sites don't even alert you that you need to be eighteen or older to view the content, and very little actually ask for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children and young teens. Its truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and talk. Pedophiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive, to lure young teens into meeting them in a secluded location, and to commit rape. Some victims are brave enough speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet. For these reasons I say that computers have a negative effect on people's lives because while some positive aspects exist, sadly the cons outweigh pros such as the before mentioned occupation of time, harmful content on the internet, and the danger from online predators. I truly believe that the planet would be better without computers.
1756	1760	1	3	I think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversial issue. In my opinion, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. For instance, it's not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet, from inappropriate content to interacting with strangers. Also, people spend too much time in front the computer nowadays; it's a major distraction and also a negative effect on kids' school work. It's now or never! Do we decide that computers have a negative effect? You decide! Isn't every parent's biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up as unwanted ads or links. Would you want your child viewing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like social media platforms are one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least thirteen to have an account, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that a significant number of social media users lie about their age? And it's not always a twelve year old saying they are sixteen, it could be a forty year old saying they're fifteen! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are and their intentions. Is this the kind of internet exposure you want for your children? Put a stop to this right now! More than a third of children are overweight and unhealthy. This is another negative effect computers have on people. It's a gorgeous summer day. Bright blue skies, cotton candy clouds, the sun is shining, and there's a nice warm breeze. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! Many people would rather be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would rather spend hours on Facebook. This is a serious concern to our health. People don't exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! Instead of playing video games online, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun neighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step families need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn't you agree? Did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negative effects of a computer this will. Rather than coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell their friends they have to go because they need to study. So you must! Take action now, or your child will definitely suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe computers have a negative effect on people? It's clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negatively affect children's grades. Don't wait another minute! Let's agree and do something about this!
1757	1761	1	3	"Dear Sarah, Computers are very helpful in daily activities, but computers have a bad side. Some users are addicted to their laptops or smartphones; they are away from friends and family, and they are not exercising. It is fun to use the internet but you should not use it too much! Some people are almost addicted to their devices. I can't blame them; they can charge their iPod, tweet, listen to music, play games and much more all at the same time! Computers are great, but using them too much can make you miss out on tons of activities. People almost feel, and some do, that they HAVE to go on Facebook to harvest their crops in FarmTown, or control their virtual restaurant on a game. They get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities. It shouldn't be that way, but it has become an epidemic; everybody is being sucked into their computers! People who are on their computer all day are away from their friends and family! They think, ""Oh, I haven't talked to him since his surgery; I wonder how he is! Let's see!"" They go online. You can talk to someone in just a click! Talking to someone on Facebook or Twitter is not the same as talking to them in person! It's like people think computers are a substitute for real life. Devices take people away from their friends and family and they talk only on Facebook. When people are on the computer they become lazy! A person who is a computer addict will say, ""I'm supposed to go to the gym but let me check my Twitter first!"" Two hours later then they go to the gym! People don't exercise as often as they should! When people are going to lay on the computer for thirty minutes it takes three hours! They have to sign in, chat with their friends, check their mail, look at their tweets, look at their restaurant, check out videos on YouTube and do all other kinds of things! Computers are good but have side effects: getting addicted, being away from friends and family, and not exercising. Computer addicts should minimize their time on the computer to lead a more balanced and healthy life."
1758	1762	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Many parents are worried that people are on the computer way too much and don't spend enough time outside enjoying nature or exercising. I wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer. First, kids and even adults can talk to their friends online. You're probably thinking that the kids already see their friends at school, but what if their friend moved? They could have moved to a different city, state, or even country and the only way to connect with them is by computer. They can't call each other if they are really far away; that would be a pretty big phone bill. Seventy five percent of people talk to their friends through a computer. About half of the people are talking to friends who live in another state or country. Do you really want people to lose their friends? Next, people can actually make new friends on the computer, like pen pals. Pen pals are people you write to, but they don't live in the same state as you or sometimes not even the same country. It can be an assignment at school, but you can do it on your own. If your pen pal doesn't live in the same country as you and doesn't speak fluent English, you can teach them English and they can teach you their language. Finally, there's a way for kids to go on the computer without overusing it. You could set a limit on their computer time. If someone wants to play a game on the computer instead of going outside, you can play on the computer for a set time. If the child wants to go on the computer the next day and throws a tantrum, the parent should take the computer away for the next day, and so on. Once your child finally cooperates, they will get the privilege to use the computer. As you can see, there are many things to do on the computer, from talking to far away friends to making new friends, all while maintaining a computer schedule. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter and consider a more balanced view.
1759	1763	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper: Did you know that over half our nation owns home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect because they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling opportunities. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and school. Students keep their essays, study guides, and homework updates on files in the computer. Offices would not be able to function without computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interview with a student from the local high school says, ""I use my computer for everything; I would not survive the workload without it."" When asked why, he replied, ""It keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics."" A lawyer said, ""You cannot support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a computer is one of those tools."" Clearly, without computers offices would crumble and students' grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper without a computer? Secondly, internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as 'Facebook' and 'Twitter' allow people to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. A large percentage of the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and a majority of the nation says their friend groups have expanded to online groups, according to a poll taken. A psychologist explains, ""Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; they bloom online."" Without the internet, citizens in our town would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however, is even greater. Lastly, without the internet, people would do far less traveling. The internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation tickets to their destination. It also is an easy and effective way of booking where the tourist shall stay. A poll taken by major airports shows that most travelers book their flights online and without online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearably long; or stop travelers completely,' according to a quote from a worker. My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed numerous people. We inquired about how they bought their tickets and a vast majority of them said online. ""What do you mean, how? On the internet of course! No one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!"" said a person interviewed. Airports make money for the local government, and without the internet fewer people would travel. Therefore, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing, and better ways of booking transportation. Without computers and internet access, our businesses would crumble, and then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me on the essential role of computers."
1760	1764	1	3	Dear Editor, The advancing technology is showing a very negative effect on people. Because of computers, people are spending too much time on the computer and less time doing things that are better for them. First, spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways. For example, looking at a bright computer screen for more than thirty minutes at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. The brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision over time. Also, if you spend all of your time indoors and on the computer you will not get the exercise you need. Editor, were you aware that for every hour you are on the computer you should spend some time outside? It is very important to get fresh air, sunlight, and exercise for your physical well-being. Moreover, another problem with computers is that you don't get as much interaction with people. With online chatting you can't know what the other person is feeling like, Editor, or if you are even talking to the person you think you're talking to. It is much better to interact with people in person, face to face. To have good social health you need to hang out with friends, and laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. Editor, people need to interact with real people to develop meaningful relationships. Furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people. For example, Editor, say you needed to type up an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a minute, or look something up, or talk with a friend. You say that it will only take a minute and then you will type the article. But when you stop, all of a sudden you have played for two hours. Then you have to stay up later to finish your work. Computers are extremely distracting. People of all ages have this problem of being distracted by computers and not getting work done. In conclusion, computers, although an advance in technology, have very negative side effects. Editor, I feel that it is our job to tell the people of the negative side effects of computers. It is our job to help people overcome the side effects of computers. Please, Editor, we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have on health, social life, and productivity.
1761	1765	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers are good because you get to learn about other people, like famous people that died a long time ago, such as historical figures and great inventors. Computers are good because you get to learn about other places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and Texas. Learning about other places is fun, allowing you to see pictures and learn about different cultures. Having a computer is good because you get to surf the web; you could play games, see videos, and a lot of other times you will like. You could talk to friends from far away, connecting with them easily. Talking from MySpace or Yahoo and other websites allows you to talk to different people that you met through the web, making the world feel smaller and more connected. It is a wonderful tool for communication and learning.
1762	1766	1	3	"Man has always been interested in technology, and computers are just one part of that long history. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, save trees, and allow people to learn about everything. Hand-eye coordination is a key part of our everyday lives; driving a car or writing all involve hand-eye coordination. I remember a few years ago I didn't have great hand-eye coordination and had trouble catching a ball. Nowadays I spend up to an hour and a half on the computer, and I have noticed my handwriting get neater and I can catch balls with ease now. Do you want to be the one to crash your car because you have bad hand-eye coordination? Computers not only increase your hand-eye coordination, they save trees too. Using a computer doesn't need any paper; you can read and write without using a single sheet. Since the computer, @PERCENT1 of tree cutting has stopped. Saving trees helps us stay alive, as trees put out the oxygen that we breathe in. Some say that computers are causing people to spend less time enjoying nature, but I think that if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't have much nature to enjoy anyway. Lastly, computers help people all around the world learn about almost anything. A science kid, the head scientist, says that ""with the computer we are able to tell the world of our discoveries much"" @CAPS1. @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS2 many people are laying had their die to the computer, they learn @CAPS2 many nutrition facts from the health sites"". Thanks to the computer we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed. The average person can learn about non-average things any day. There are even dictionaries on the internet with many different translations that you would normally need about @NUM1 books to do. The computer is one of the greatest technological advances to this day. It has helped our world in @CAPS2 many different ways too. Hand-eye coordination is @CAPS2 important and it is preserving our environment. If you don't have knowledge you can't get anywhere in life, and our whole world senses this is true."
1763	1767	1	3	Guaranteed, @NUM1 years from now we will still be using computers; they are probably talking to friends, doing research on something, or are typing up something for @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are wonderful and let us do so many things that we can't do by ourselves. Without computers, life as we know it would probably be way different. Firstly, computers let us talk to our friends and family, allowing us to communicate with one another without leaving the safety of our homes. See, just recently a girl in @CAPS1 went over her friend's home to do their homework together. When they were done the girl tried to walk home, and she was never seen again. With computers we can do homework with our friends without leaving our homes, which is much safer. Clearly, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Secondly, computers let us do research about stuff we don't know about, allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that may not have the information you're looking for. If I were to search @ORGANIZATION1 it would give me a map pointing out its location and the school's website where I can find out my homework for that night. As you can see, the computer allows us to do things that would take us far longer to do regularly. Without a doubt, without computers life as we know it would probably be way different @CAPS2. Computers allow us to do homework on it, whether it's research or just typing something up; it lets us do more capable things. Most of our daily homework is on the computer. Just @DATE1 we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our @ORGANIZATION1. So far in @NUM2 grade almost every night our homework is on the @CAPS3; if we were to forget to write down our homework we would have another way to get this information. Obviously, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Furthermore, computers are an advancement in technology that we use constantly. Computers let us look up valuable info on things around the world. They let us talk to friends and family around the world. They @CAPS3 help us achieve great things in @ORGANIZATION1, whether it be homework or classwork. Without them it would take double to triple the amount of time to do something. Finally, I believe that people who are against them just haven't used them in the correct manner and therefore do not see their full benefits.
1764	1768	1	3	I think the effects of the computer are bad; these are my three reasons why I think it's bad: @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time or hours on their computers; @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than be on their computers; @CAPS3, people need to use computers for a less time. These are the three reasons why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers because the screen of the computer has too much light; people can't just stop staring at the monitor and even worse they could probably lose their sight and they will end up with blindness. That's why you have to be away from the screen, but being too long on your computer is bad for your eyes. This is my @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad because the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers. The @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers because when people are on their computers too much time they just couldn't come down stairs to talk with their family or friends; they couldn't go outside and enjoy the glory of nature and the enjoyment of the outside world; and also if they had nothing to do they can just read a book, draw, watch the @CAPS4, etc. They could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers. This is my @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers. The last reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to use their computer for less time because when people use their computer for less time it is good; now they finally could be with their family and friends and spend so much time with them. It is also good for saving energy and preventing you from paying a lot of electrical bill, and also it is good to finally let your vision of the eyes to relax and recover. In conclusion, the three reasons; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer; @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computer; and @CAPS3, people need to use their computers for a less time will prove that the effects of the computer I think are very bad for our health and social life.
1765	1769	1	3	Dear editor, I think people are using computers too much and are not benefiting as much as losing from it; people are getting less exercise, not seeing nature, and not spending much quality time with their family and friends. Read on to find out more. First of all, people are not getting enough exercise. Especially children; they spend too much time on computers and are becoming over weight. America is in a crisis with child obesity, and computers have chipped into that problem. Many adults are over weight because they sit at computers and work or play games all day, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. I reason that computers are more unhealthy for us in this way. Secondly, people are not going on hikes or trips to see the beauties of nature. Earth has many things to offer, with new things to explore and discover. People could be discovering many great wonders instead of being indoors. Finding new species is something you need to explore nature for: animals, fish, plants, there are many out there waiting to be discovered. This is reason @NUM1 why computers are not benefiting us. Thirdly, family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should. Relatives you talk to over computers, why not talk to them in real life? Friends chatting online on Facebook, AIM, things like that; why not talk to each other in person and have fun memories with each other? More kids are spending time on the computer than sitting down eating a family meal together and experiencing what a family should talk about, which weakens family bonds. This is reason @NUM2 on why computers are not benefiting us. In conclusion, computers are taking over our minds and we're not getting much exercise, we are missing the beauty of nature, and we are spending less quality time with our families, which is a significant loss for our society.
1766	1770	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, no matter where they are located. Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more effective for long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe or use video chat services at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now are not even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their own time. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, ""where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment in a convenient and accessible manner."
1767	1771	1	3	"Computers, a @LOCATION1 topic if you ask me. Sure they aren't very good for you, but that doesn't mean if you use it correctly then it can be a source of life. Computers are helpful in many ways, they can be an information post. The social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world. During school kids have projects and without computers, they would struggle. Read on as I will explain in details. Computers, as you know, are one of the worlds greatest information posts. @NUM1 out of ten people surveyed said that the computers are a value of everyday life. The earthquake in Haiti is recovering now, but half the world wouldn't know that without computers so have a heart, and don't take away the most valued info in the world. Secondly, what would you say if I told you that kids are more socially retarded than ever! Well its true. Over @NUM2 of the worlds people rely on interactive websites to communicate with each other. Fact, children have more friends over the internet then ever. You don't want to be the @LOCATION1 in all this do you, known as the person who kept kids from living? I don't think so. Lastly, all people in school use computers to do projects, for instance @PERSON2 had horrible hand writing and this was the biggest project of the year. So he turned to his computer to type it, and he gets an A. But what if there was no computer! @PERSON2 would have gotten a @CAPS2 for the project. In fact teachers @CAPS3 will tell kids to type their homework and projects. @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 year kids pass my class by typing and if they wrote by hand then they would all flunk!"" @CAPS4 got the point but more importantly do you?! To sum it all up for those of you lazy enough to not read this story essay. Computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information, making friends, or doing projects. So are you gonna be the person who sits back and lets that happen or are you going to get up and stop the madness once and for all. Its your choice but think of the socially retarded, dumb kids that fail the grade @CAPS3 year if computers are taken away."
1768	1772	1	3	Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer? In this modern world, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 seem hard for you to tear away from that trusty computer screen and face life. Nearly everyone in @LOCATION1 has a computer, about @PERCENT1, and @CAPS2 is ruining our country. With all these hours wasted in the virtual world, people are lacking in exercise, leading to many problems. They are also avoiding nature outside, and losing contact with family and friends. I think that computers are causing way too many problems and perhaps, with some consideration of @ORGANIZATION1 my evidence, you could come to think the same. Statistically, the @ORGANIZATION1 is the most overweight country. One of the reasons? Hours of sitting at the computer replaces healthy exercise. @CAPS3 are all spending our lives on the computer, and sitting and clicking is not exercise. The great lack of exercise is causing health problems. Not exercising can lead to obesity, which damages joints terribly. Then, diabetes develops, taking away from the quality of your life. Finally, there is heart disease, a top killer in our country. All this from spending time on the computer? you @MONTH1 ask. @CAPS4 the amount of time @CAPS3 spend on computers is much more damaging than this. Every day is beautiful in its own way, and sometimes @CAPS2 is beautiful to us, in saying that beautiful to us (when @CAPS2 comes to the outdoors) is clear skies and a warm temperature. These days come quite often, but what does @ORGANIZATION1 do? Glance out the window and go back to texting on that @ORGANIZATION2 laptop. Our bodies need this @CAPS5, @CAPS5 @CAPS6. @CAPS3 get @CAPS2 from the sun, and without going outside, @CAPS3 don't get @CAPS2. Not traveling outdoors deprives our body of an important @CAPS5. @CAPS2 affects more than just our health, as well. Staying inside on the computer keeps us from having real experience. @CAPS3 learn things on the computer, but only virtually. What happens when @CAPS3 are forced out into the real world and can't really do anything? Everyone loves having friends and family, so @CAPS2 doesn't make sense why @CAPS3 would rather email them with trivial things instead of talking. Instant messaging doesn't really bond people, as conversations are planned out you have time to think, so the person doesn't know what the real you would say. This frays the bonds between people, and once @CAPS3 can't work together, even with family, @ORGANIZATION1 can't work together at all, and nobody wants that. Computers take away too much to be spending so much time on. Blatantly, they are bad for people. Not only do they effectively cause obesity, they fool us into thinking @CAPS3 can do things that really, @CAPS3 can only do virtually, and make close people come apart. @CAPS2's ruining @LOCATION1. A country cannot be run by the sick, useless, and isolated. @CAPS2's time to step away from the computer and into real life before @LOCATION1 gets demolished by these effects computers cause.
1769	1773	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have recently read that there are some people who do not agree with computers. They believe that people use them all the time. I disagree with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many can't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small message like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teaches hand-eye coordination that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quizzes and tests, go to school on the internet, even listen to music, that is important for us to express ourselves. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even being there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun. Many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselves to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise or go to a faraway place. So, the computer teaches hand-eye coordination, allows you to talk to others, and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it and how it can benefit your own life."
1770	1774	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers. This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are making a great impact! Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. This is useful in daily life all the time! Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented at things requiring their hands (like baseball or basketball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too. Something as simple as driving a car or doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in hand-eye coordination computers bring. This is a fantastic effect that computers have on people. In addition to the hand-eye coordination computers teach, they also help you learn about faraway places and people. This splendid information is easier to acquire thanks to the technology of computers. ""@CAPS2 I didn't use my laptop for my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report,"" says @PERSON1, a @NUM1 grade student, "" I would never finish. Books take so long and I learned so much about my topic from my computer!"" @CAPS2 you are going on vacation, You can easily research your destination's location and culture with this advanced search engine. Why wouldn't you use a computer when you learn so much from them? Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other. They have lots of ways to video chat, @CAPS6 message, and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with. ""I had to move away from my best friend last @DATE1,"" says @PERSON3, resident of @LOCATION1, ""With my computer we can still talk to each other and stay friends."" computers are definitely a great way to communicate with friends and family. Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people; and even allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing! Ask yourself this, how would computers have a positive effect in your life and daily routines?"
1771	1775	1	3	"Dear newspaper, In my opinion computers do benefit society because a computer is like a big electronics dictionary and they help our soldiers stay out of the line of fire. Computers benefit our society because they are like an electronic encyclopedia. Instead of leasing through a dictionary page by page trying to find a word, all that you would have to do is go on the internet type in Google and in the search box type in the word and every thing pops up. When i have to write a paper on someone I usually use the internet. The other day I had to write a paper on Abraham Lincoln, so I went on the internet, found a website, took notes, put them into my own words and made a works called page. I thought that was easier then finding time to you do a and then find out there  only childrens books on that person. And you can also look up places like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, or if you need to find out where a place is use MapQuest. Computers also benefit our society because they are like big cellphones with a huge keyboard. My big sister is always on the computer using instant messaging talking to her friends. This helped her learn to type. Also there are new things like online gaming where you can play games with your friend and talk to them while youre playing. Lastly computers benefit our society because they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. When I watch futureweapons I see unnamed helicopters that can be controled from hundreds of miles away. Also there is a robot used that digs out mines which saves many lives. When I interviewed Sergeant Major Johnson from the military he said, ""Soldiers use those helicopters all the time. Soldiers also love how noone has to be in the helicopters so soldiers don't have to worry."" In conclusion computers benefit our society because they are like big electronic encyclopedias, they also are like big cellphones with huge keyboards, and lastly they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. In school students use computers all of the time for writing papers and researching different things."
1772	1776	1	3	"Technology, such as computers are very big. I belive computers have a good effect on people. People that use computers mostly use it to connet with family do research, or to be neat and not write it on paper. I belive that people who donít think computer make a good effect on people shouldn't bother wasting their time using one. A large percentage of people only use computer to connect with family. Usually your family either lives far away or in another state and you dont get to see them very often. Thats why I think video chating on the computer is a good thing. Also is a family come up you could email your family members instead of calling them because they would talk to you forever. Lastley if you use myspace, facebook or twitter you could connect with old friends and not just family members. ""My teachers enjoy it when I use the computer to do my work, they said its alot neater"" said a student romano from strong middle school. Teachers perfer it when you use the computers to do your work. When you are writing a book report or you are writing a story, you would want to use,icrosoft word of something to write out your paper so it is easer for teachers to read. Also if your in science class and you need to make the chart you would want to use exal to make the chart or graph look more professional. Lastly is you wanted to do a presintation on the American Revolution or little known historical figures you would want to use a power point instaed of just reading from note cards. If people didn't have google or yahoo they wouldn't know what to do, computers are very good for research. If a student to do a presentation on something they would want to know more about it and look,the topic up. Also if your family was having a discusion at dinner and you had no idea what they were talking about you would look it up online, lastly if you just wanted to find lyrics to a song because you and a friend disagreed on something. Once again I belive that computers make a good effect on people, good for connecting with friends and family, good for being neat and lastly good for reaserching anything."
1773	1777	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers have advance a lot since they were first made. Some people see computers as a way to rot your brain, while others see it has a learning device. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to each other online. To start off, computers are bad because they can be used as a way to babysit a child. When you're on the computer you're just sitting there staring at a screen with pictures and words on it. Some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite, instead of taking the time to go outside. By growing up in an enviornment like that the children only know how to play on the computer. Kids have a lot of energy, and they need to do something productive, not play computer games and talk to their friends. All school day they talked to their friends, they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy. By using the computer as a babysitter, you as a parent are leading your child to obisity because all they do is games, and they aren't properly taking care of their body. On the other hand, computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. If your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on ancient Egypt that was do in a week, what would you do? You can't fly to Egypt and ask the local people what you want to know. That would be a waste of time and money. And if you go the library and they don't have any books, then you're in trouble. But by using the computer you can find endless information about ancient Egypt, and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to. Also, if you were going to Japan, but you knew nothing about the country you wouldn't be very confident about going. And you would feel like a tourist. But, if you went online and searched for Japan, you could find the traditions, the clothing, and so much more. Lastly, if you wanted to know more about a famous person who isn't around anymore, you could go on the computer and find pictures and what they did, how they became famous, and so on. Finally, computers allow people to talk online with other people. Say your grandma lives in Florida, and you can't call to often because your phone bill will get to high, what do you do then? You talk online since you both have computers and it won't cost you to call. For example, my grandma and grandpa both live in another state. When we call there it costs a lot because they're so far away. When they got a computer, we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on Skype. Now, not only did we talk to them, but we also get to see them too. If your friend didn't have a phone and you really needed to ask them for the homework, you could go online or on aim or facebook and ask them. You know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away people an places, and they allow you to talk online with other people.
1774	1778	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a lot of effect on people because their not getting the exercis they need coz there just exercising there fingers. And while there at the computer there not looking at nothing else but the screen and thats not good for anyones health if there just looking at a computer screen the hole time. Another reason why i think at affects people is because there not eatin wat they need to eat there just eatin something quick like junck food so they could on the computer. All are this effect stay on the computer because people either go places or have atheres might not be going out time their effects need to, leading to a more isolated and unhealthy lifestyle overall.
1775	1779	1	3	"Dear Editor, I turn on my computer. Now I hear my favorite tunes. A few clicks here and type in a word and I am watching a funny episode of ""The Office"". I go to my social media page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as I send a message to my friend in another country. These are only some things I can do on my computer. As you can see I need my computer for many things. I am all for using computers and I think they are a useful resorce. But don't stop now, I have many more reasons for using computors. Thier not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, don't Use your car!! I can't stress enough to say that if you need to talk to a friend far away don't drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long-distance calls. Go to your email, facebook, twitter, or something that will save you gas and money. Some people want to talk to thier friends in another city but they don't have any of these computer sites. Pursuade them too!! Another issue some face is, ""You need to get out and excersize."" I have only one answer. Most people don't know the right ways to excersize. Then, they end up hurting themselves. If they just went online and found out that they could do a painless, priceless, fun work out that is very effective then they would not get in so much physical and finantial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to explore more out in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn't know what you could or could not eat? Like I always say, ""When in doubt, look it up"" remember the internet. FInally, if your doing a report or something formal, you want it to look nice, right? Well, many people in the world have messy handwriting and teachers mistake words that are messily hand-writen. This shows that if you use a computor it will not only show the word you wrote but also correct it with spell check. In conclusion, there are many benefits to using a computor. Lets recap, computors can save money, time, and gas. Computars can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility. Act now!!! Show others that there are benifits to using computers, show them all the wonders of this amazing machine, That is not only a time waster but a life saver."
1776	1780	1	3	"Dear Newspaper I think that computers were one of the best things ever created. They allow you to talk to people in far away places, help you learn about career and education choices, and you are able to learn about many subjects. Computers are here to help society not hurt it so why shouldn't we use them? With computers we can talk to people around the world or in space for that matter. You might not know it but all of the communications in the world need a computer. They're not the kind anyone could go out and buy though. They are satellites, which orbit the planet from space. A professor at the university, told students at the high school that, ""A lot of every day items, such as cars and phones, all use some kind of computer."" Modern computers let people communicate with each other. In addition to letting people communicate they help millions of people make educational and career choices. Most kids that go to college don't know a lot of colleges out there. When my sister was picking what college she wanted to go to she didn't know which one to choose. She sat down and looked up hundreds of schools. After narrowing it down she had made her decision she had picked a great university, a school she had never even heard of a couple months ago. People are in this type of situation all the time. At the school a survey was taken by all the students to see what they wanted their career to be, for the rest of the week students got to experience different career options. A significant percentage of the students picked a different career after that one week. Have you ever heard the old adage ""knowledge is power""? well its true and computers are a great source of knowledge. they have many different subjects math, science, history language and much much more. people should be using this knowledge. At the San Francisco national debate a speaker said that ""computers are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places, math, and even communicating these are what computers should be used for not unhealthy games. You can learn about many new places with a computer. In fifth grade my teacher had everyone do a report on a country me and my friend found this place we had both never heard of. with the computer we found lots of information on it such as its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts surely one would agree that a computer is a great tool that should be used. It lets people communicate, helps in educational decisions, and you can learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a computer."
1777	1781	1	3	Mom!!! Did you know that the human body has only one liver!!!, Mom I didn't, where did you find out, on the computer. I recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, and enjoying nature. I don't think that they should be concerned because the computer leaves people with an open mind and teaches people new things. So the computer does a lot for people, gives them the chance to learn new things, a chance to chat with friends far away, and also expand your mind of travel. Computers can do a lot for a person's life of knowledge. Just yesterday I found out that the human body can not survive without its liver. The computer also helped me with my struggles in math, even though that's what the teacher is for she is not always there, like when I am home or away on vacation and I just want to remember some things in math. It also helps people who want to know new languages such as Spanish, French, and German. So you see a computer has a big affect on a person's life. Two days ago I did a video chat with my grandparents back in Italy it was great. After six years not seeing my grandparents they really changed, and I was starting to forget what they looked like. I never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away I was surprised. I don't know why you experts are so concerned about computer taking away people's lives look what it has done for my family. I know that if one of you experts family member went away for a long time you would miss them and want to talk. Some people love to video chat like people in the army because they get the chance to see their love ones. A two-way ticket to Hawaii, to see all those beautiful sights and taste their wonderful foods look at that waterfall where is that, In Jamaica, wow now I have to go there. The computer has shown me places that I have never seen before. The computer is a wonderful thing. So don't be concerned about us and what we do on the computer. In conclusion don't listen to the experts they don't know what they're talking about, for all we know they use the computer more than we do. The computer can teach you new things, give you the chance to chat with family and friends far away, and open your mind on travel. The computer is not a bad thing all it's doing is making life a little better step by step.
1778	1782	1	3	Dear Editor, I believe that computers are a good source of technology. The reasons which I am fighting for tell why, kids are in school more than half of the school day. Parents should be limiting their childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. To begin, kids are in school more than half of a school day. How could children stay on the computer when they're in school learning? They can't. In school you get a lot of exercise because you're always moving around. After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. Computers don't have a bad effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are, they should just take the computer away. Parents should also take their kids places more often so the child will not have to go online. Lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. If you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. Also people need computers for school work and for their jobs too! Another thing numerous people use a computer for is research and reports. We need our information! To conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider because, many other people would be shy to write this and get it published in their local newspaper! I would like to say computers are not interfering with family, friends, nature or anything of that sort. We as a whole need computers to do daily life things, without being able to go online, or save files we would be lost! So I will say again to consider my ideas. Thank you.
1779	1783	1	3	"Dear Editor, I have several reasons on why I think that advances in technology are harmful to our society is because it opens doors to strangers on the outside world. It also takes you away from family and friends. Lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet. One of my several reasons on why I feel advanced technology is harmful to our society is because it opens doors to strangers for teens, adult's and etc. The problem with this is that you never really know who's on the other side of that door, that chat room people can misguide you into thinking they're someone who they're not. For example there's a show called Dateline. This show is about how young teens put themselves online and grown or young men click on a picture of you and that opens up a chat line or as I say opening a door, you don't know who's on the other side of that door. So these men online make these teens trust them and make them feel safe then they ask ""hey can I come over sometime?"" and this young teen thinking that's your friend says yea sure. Don't forget you don't see his picture so he comes over and most of these men are looking for a quick fix. If you know what I mean. This is what goes on during Dateline t.v show just imagine how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing the difference is they don't get caught. Secondly on why it is harmful to our society is because it takes you away from your family and friends. It takes you away from your kids and family because they will start to feel as if you love that computer more than them. It takes you away from friends because they might say hey let's go out to the mall or for a drink you'll probably say you need to check up on somethings online. This will slowly move people away from you, all over a computer you will start to lose the people most important to you. My last reason on why you can harm society with technology is because it takes you away from living your own life and doing things you wanna do like online is a bunch of stuff that everybody else says is cool. Do what you think and feel is cool. For example if someone posted something saying five guys London is so cool you gotta go there but you've always wanted to go to Paris, another thing is that you don't get to have enough air outside and your skin will get pale and icky and this is why I feel that way. In conclusion although some people might think that advanced technology is good well clearly they're wrong because they open doors to danger, take you away from friends and family. Also it takes you away from what life has to offer."
1780	1784	1	3	Do adults and kids spend too much time on the computer? Well I don’t think they do. Sure they use it a lot but still it's for entertainment. Kids need to use the computer because it's another way for them to communicate with each other. Texting is good but it costs money, so does talking on the phone. If someone doesn't have texting they can go on Facebook or something to make plans to do something with a friend. What if it's a rainy day outside and there's nothing to do? Well that's what a computer is for. Kids use the computer for entertainment. There's tons of games to play. All on different websites of course but that's beside the point. There's MMORPG or RPG those are two type of games I can think of. Computers are like a kid's own virtual outside world. Computers are also needed to do research for school projects. Also to get pictures. Sure there are books but they don't always have everything you're looking for. You can't cut pictures out of books. You need a good grade on a project. Therefore computers need to be used a lot for communication, entertainment, and school projects.

People can do their work in the computer. It is also useful to teach your children how to use a computer or let them go on the internet so they can search for kids stuff. However, people shouldn't spend all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They can show their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should allot more time with their families and be happy about it when they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a visitor over their house; they don't want their visitor to think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agrees that people should use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that to happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this kind of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then paying attention to the computers. It is a question that each family must consider for themselves to find a healthy balance.

They can be very useful for work and for learning new things. On the bad side, using the computer too much can mean we spend less time with the people around us. It can become a habit that is hard to break. Some people might even forget to go outside or to talk to their family because they are so focused on the screen. Therefore, while computers are powerful tools, we must be careful not to let them control all of our time and to remember the importance of real-world interactions and personal connections.
1783	1787	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree that computers are good for society. Without computers a lot of things couldn't be done. Computers are sometimes the easy way out, and that’s why I love them. Computers almost make anything possible. Now say if you're an elderly person and you can't get up and your body is really bad, well all you need is a computer. You can pay your bills online or you can get a job online or even shop online. All you need is a computer. Computers are also good if you're lazy. You can just lay in bed all day and go online to work or to the mall and order things; all you'll have to care about is personal hygiene. Sometimes computers take a lot of stress off you. No more ignorant co-workers or no angry boss; everything is a-okay. Computers are also swell because it's the easy way out. But you have to make sure you get a good computer, not an old one because it can breakdown. That's one reason why computers aren't so good. But as I said, computers are very good; they might be a little pesky but once you get the hand of them everything is gonna be alright. Remember, you can do almost anything with a computer, making life more convenient in countless ways.
