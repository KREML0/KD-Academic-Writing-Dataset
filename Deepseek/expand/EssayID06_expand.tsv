1	14834	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen, which posed a constant risk of catastrophic failure. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated city below. Another problem is keeping the dirigible stable so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself, creating a significant challenge for a safe disembarkation. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below who could be injured by falling debris. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area instead.
2	14835	6	3	From the start, there would have been many problems with allowing dirigibles to dock some twelve hundred feet in the air. The major problem here would be that the Empire State building was being constructed in New York City, a highly populated area where the risks were magnified. Below the mooring mast would be several other buildings were other people worked and lived, creating a vast potential for collateral damage. If something happened while the dirigible was attempting to dock, it could take out the building and the lives of the people in it, a scenario the planners dreaded. Not only that, but below were the city streets, where pedestrians walked, completely exposed to any falling wreckage. In later paragraphs, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy, steel framed airship mooring at the top of the building. The frame would need to be very dense and, as the architects of the project discovered, prohibitively expensive to reinforce adequately. Other safety issues include the high winds that would drift the dirigibles off course, and the safety of dirigibles themselves, which was a known concern. The passage mentions the Hindenburg incident, as well as the worry the owners of the building had about that happening over such a densely populated area, which ultimately made the venture too perilous.
3	14836	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether, which concentrated immense force on one point. This would add stress to the building's frame and in order to make the frame more sturdy, there was modifications to the building's framework which cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant sum at the time. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable and prone to ignition. Since New York was a densely populated area, this would not work out well for obvious safety reasons. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights to maintain stability during docking. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was a safety issue and a public hazard. One last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area, rendering the entire plan legally unfeasible from the outset.
4	14837	6	3	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in the building of the Empire State Building, in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One reason is that Al Smith, a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office, had made the tower tall to secure its status. The height of the building was 1,250 ft, but after almost losing the title of worlds tallest tower he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower, which became the mooring mast. Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles, or blimps, that Could transport people from New York to New Jersey, offering a novel commuting service. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock safely, but it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937 the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York, causing unimaginable devastation. In the 1930's the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to perform a stunt and encountered severe difficulties. The Empire State Building never got to fulfill what it was made for, and the mast was repurposed for broadcasting."
5	14838	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, which presented an immediate legal barrier. This made it illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building, thwarting the plan before it could even be tested. Another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety, a primary concern for city officials. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable and difficult to control in an accident. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, there would be a good chance that many people would be hurt or killed in the ensuing disaster. A final obstacle faced was ""nature itself,"" an unpredictable and powerful force. The winds on the top of the Empire State building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents that made stable docking nearly impossible. Even though a dirigible would be attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around the mooring mast in a dangerous way, threatening to smash into the tower itself. Many obstacles were faced by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow a dirigible to dock there, and in the end, these challenges proved insurmountable."
6	14839	6	3	Soon after its conception, the Empire State Building's mooring mast was doomed to fail. Early obstacles were easily surmounted, for example the problem of added stress on the building's frame caused by the added weight of the moored airship. This was fixed by structural modifications to the building's frame, an expensive but fairly simple procedure that involved reinforcing the steel skeleton. One of the biggest blows to the project was the advent of the Hindenburg disaster. The Hindenburg disaster was the cause of the forefront of a decline in airships, as public confidence in this mode of transport evaporated. Airplanes became a safer, faster, more designer form of transportation, rapidly eclipsing airships. In addition to the Hindenburg disaster, it soon became clear that mooring an airship at such a great height was not feasible. Surging winds would not allow the airship to maintain its course and the ship would be blown erratically around the mast, making a safe and stable connection impossible. The final nail in the coffin for the mooring mast was a law prohibiting airship travel over urban areas, which legally barred the practice. These multiple factors easily disallowed any possibility of successful airship travel from the building in the future.
7	14840	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse or suffer severe damage. They strengthened the framework from the bottom of the building to the top before putting the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building, ensuring the structure could bear the intended burden. The builders were faced with these obstacles but they were successful in completing their goal of constructing the mast itself. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station but it is still looked at as the final piece that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City, serving as a distinctive architectural crown.
8	14841	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified to support the additional load and dynamic forces. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"" to test the feasibility of docking. The result of the experiment were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock securely, demonstrating a fundamental practical flaw. Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten, rendering the mast an obsolete relic."
9	14842	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the United States use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable and poses a significant safety risk. Following that they told the United States how the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen, highlighting the catastrophic potential of such a fuel. They realized if this had happened in a dense urban area it could have been even worse, causing immense damage and loss of life. Another obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at the mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the blimp shift and cause stress on the building's steel frame, threatening the structural integrity of the entire skyscraper. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly too low in urban areas, effectively banning the practice. This would keep blimps from landing there, sealing the fate of the ambitious project.
10	14843	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a great idea. They wanted to be able to tether dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building to create a revolutionary urban airport. However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy and were difficult to control precisely. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings, creating a clear hazard. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium because helium was scarce and expensive. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable, making the vessels incredibly dangerous. The smallest spark could set the whole blimp ablaze, risking a fiery disaster. The docking system itself was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side, a crude and unreliable method. One concern was that a weight could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below, potentially causing serious injury or death. This could've proved very disastrous, ultimately contributing to the idea's abandonment.
11	14844	6	3	The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first conceived, but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over-anxious to complete it, rushing the project in his eagerness to claim the title of the world's tallest building. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risks and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top the Empire State Building was already a failure. Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 foot long dirigible, as the immense force would have compromised its structural integrity. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation, threatening the entire skyscraper. So the roof would have to be re-done and the steel framework significantly reinforced in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and @NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin. Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen, not the safer helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen, caught aflame and killed hundreds, serving as a grim warning. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area, making the entire venture legally questionable. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, critical safety precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned, becoming a forgotten chapter in the building's history.
12	14845	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, there were constant obstacles faced by the builders. Architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building without significant structural changes. The massive @NUM1 ft dirigibles would add dangerous stress to the building's framework, therefore causing the architects to modify and reinforce the steel frame. This would cost them an extra @MONEY1 for the modifications, a substantial financial burden. The Architects didn't know if these modifications would even help, as the fundamental challenges remained. Safety is another primary concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable and posed a catastrophic risk over a city. For example, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects also had to worry about @ORGANIZATION2 and the constant shifting of the winds due to violent air currents, which made a stable connection nearly impossible. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down so they won't drift away, except it is impossible to weigh down the dirigible in the air. They would dangle high above pedestrians walking around on the streets, therefore making it not safe for the public below. There is also the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. @NUM2 was in December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock except it couldn't get close enough due to high velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared,"" as airplanes became the future of air travel."
13	14846	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to construct this marvelous building with its ambitious dirigible dock. One obstacle was making sure the stress of the building from the dirigible would go to the foundation of the building and not the top or middle where it could cause it to collapse, which required extensive engineering. As said in the text ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 the building had to be changed in many ways to make it stable enough for a dirigible to dock, a complex and costly process. Another obstacle was the weather above the building which was characterized by very strong winds and unpredictable air currents. This would mean that the dirigible would just be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" and that's not a safe thing to have highly flammable hydrogen floating around above millions of people. An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast, as it was an unprecedented concept for a skyscraper. This took people going to professionals like the Navy and finding out the proper way, seeking expertise from those with experience in airship handling. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building caused many obstacles to get in the way, ultimately proving too difficult to overcome."
14	14847	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Al Smith was the architect, and man behind the idea of the Empire State building, driven by a grand vision. He and the maker of the Chrysler building were competing against each other to construct the world's tallest building, a fierce rivalry that fueled the project. To make the Empire State building bigger than the Chrysler building, Smith was going to construct something that John Tauranac stated, ""Would be equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers"". That dream was to travel by blimp, a futuristic mode of transport. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of air ships, but it was not going to be as easy as the concept suggested. The architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mass on the roof because it would stress the building's frame, requiring costly and complex reinforcements. The greatest reason the mast would never fulfill its destiny was for safety, a concern that overrode all others. The excerpt states, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen"". Hydrogen is highly flammable, creating an immense fire hazard over a populated city. There was also a law that was, ""against air ships flying too low over urban areas,"" creating an insurmountable legal barrier. After numerous attempts and modifications, the idea was shelved, ending the dream of a skyscraper airship terminal."
15	14848	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area, a fundamental problem from the start. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigible's to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, via the electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. However, this process was fraught with danger. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and get passengers could safely get on and off The dirigible by walking down a gang @CAPS1 to an open observation platform, a perilous transfer high above the city streets. They of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations of the U.S. Naval Air station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, to better understand the challenges. Despite this research, the inherent dangers and technical difficulties of docking a massive, buoyant aircraft to a skyscraper in an urban environment proved insurmountable, leading to the concept's eventual abandonment.
16	14849	6	3	"The article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet ultimately obstructed ideas of attaching a landing dock for dirigibles to the Empire State Building. The obstacles that the builders had to overcome were significant. For instance, the wind speeds at the height where the dirigibles would attempt to land were dangerously strong and would whip the massive balloon around like a rag doll. To counter this, they would have to use heavy lead weights to secure the craft, which in turn posed another serious problem by questioning the structural integrity and foundation of the building itself. The immense weight of the building combined with the additional weight of the lead weights raised concerns that the entire structure might be at risk of collapse. Furthermore, the gases used for lift, namely hydrogen and helium, presented their own challenges. While helium was safer, hydrogen is highly flammable and therefore could not be safely used in populated urban areas. Compounding these issues, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. These are the fundamental obstacles and the primary reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its intended purpose."
17	14850	6	3	"In Marcia Amidon Lusted's excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" many obstacles had the engineers of the Empire State Building looking for a new way to dock dirigibles, requiring substantial modifications to the original design. One obstacle they had to face was reinforcing the steel work of the building to handle the unprecedented stresses. The combined pressure of the high-altitude wind and the dirigible's substantial load had cost the company a significant amount of money, running into many thousands of dollars. Secondly, they had to design a few special floors dedicated specifically for the passengers of the dirigibles to facilitate a seamless transition from air to land. One floor would be allocated for baggage and suitcases, while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship directly. Lastly, with the addition of the mast, the building would now be 102 floors tall and would need to be very durable, so special, stronger materials were needed to be brought in and used to create the building's framework. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many complex obstacles when constructing the 1,250 ft. building to accommodate its ambitious but impractical function."
18	14851	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there, encompassing issues such as the wind, the actual docking procedure, and ensuring people could get off safely. The actual docking process itself was highly impractical, as it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch and secure the massive airship reliably. However, the wind was the main reason for the ultimate fate of the mast. First, the wind current at that altitude was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time maneuvering and getting close enough to even attempt a connection. This was demonstrated when the captain of the Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also, even if it could somehow tie up, the back of the dirigible would swing around fiercely, creating a dangerous and unstable situation. So the builders were dealing with an impractical task from the outset, one that was fundamentally at odds with the environmental realities of the skyscraper's summit.
19	14852	6	3	Several key obstacles doomed the plan for a dirigible mooring mast on the Empire State Building from the beginning. The first obstacle was the need to reconstruct the body frame so that it could support the additional structural load of the mooring mast and a tethered airship. The second was that many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed an immense safety risk, instead of the safer but less available helium. The third reason, which should have been apparent from the start, was the existence of a law against airships flying too low over densely populated urban areas, making the entire landing operation illegal. The last reason is that the powerful wind conditions at that extreme height made it impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail end swaying violently in the wind, presenting an uncontrollable hazard. Together, these insurmountable challenges ensured the mooring mast would never be successfully used for its intended purpose.
20	14853	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there centered largely on the immense stress to the building's frame. The significant stress of the dirigible's load and the constant wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below the mast, posing a monumental engineering challenge. To manage these forces, the existing steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate this new and dynamic situation. This necessary reinforcement was a costly endeavor, with over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications having to be made to the building's framework alone. These structural and financial demands highlighted the extreme difficulties of adapting a stationary skyscraper to serve as a dock for massive, moving airships.
21	14854	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was constructing a mooring mast that would not threaten the building's structure. The immense forces involved required the builders to modify and strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building significantly. According to the excerpt ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework,"" indicating the substantial financial and engineering investment needed. Another big obstacle was public safety. At the Empire State Building's height it would have been illegal to land a dirigible, creating a legal and practical barrier. The dirigibles, at that time, were filled with highly combustible hydrogen. If the dirigible ever exploded, it would threaten the hundreds of pedestrians on the streets of New York City below, making the entire concept perilous from the outset."
22	14855	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A primary engineering challenge was managing the tremendous structural forces; as one source noted, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred Feet below."" The powerful wind currents at such a high altitude would cause the dirigible to pull and drag the building with it. The combined weight of the dirigible and the relentless pressure of the wind presented a genuine risk that the building could collapse. Concurrently, Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building would now reach the height of 1,250 Feet. Al Smith didn't want to lose his title so he decided to make the building taller, yet this decision exacerbated the wind problem, as the taller the building gets the stronger the wind current will be, adding more stress on the structure. Furthermore, practical safety measures were a concern; dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Ultimately, dirigibles should land in wide open areas where there isn't anything to harm the blimp, citizens, and passengers, especially since the gases that are used to inflate the dirigible to make it lighter than air are highly flammable. These are some of the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State building had to overcome."
23	14856	6	3	"In the reading The Mooring Mast written by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a significant obstacle, which was attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. Not to mention Dirigibles were thought of being the transportation of the future, which added pressure to find a solution. First, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This quote shows that for one this Dirigible would need to find a proper landing area, as well as not being able to fit within the confined urban space. Thus, there was some need of more area space, which Manhattan notoriously lacked. Also, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" It seems as though there was not enough space due to the Dirigible being so long, making maneuvering and docking in a dense cityscape nearly impossible. It also shows how would these architects come up with a plan in making this work, so that way it would fit properly within the city's existing grid. Therefore, the lack of a suitable area was a fundamental obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their ambitious plan."
24	14857	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. The builder's mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of blimps over one thousand feet in the air, a feat never before attempted. The first obstacle was designing a suitable landing area. This was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past, requiring entirely innovative engineering. A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph 3 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars, a costly and complex undertaking. Furthermore, ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent and unpredictable wind currents at the top of the building and the blimps were never very stable, making docking maneuvers hazardous. There were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible so this was a very dangerous obstacle, risking public safety. Lastly, the pre existing laws of airships flying too low over urban areas posed a new problem. Even with successful architecture, laws disallowed the blimps in the first place, creating a legal barrier that was difficult to surmount, especially as planes were also becoming more popular and shifting transportation priorities."
25	14858	6	3	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some significant problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles that the builder faced were actually having a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground, which was an unprecedented engineering challenge. The strong air currents and constant changing in the wind direction also made it extremely difficult for the pilots to steer the large, cumbersome dirigibles close enough to the mast for a safe and secure docking procedure. A final and perhaps insurmountable problem that the builders faced was a law that prohibited ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which basically means that if it was docked at the Empire State building, then it would be too low to an urban area and that's against the law, presenting a legal obstacle that ultimately helped doom the ambitious docking plan."
26	14859	6	3	"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a fascinating and amazing idea, one that promised to usher in a whole new ""age of transportation"" (@NUM1). Unfortunately, this wonderful idea had a few critical holes in the plans. Later, the architects who were building the mooring mast discovered that their ambitious vision was not going to be fulfilled due to a series of significant challenges. The idea simply had too many obstacles to overcome. A primary concern was the fact that ""most dirigibles outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM2). If anything were to go wrong during the docking process, the consequences would be catastrophic, especially considering the densely populated streets directly below. Also, ""the greatest obstacle was nature itself"" (@NUM3). The powerful and unpredictable winds at that altitude created a constant battle to keep the massive aircraft steady and under control. The reality was that the idea to moor dirigibles sounded great in theory, but there were far too many practical risks to ever successfully carry out the plan."
27	14860	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was ultimately destined to never fulfill this purpose due to many compelling reasons and insurmountable obstacles. One of those many reasons was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than the safer helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing an immense danger. Furthermore, the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. This was due to the reason that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a hazardous environment. Even if the dirigible were successfully tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be free to swivel around and around uncontrollably. Using these airships at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was deemed neither practical nor safe. The other major obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hard obstacles that ultimately proved too great to overcome."
28	14861	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle they faced was the critical safety issue concerning the airships' fuel. As stated in the text, most foreign dirigibles used the highly flammable element hydrogen rather than the inert helium. A fire or explosion would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York, creating an unacceptable risk. Another major obstacle the builders were faced with was the powerful wind at such a great height. The text notes that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This turbulent weather would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around dangerously and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be safely weighted down with lead weights, but doing this in open air high above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to the pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was a legal one: the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This regulation would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, creating a definitive legal barrier. This combination of dangers is why the mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State building never served its intended purpose."
29	14862	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with allowing dirigibles to land there. One of the primary obstacles were the significant safety problems involved. The dirigibles had to come dangerously close to the Empire State building so they could be able to tie the airship down, which put the massive vessels too close to the people on the streets below. There was a specific law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, highlighting the recognized dangers. The memory of a disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey, likely informed this caution as they were trying to prevent a similar tragedy from happening in New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another persistent problem that builders faced was that the strong winds of nature simply did not allow dirigibles to get close enough or remain stable enough to tie down securely to the mast. There were many obstacles builders had to face, and at the end, the risks and difficulties were so great that it was not worth making the Empire State building a dirigible dock."
30	14863	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, including significant structural and financial challenges. The existing steel frame of the building needed to be extensively modified and further strengthened to make a secure place for the massive dirigibles to dock, a complex engineering feat. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made, representing a substantial financial investment for a feature with an uncertain future. The last major structural obstacle builders had was the concern that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add tremendous stress to the building's frame, testing its structural integrity. It was not easy for builders to construct a mooring mast on top of what was then the highest building in the world, standing at one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but despite the difficulties, the architects reached their goal by successfully designing and building the mooring mast, even if it was never used for its intended purpose.
31	14864	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstacles while attempting for dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and building would add extra stress, so builders instead had to undertake over sixty thousand dollars worth of reconstructions to fix the building's framework. Dirigibles also dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and while they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that any ship could attach to the building at the high winds present at such an altitude. Other obstacles they faced in letting dirigibles dock at the building included significant safety hazards, as the hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. is highly flammable. Builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. Ultimately, the task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State building was an impossible task to begin with.
32	14865	6	3	There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were several hundred feet long and it would be too much for the urban location. There would only be a single cable tether and it would add significant stress to the building's frame. The entire steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fulfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents created by the structure. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around dangerously. They are meant to land on open playing fields, but using these at the Empire State Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians was not safe at all.
33	14866	6	3	The obstacles the builders went through included the use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed a grave fire risk. Another one is the fact that the wind on the top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable connection nearly impossible. The third one is when the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, creating an uncontrollable and hazardous situation. Last but not least, there was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the entire operation. These combined factors made the plan to dock dirigibles at the skyscraper fundamentally unworkable from the start.
34	14867	6	3	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful and unpredictable. This would make it very difficult to actually get the dirigible close to the mast for a safe connection. Also, there was the structure of the Empire State Building itself. The framework was not originally built for the amount of stress and weight that would be placed on top of the building by a docked airship. Builders made over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications for fortifying the framework, but this was still insufficient to overcome the other challenges. Those are some of the key obstacles that builders had to face in their ultimately unsuccessful attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
35	14868	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although the builders thought it to be a brilliant idea, they did not carefully consider the safety hazards they may have encountered, and how unrealistic the idea truly was. One of the greatest reasons the mooring mast was destined to be unable to fulfill its purpose was because of safety concerns. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen for lift, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When a dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse an accident like that would be if it occurred over a place as densely populated as downtown New York. Another very practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was the existence of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the area, let alone be able to tie up to the building. It is very apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable issues in the attempt.
36	14869	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building seem blind to all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast. One huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation, which could whip around the massive structure. The blimp would be swung around violently on the tether going to the building, which could either damage the building itself, or damage the blimp's fragile envelope. Also, if the blimp was moving, how would passengers get on and off safely? They could fall off the narrow loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building by a sudden gust. Another factor was the high population of New York City; if something like heavy debris or a piece of the blimp had fallen down to the crowded streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians. I would think that the architects would have considered all these significant factors before trying to begin such a risky project.
37	14870	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the construction of the Empire State Building faces many problems. One of these problems is that the governor of New York, Al Smith, wanted the building to be the tallest in the world, a goal that drove the entire project. In order to do this you would need a mast to break the record, which was added as a last-minute feature. The mast made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air currents that put immense stress on the structure. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because there was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier. This law went in effect because of a German dirigible that caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, highlighting the inherent risks. Those were just some of the many problems the dirigibles faced while passing the Empire State Building, making the plan ultimately unworkable."
38	14871	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A one thousand-foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would add tremendous stress to the building's frame if the dirigible was placed at the top of the building. The building's frame would have to be strengthened and modified extensively to accommodate the situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework, a substantial cost. Some other obstacles builders faced was the safety of the volatile hydrogen gas. The dirigibles ran on hydrogen which is highly flammable, creating a fire hazard. Another obstacle was the unpredictable weather. The winds shifted at the top of the Empire State building were shifting due to violent air currents, making docking nearly impossible. One last obstacle was an existing law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, creating a legal blockade. The idea of a dirigible mooring mast quietly disappeared as these challenges proved too great.
39	14872	6	3	Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be unique and practical, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified and reinforced with steel. This cost over sixty thousand dollars in structural upgrades. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen—a highly flammable and dangerous gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City, risking countless lives. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would make docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured and crash. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area, rendering the mast useless from the start.
40	14873	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the powerful and unpredictable wind. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a hazardous environment. The strong winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel wildly around the mooring mast, threatening to smash it against the tower. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to moor at the Empire State Building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas, a regulation put in place for public safety. This would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately dooming the ambitious concept to failure.
41	14874	6	3	It all started when they built the Empire State Building, and the workers should have known that the building was too big for the wind climate up in the sky. Plus, when you make a building like that, you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep its balance against such powerful forces. They faced problems like when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them, proposing to use the top of the building for a dock to let civilians disembark from airships. However, after they made a law that no more blimps could land on the dock, a blimp nevertheless attempted to land on the structure, highlighting the persistent and dangerous allure of the idea despite the known risks and legal restrictions.
42	14875	6	3	Obstacles the builders faced included the concern that if they put a mooring mast at the top of the building, it would add significant stress to the entire structure, and they would have to modify the building's core design to support the additional load from the mooring mast. Another problem they considered was safety, since most airships at the time were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable and poses a tremendous fire hazard. If there was a fire, it could lead to a massive loss of life due to the fact it's a densely populated area surrounding the skyscraper. Nature itself also seems to present a major problem, as the winds above the building were very violent and unpredictable. Then there's the law where airships are prohibited from flying too low above urban areas, creating a final legal barrier to the plan.
43	14876	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. One significant obstacle was that most dirigibles were highly flammable, posing a grave danger. In the text, it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught on fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would affect many people since it's a densely populated area, leading to potential catastrophe. Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself, which were fierce at that altitude. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much, and as noted, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" One more obstacle they faced was an existing law that directly forbade the practice, as stated: ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The architects faced many obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality, demonstrating that it is better to plan ahead and think of every obstacle before bringing ambitious ideas to life."
44	14877	6	3	The builders had a very hard time because of where the Empire State Building was located in the dense urban center, and how the dirigible was supposed to dock at such a great height. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, it was inherently hard and dangerous for workers to perform tasks on the mast. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling on the building with considerable force when moored, so the entire structure had to be reinforced to withstand this constant strain. The final problems that made them a most unreliable choice were the unpredictable wind conditions at that elevation and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely, creating an uncontrollable hazard. These significant issues all contributed to make the mast on the Empire State Building a fundamentally bad idea from the start.
45	14878	6	3	"From the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the architects building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced was the powerful and shifting winds at that altitude. As it says in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" This meant the dirigible would not be stable and could easily be thrown against the building. Another obstacle they faced was the method of securing the airship; to weigh it down, they'd have to use heavy lead weights, but it wouldn't be ""practical nor safe"" dangling high above people in a city like New York on the street. Overall, the architects faced a lot of obstacles for docking the dirigibles, most being either impractical or dangerously unsafe for the public below."
46	14879	6	3	There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirigible, the building's frame would be under tremendous stress, requiring significant and costly structural reinforcement. They also noticed that the dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which presented a grave safety risk over a densely populated city. A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting, creating violent air currents that made docking maneuvers perilous. Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prevented them from approaching or tying up to the building. With the combined factors of weight, gas, nature, and law, the builders of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles for the plan to succeed.
47	14880	6	3	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the text tells about the original purpose of the mast on top of the Empire State Building, which was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles. Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building's structural integrity. In order to get around this, they put additional framework around the entire building's frame to help distribute the load. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was too great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around dangerously. Finally, there was the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen gas it used, which would have been a catastrophe over New York City. In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements and safety concerns, the mast had too many flaws to be a practical reality."
48	14881	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was modifying and strengthening the frame of the building. It says that ""over several thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" in order to accommodate the immense weight and force of the dirigibles. However, after the modifications were made, the builders had to face another set of obstacles, more serious than before. The first one was ""safety"": the fiery destruction of the Hindenburg in New Jersey raised public fear for a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle was ""nature""; the strong winds and violent air currents on the top of the Empire State Building made docking dirigibles ""neither practical nor safe"". The third obstacle was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles attempted a few moorings, but unsuccessfully, and the entire idea of dirigibles using the building disappeared by the late 1930's. These are the significant obstacles that the builders faced in their ultimately failed attempt to have dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building."
49	14882	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a number of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. The greatest obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. The author stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" therefore it wasn't safe for dirigibles to be docked there. The wind would cause them to swivel around the mast, and it would be unsafe for the builders to hang lead weights on the dirigibles because they would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street. The other obstacle which prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building was due to the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities. This existing law made it illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the building or just approach it because the area was too low over the city. The author noted that ""although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."" These two dirigibles failed at getting close enough to tie up or to deliver their cargo safely, because of the forceful winds and the non-existence of certain essential mooring equipment, which should've been installed. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, dirigibles were never able to successfully moor at the building."
50	14883	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith, was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest, Smith was said to have announced a new plan for a mooring mast, ensuring ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"". Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles could be docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"", which would have made the builders completely alter the building's internal structure. Another reason was safety. At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium, which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacle for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there were wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel uncontrollably. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there, a decision made for the safety of all New York City inhabitants."
51	14884	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @PERSON1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with that should have been apparent before they built the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" It says in ""The Mooring Mast"" that at the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a highly unstable environment for any large, lighter-than-air vessel. Also, if the dirigibles were tethered, the back of them would move around wildly while the dirigibles would also be high above the city with people watching, a situation unsafe for many. Furthermore, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" presented a legal barrier. It's illegal for a ship to tie up with the building or to even go to an area like that. These things should have been brought to the builders attention with obstacles such as nature and lawbreaking are in play, highlighting fundamental oversights in the initial planning."
52	14885	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in their plan to incorporate a mooring mast for dirigibles. They needed to make plans that were very difficult and hard to execute. Firstly, the structural integration was a major challenge. The builders needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building, requiring them to make significant changes to the existing architectural plans to properly fit the mooring mast. Secondly, the risk of accidents was a serious concern. The Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash into the building, especially since blimps fly about @NUM1 miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it upon impact. Lastly, the mast was very high, which presented its own set of difficulties. It would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast safely, a point underscored by Irving Clavan, who said, ""... Such a height made it desirable to postponed to a later date for the landing gears."" In @CAPS1, the builders indeed faced a lot of obstacles, from the difficult plans and the risk of crashes to the excessive mast height."
53	14886	6	3	"Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly weather and safety concerns. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This means that because of the wind and air currents always shifting, the dirigibles would be hard to control and maintain a stable position at the mast. Another significant obstacle they faced was public safety. Also in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" @CAPS1 that means is having something heavy dangling above people is not a good idea and poses a clear danger. It wouldn't be a good idea because if the weight were to disconnect from the dirigibles, there is a serious possibility that somebody on the street below could get injured badly. Those obstacles related to unpredictable weather and public safety are what the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock."
54	14887	6	3	Throughout the process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual construction process. Because the mast would add too much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the builders had to reconstruct the steel frame of the entire building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time consuming project. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building had to do with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast which was very unsafe for both the airship and the building. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be a legal obstacle because the ships would never be able to actually approach the area without violating regulations. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles, ranging from structural and natural challenges to legal impediments.
55	14888	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame. So that was an obstacle because if the workers were up there working with that, it would have to have been a very difficult situation and challenging to work on the building with such a massive force attached. Another obstacle would be the wind pressure they had to contend with; when the thousand-foot dirigible was only hung on by a single cable, that must have been a difficult obstacle with the wind blowing hard and causing the ship to sway dangerously. Furthermore, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework, which must have been a challenging obstacle because they had to do a lot of work that would take a considerable while to get done if it involved over sixty thousand dollars' worth of work on the frame. These financial and physical challenges underscore the immense difficulties of the project.
56	14889	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the readers learn that there are significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the readers learn that the architects are worried about the immense load of the blimp and the considerable wind pressure that is transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The architects would have to substantially strengthen and modify the Empire State Building for it to be accustomed to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which use hydrogen rather than helium, as said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacles was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting, so even if the dirigible is tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around uncontrollably. Later on, the architects' ambitious idea for a functioning mooring mast disappeared and it was then used primarily for observation, marking the end of this particular venture."
57	14890	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some considerable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve. One obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being held by a cable tether only, which would cause significant stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem they needed to make structural modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem, as there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature itself, and this problem was hard to solve and also hard to control. All these obstacles they faced lead them to give up for now and wait to see if later with more advanced technology they could finally make this dream come true, leaving the mast as a monument to an unrealized ambition.
58	14891	6	3	"When they built the Empire State Building they faced numerous obstacles. An obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architects wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the very top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles, or blimps. This was dangerous. It was because the mast could snap at such a high altitude and plummet to the ground or snap, and then dangle high above the street. ""... The Government people in Washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith, the four-year term governor of New York. Although it may have looked impressive, its not the safest idea, and the risks ultimately proved too great for the plan to be practical."
59	14892	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, the builders couldn't simply place a mast on top of the Empire State Building, because the building would surely collapse under the strain. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the necessary structural modifications. Another obstacle the builder's failed to see was the actual construction of a modern-day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been horrible over a densely populated area of New York. Lastly, the greatest obstacle of the building was nature itself. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"". This would be very dangerous. The dirigible could crash over pedestrians on the streets below, meaning it was not safe at all. These are the primary obstacles that prevented the Empire State Building from allowing dirigibles to dock there successfully."
60	14893	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders faced obstacles such as how the dirigibles would stay tied to the mast. They weren't sure as to how they would keep the dirigible from swiveling dangerously from strong air currents. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's framework."" This structural concern was a major issue. Another critical problem faced was the use of hydrogen in many dirigibles, which made them highly flammable and posed a severe fire risk over the city. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved too difficult to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the plan for a functioning airship terminal."
61	14894	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. One of the problems that they faced was that many dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This factor caused the owners of the Building to worry about the safety of the many civilians that lived in downtown New York, fearing a catastrophic fire. Another factor that the builders faced was that the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This caused problems because in landing fields the blimps could be weighted down with lead weights but that could not be done at the Empire State Building; many dirigibles would not be able to reach the Building either due to the winds, making a safe approach nearly impossible. One last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly too low over the urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the concept impractical from a legal standpoint. All these factors combined caused the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and passengers to disappear entirely.
62	14895	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, there is an obstacle that the builders had to overcome. Building the top of the empire state building was difficult because the dock part of the tower wasn't stable and required a complete redesign. Also the frame of the building couldn't support the dirigible, as a ""dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame,"" potentially compromising its structural integrity. The designers therefore designed a new tower that was a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, creating a more stable and visually striking structure. The winches and controlling machinery would be housed in the base of the shaft itself to manage the docking process. They also added an observation deck so that more passengers were able to wait for the dirigible in a designated area. Another problem with it was there was a law that aircrafts couldn't get too close to urban places, which presented a further regulatory barrier. Over all it was a hard painstaking design for them and costed a lot of money, ultimately for a concept that was never realized."
63	14896	6	3	"Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with a significant investment of over two hundred thousand dollars of modifications to handle the potential load. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flammable hydrogen. When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York, which would be catastrophic. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it, at risk from a falling airship. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
64	14897	6	3	"In the author's excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although dirigibles were a modern form of transportation they were highly dangerous and posed significant risks. As it states in the text, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen in highly flammable."" This, along with the ""violent air currents"" as stated elsewhere, were two of the primary risks that the builders had to take into serious consideration. The builders needed to converse the idea of a safe way in which dirigibles could dock there insuring that no one gets hurt, a challenge that seemed increasingly difficult. Another obstacle the builders had to take into consideration was the law passed which was ""against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" as explained in the text, creating a legal blockade. The excerpt clearly explains the numerous complications the builders had to endure and take into thought when constructing the Empire State Building for this purpose. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building underwent many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these challenges ultimately proved insurmountable."
65	14898	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle the builders had to overcome was the winds were constantly changing because of the violent air currents, which made stable docking procedures impossible. Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock on the empire state building was because many dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen which is very flammable, creating a severe fire hazard. So if one blew up like it did in Lakehurst, New Jersey, many more people would be effected by it in the dense urban environment. Yet another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there is because they couldn't use lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp because that would be dangerous for the people below if they were to fall. Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed is because of the sharp spires of the other buildings in the area, which posed a collision risk. If a Navy captain was afraid of having his blimp popped then no one should be allowed, highlighting the inherent dangers. The last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships can't fly too low over urban Areas, which legally forbade the practice. Those were the obstacles the builders could never overcome."
66	14899	6	3	There are many obstacles that the builders faced when creating the Empire State Building. First off, the height of the building came into question as there were many discussions about the design of the top of the building. The Empire State Building's first goal was to be the future of the city; they wanted to load people onto a blimp from the mast. Another problem is that there really is no way to get the blimp steady enough to stick to the building, and the large aircraft are not supposed to fly too close to the building because other buildings are around, creating a hazardous urban canyon. In conclusion, they did face many problems which ultimately prevented the original airship plan from succeeding.
67	14900	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the greatest being safety. As stated, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk. Also another issue was purposed, this was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered down, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mass, making a secure connection impossible. Yet another obstacle as to the reason why dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prevented the maneuver. These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to serve its original purpose as an airship terminal.
68	14901	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. There were high, violent air currents causing the building to constantly shift and creating unpredictable wind patterns at its summit. These powerful gusts made stabilizing an airship virtually impossible. It was neither practical nor safe for a large, buoyant vessel to attempt docking under such turbulent and uncontrollable conditions.
69	14902	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason is the dirigibles were unsafe. This is because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that was impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights are dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships to tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the wind could have pushed the ship onto sharp spires, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots wouldn't be able to get the mooring equipment close. These are the obstacles the builders faced, which caused the mooring equipment not to be installed and the ambitious plan to be abandoned.
70	14903	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety reasons, weather conditions, and government laws defeated the purpose of the mooring mast on top of the building. For example, many of the dirigibles used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium; ""hydrogen is highly flammable... above a densely populated area."" The builders realized this was not a safe proposition. Furthermore, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This created a dangerous situation because the ship would swing around the mast, risking a catastrophic impact. Lastly, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting a ship from even approaching the building closely, citing ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The whole idea that was built up to something great had slowly dwindled into impossibility. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many more, in their ultimately unsuccessful attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
71	14904	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, many obstacles of building the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles are described. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building, forgot some very important things to take into account. First, the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This structural reinforcement was a significant and costly undertaking. The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2). If an accident like the German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse in such a densely populated urban area. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The obstacles of making the Empire State Building into a mooring mast caused too many problems that ultimately could not be solved."
72	14905	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before, presenting unique engineering challenges. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework before they could even begin building the mast, which was a substantial financial and structural commitment. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mast could begin to be framed. This sequential construction process created significant logistical hurdles and delays. These initial physical and financial challenges were just the beginning of the problems they would encounter with the ambitious mooring mast plan.
73	14906	6	3	"Builders had many problems with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First of all in @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author explains that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would only add stress to the buildings frame"". Builders with that would have to construct the building to make it more stable, requiring extensive and expensive modifications. Also there were cases that outside the United States they use Hydrogen other than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and because New York is so populated it would not be safe to pedestrians and the city at large. Seeing this you can tell that builders had too many problems coming from such an ""easy"" thing, making the entire concept impractical and dangerous."
74	14907	6	3	"The obstacles on allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were far too great, something that should have been obvious before construction started. One major reason was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is very flammable, and after the ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst, the idea was shot down due to public fear and the immense risk involved. Another reason why it just didn't work was the wind current at the top of the Empire State Building. Winds would have been too great for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State, making the operation nearly impossible. There was already a law about Airships flying too low over urban areas. With a dirigible approaching the building would make it illegal, creating a regulatory barrier. Thus, these combined factors ended the idea to proceed with the mooring mast."
75	14908	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the excerpt tells the reader of a huge issue. It states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame."" Due to this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to handle the immense strain. Another setback is in paragraph @NUM2. It states, ""The greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" Due to violent air current, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making a stable connection unfeasible. Tethering the mooring mast would do little help. Lead weights could not be used. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""dangling weights high above pedestrians..., was neither practical nor safe."" All of these obstacles showed architects that the project at that time was impossible to execute safely and effectively."
76	14909	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their plan to dock dirigibles at the structure's mooring mast. As noted in the excerpt, ""the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to fail."" A significant and somewhat unseen obstacle was the fact that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium,"" which is a much more unstable gas. The danger was that if such a dirigible caught fire and went down over New York, many civilians would be killed or wounded. Another major obstacle the builders faced was the weather, specifically that ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This made it extremely difficult to anchor a dirigible securely to the mast. Furthermore, as the excerpt pointed out, they could not use lead weights hanging from the underside of the dirigible for stabilization because those weights would be hanging directly over the citizens below. These combined problems ultimately proved insurmountable for the builders of the Empire State Building."
77	14910	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their ambitious plan, and these obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the fundamental steel frame of the building itself had to be modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation"" of anchoring massive airships. Another critical obstacle was public safety; having a serious accident would be detrimental to many peoples' lives, especially because the building is located in such a densely populated area of Manhattan. Also, the powerful and unpredictable winds at such a great height made the entire docking procedure very dangerous for both the airship and the building. Lastly, there was an existing law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which directly conflicted with the docking operation. These challenges collectively ensured the mooring mast's concept was impractical from the start."
78	14911	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were numerous and complex. One obstacle that the builders confronted was managing the airship's speed during the delicate approach to the mast. Another significant obstacle that the builders faced was the design and safety of the landing area itself, which was exposed and precarious. The last key obstacle that the builders had to consider was making sure that the passengers could get on and off the airship safely once it was docked. As it says on paragraph six, ""passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank..."", but achieving this in practice, high above the city with shifting winds, presented a formidable challenge that contributed to the mast's lack of use."
79	14912	6	3	"There were plenty of problems engineers at the Empire State Building faced when they wanted to dock dirigibles at its famed mooring mast. Well for starters, the winds up that high were over-powering, as it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making a stable connection nearly impossible. Also there was the dirigibles themselves that caused a problem, for they were often filled with hydrogen, which is very flammable and posed a grave fire risk over the city. One other critical problem was existing air laws; they state that dirigibles, in urban areas, were not to fly too low, which directly contradicted the docking procedure. It is because of these combined and unresolved problems that ultimately destroyed Al Smith's idea that the building could functionally dock airships."
80	14913	6	3	"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made the builders' entire procedure illegal from the outset. Also, not only was it a danger for the citizens of New York City below, but due to the extreme weather conditions it was profoundly dangerous for the passengers and workers on the dirigible itself. L¸sted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This goes to show that any project, no matter how visionary, should be thoroughly checked for safety precautions at all times and under all conditions."
81	14914	6	3	Al Smith's dream of having airships dock atop the Empire State Building was cut short by bitter reality. The idea failed partially due to the impracticality of docking a massive, multi-hundred foot balloon filled with flammable hydrogen gas to a city building. The mere size of this airship was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly, the wind atop a skyscraper is great and inconsistent, creating powerful and unpredictable gusts. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building as seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in 1931; the balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which, due to its chemical nature, is extremely flammable. Blimps had exploded in the past, such as the tragic Hindenburg disaster. Engineers knew that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire State Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and the building itself. These impracticalities combined with the rising use of airplanes rather than blimps guaranteed no blimps would ever be successfully docked to the Empire State Building.
82	14915	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt on the ground below. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable and hard to control during the delicate landing process. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast, creating a hazardous entanglement. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any airship to even approach the mast, rendering the entire concept a legal impossibility from the start.
83	14916	6	3	Al Smith and his team of builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first problem with docking dirigibles is that the steel frame and foundation could not support the immense stress put on it by a dirigible attached to it, especially during high winds. Also, when the builders looked back on past dirigible accidents like the Hindenburg, they realized that if an accident were to occur, many lives would be at stake both on the airship and on the city streets. Furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be too low. Finally, and according to the builders, most importantly, the largest problem with docking dirigibles to the Empire State Building was mother nature. Winds at the top of the building were very high and changed unpredictably, effectively turning a dirigible docked at the mast into a disaster waiting to happen.
84	14917	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. This included not being able to put a mooring mast at the top of the building in fear that because the dirigible was being held by a ""single cable"" it ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" With the amount the dirigible weighed and the force of the wind, the building's frame would not be strong enough and would have to be ""modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle in attempting to get the dirigibles to dock was the wind. The building was high up where the wind currents were volatile and ""constantly shifting""; in result the back of the dirigibles ""would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A further obstacle faced by the builders was that they were trying to build the mooring mast in an urban area with other buildings close by; the dirigible could be pierced by a nearby structure and would also be dangerous for the pedestrians in the city below."
85	14918	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple problems for their idea for what the building would be used for. The first problem for the builders came up about the building's frame. A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building held by only one cable would cause too much stress to the building's frame. The load of the dirigible and the force of the wind would have to be transferred to the building's foundation, which was much too far below. The building would have to be modified, costing over sixty thousand dollars in structural modifications. The architects made changes to the building to fit these needs. But again the architects were presented with a problem. The mast of the building would cause problems that should have been spotted by the architects way before construction. The biggest problem had to do with safety issues. Most dirigibles outside the country used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. There already had been an explosion; one over New York could be catastrophic for the densely populated city.
86	14919	6	3	In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof of the Empire State Building, the workers would have to go through a series of complex tasks such as, significantly strengthening the steel frame, and designing an incredibly sturdy mast. If the frame were not strong enough to bear the immense load and dynamic forces, then the building would simply collapse under the strain. More than sixty thousand dollars was spent on restructuring and reinforcing the frame to handle the additional stress. Also with the high-speed winds present at such an altitude, the mast would have to be incredibly sturdy and well-anchored, otherwise the dirigible would not stay in one place and would be at risk of breaking free. After the tragic Hindenburg disaster, people widely realized how unsafe these hydrogen-filled dirigibles really were, and so the idea was found not only fundamentally unsafe but it also became illegal under new regulations. In conclusion, not a single blimp would ever be successfully docked at the mast, nor will one ever be.
87	14920	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand-foot dirigible would attach to the building by only a single cable, adding tremendous stress and strain to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the entire foundation and steel superstructure to address the critical issue of stability. Similarly, builders had to deal with the persistent issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifting and gusting at heights of over a thousand feet in the air. The considerable load of the massive dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit dangerous pressure and stress onto the building's foundation. This was a high safety concern for both the structure and the people below, and proved pivotal to the ultimate decision that dirigibles could not safely dock at the Empire State Building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the existing law against airships flying too low over densely populated urban areas, making it explicitly illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders thus faced significant and insurmountable obstacles such as inherent building weakness, public safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible.
88	14921	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith wanted to add a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building that would function as a docking station for dirigibles, but the dream was not meant to be. The first of many problems was getting the mooring mast, or docking station, securely installed on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A dirigible would only be held by one cable, which posed a major engineering challenge. The dirigible's enormous load and the powerful wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building's structure. There were also significant safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen for lift, and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a fire hazard. It is also very windy around the upper floors of the Empire State Building. To stabilize themselves, the dirigibles would have to hang heavy sandbags by ropes. These would hang precariously above the people and traffic below, creating a public danger. The mooring mast was a good idea in theory, but the builders faced too many practical and safety problems. Consequently, the project was never completed or used as intended."
89	14922	6	3	"Though in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed attainable, in reality there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial and costly problem was faced during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building's structure. As stated in the article: ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This extensive modification, necessary to overcome the obstacle of securely attaching the mooring mast, consumed over sixty thousand dollars and much time and effort from the construction team. A second obstacle which interfered immensely with operational safety was ""nature itself."" The violent and unpredictable winds at the top of the towering building would cause tethered dirigibles to ""swivel around and around"" the mooring mast uncontrollably. Dirigibles moored in open airfields could be weighted down by lead weights, but this idea could not be safely executed because ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Such fundamental and dangerous problems as these created many insurmountable obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building, dooming the ambitious plan."
90	14923	6	3	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those primary problems included the severe weather, the extreme height, and the dangerous gases used to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough natural force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that great height was far more extreme and gusty, and could easily cause the large, buoyant dirigible to swerve and smash into the structure. The next contributing factor was the sheer height itself. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a strict altitude limit for overflight. If the dirigibles were to fly too low over urban areas, it would be inherently unsafe for the city below. At any moment, a mechanical failure or a sudden gust of wind could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians with catastrophic results. The last major obstacle is the type of gas used for lift. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to the safer helium, which was also scarce at the time. A spark could ignite the hydrogen, which could also cause immense harm to the passengers and crew aboard. In conclusion, the powerful weather, the restrictive height limitations, and the volatile type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.
91	14924	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building believed that dirigibles were able to dock on the building if there was a mooring mast. However there were many obstacles to over-come to allow this to happen. Primarily, if a dirigible landed on the mast, it would force a lot of pressure on the building as it swayed in the wind. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored... would add stress to the buildings frame."" And as nature played a role, the powerful and constantly shifting wind could swing the massive body of the dirigible, possibly causing the frame of the building to break and the building to collapse. Another significant obstacle that the architects faced was the inherent danger of the airships. American dirigibles used helium, while dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This danger was tragically illustrated when ""... the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey..."" The architects realized that the Hindenburg explosion would have been worst if it occurred on the Empire State building ""... above a densely populated area..."", leading to catastrophic loss of life. These combined structural and safety challenges ultimately proved insurmountable for the ambitious docking plan."
92	14925	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were a lot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles at the top. One problem or obstacle was the safety of the dirigible itself, as ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another obstacle was nature itself, specifically the unpredictable and harsh weather conditions, as ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made any attempted docking maneuver extremely hazardous. The last problem was the existing law against airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" These are three key reasons why in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted that there were a lot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles, rendering the concept impractical from the outset."
93	14926	6	3	"Through the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the summit of the building. Some of the obstacles that the builders faced in this engineering challenge are significant. First, the builders faced the challenge of how the Empire State Building was going to be able to support the weight of these long aircrafts. We learned this when the author states ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" To overcome this problem ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" It is later said that these structural modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another critical problem that the builders faced was, how safe docking a blimp would be in a highly populated area. We learned that most dirigibles are made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" All in all, in the excerpt The Mooring Mast we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the peak of the building, which ultimately prevented the plan's realization."
94	14927	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building could not dock dirigibles because of the building's structure, the winds pushing the dirigibles, and public safety. The structure could not handle the swaying dirigible because of the powerful winds pushing the back side, creating immense stress on the building's frame. Furthermore, the volatile nature of the airships' fuel posed a grave risk, as ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows how dangerous it would be to put a large flammable dirigible over New York and the people in New York, threatening a disaster in the densely populated city. These fundamental issues of structural integrity and public safety were the primary reasons the docking plan was abandoned."
95	14928	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted explained why there is a landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The first obstacle the workers faced was there was no landing space on the top of the Empire State Building. This means dirigibles could not dock at all. To fix the problem of not having a landing area is, they would add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with winches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building. The workers used a significant amount of money to make the building so it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles was held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so violent and unpredictable that the dirigible couldn't maneuver to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out they gave up on the entire endeavor. Marcia Amidon Lusted explained what the workers tried to do to get a dirigible to land on the Empire State Building in the excerpt The Mooring Mast, highlighting the series of practical challenges that led to the failure of the ambitious project.
96	14929	6	3	Most of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were due to weather. If New York ever had a windy day, the dirigible would pull violently at the mast. The mast is attached to the framework of the building, and this constant strain might affect the steel frames or the structural integrity of the building. Another significant reason is the profound danger it would bring to all of New York. If a dirigible ever hit something or something went wrong, the dirigible would crash and burn on top of New York. With all the traffic and dense population of New York, you would most likely not want a burning dirigible falling overhead, making the entire concept far too risky to implement.
97	14930	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof, as the immense force exerted by a moored airship would add significant stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its safety. Another critical problem was that hydrogen is very flammable. If a dirigible had been caught on fire and exploded over downtown New York, then devastating law suites would undoubtedly be made against the building's owners. Furthermore, the builders faced the challenge of the winds at the top of the building. There were shifting winds due to violent air currents and these powerful, unpredictable winds would make it extremely difficult for pilots to dock the large, cumbersome dirigibles safely. The final obstacle was the legal restriction, a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas, which presented a regulatory barrier. These combined issues proved that the idea was fraught with difficulty.
98	14931	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem concerned the height and altitude of the Zeppelin. Even if they successfully docked the nose, the immense back end of the airship would be moving around everywhere from the powerful wind gusts, making a secure connection nearly impossible. Another compelling reason emerged from a specific tragedy; on May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was burned to the ground after takeoff, which means that it was very flammable from using hydrogen instead of helium. This disaster highlighted the extreme risks involved. All of these factors raised serious safty issues that needed to be sought out before such a plan could ever be considered viable, ultimately leading to its abandonment.
99	14932	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were enormously long; some were as long as one thousand feet. These airships were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back, but this method was insufficient for a structure of that scale. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be far too heavy for the building's frame, creating a dangerous amount of stress. In order for it to work, the entire structure would have to be significantly strengthened to accommodate the massive one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a costly process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework reinforcement. Another major obstacle was public safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States contained hydrogen, meaning the gas was highly flammable. If a catastrophic accident would occur like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was so densely populated. These and other obstacles proved that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles at the skyscraper.
100	14933	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One was that they had to find a method that would not make the building too unstable. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add tremendous stress to the building's frame,"" requiring costly reinforcements. Another obstacle was that the winds would be too strong and not safe for the dirigible to be up there, as ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making docking maneuvers perilous. A third example would be that it was too dangerous to have the dirigible up there because the gases within were extremely flammable; ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen... and Hydrogen is highly flammable,"" creating a severe fire hazard over the city. The final obstacle the builders would have to face was that there is a law that does not allow airships to come too close to the ground in urban areas, creating a legal impediment. So in conclusion we can see that even though it was a good idea to port dirigibles, it was not a practical one due to these insurmountable challenges."
101	14934	6	3	"In this excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was redesigning the building's original skeleton to fit the needs of the mooring mast. This can be shown when the excerpt states, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers had to change their first design to meet the mandatory structural requirements for the mooring mast, a costly and complex process. The workers also had to face the fact that overall, the mooring mast was too dangerous to use. This can be proven when the excerpt says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The dirigibles used outside of the United States used a gas they created a dangerous risk for accidents, posing a significant fire hazard over the city. Another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM3). The winds caused the dirigible to move too much that it became unsafe to use, making stable docking nearly impossible. Ultimately, the builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with many insurmountable obstacles while they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there."
102	14935	6	3	"There were many different obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles. For example ""the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Because of the weather itself it caused them not to be able to build the mooring mast effectively, as the unpredictable gusts created a hazardous environment. Another reason is ""using the empire state Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". It could easily kill people that were roaming around if any part of the operation were to fail. Lastly they could not moor at the empire State Building because ""It was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the entire venture from the outset. These combined issues of nature, public safety, and regulation presented a series of formidable challenges."
103	14936	6	3	During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was Nature. The winds at this height are shifting to frequently causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board or disembark passengers. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below, creating a serious public danger. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building without violating aviation regulations. These significant obstacles collectively forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction indefinitely.
104	14937	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were some of the following. They needed an exact way of getting everything perfect for the job, requiring immense precision. The whole building process for this job was very complicating and needed the best expertese, involving complex engineering challenges. In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith's quote greatly backs up to my point. He says ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast"". It tells just how much people are working on this job, highlighting the collaborative yet difficult effort. In conclusion, this was a complicated job. They weren't positive if the mast even be able to stay secure. They also werent positive if the fluids inside would be but a problem factor, leaving many technical uncertainties unresolved."
105	14938	6	3	"In the piece ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it describes what the mast on the Empire State Building was really for. There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One problem they faced was that the dirigible landed on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building. This means the building would have to be modified and strengthened considerably to handle these new forces. Safety was also a big issue for the mast. Because the dirigibles used hydrogen, it could catch on fire and be destroyed over a densely populated area, risking countless lives. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. This made the back of the ship swivel around uncontrollably. Lastley, it was not successful is because of the law against airships flying too low, a legal barrier that could not be overcome. Before the constructors built all this extra to the building they should have thought of all the defects it could have, as the obstacles ultimately proved too great."
106	14939	6	3	Al Smith was a very competitive person, and this trait was clearly demonstrated during the construction of his skyscraper. One of the primary challenges Al had to go through was competing with another building, specifically the Chrysler Building. He was determined to make his building taller than the Chrysler Building, which was also under construction at the time. In the year 1930, if he didn't make his building taller, he would have lost the coveted title of the tallest building in New York. This intense rivalry drove the final design and the famous last-minute addition of a spire, ensuring his project claimed the record.
107	14940	6	3	Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State Building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One significant reason why dirigibles could not moor to the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law effectively left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers and planners failed to notice this crucial regulation. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was the immense pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the structure. This caused another considerable sum of money to be spent trying to fix this structural problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The powerful winds that high off the ground made maneuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult and dangerous. This was proven when, in December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible 'Los Angeles' approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds, ultimately demonstrating the impracticality of the entire concept.
108	14941	6	3	There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality, there are many flaws with them. One of these ideas is using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon Lusted. In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles. During the process of building the Empire State Building, many of the blueprints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the dirigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the people in the city below. If the highly flammable helium inside the dirigibles were to ignite, then it would be putting thousands of people's lives in jeopardy. Finally, the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds at such a high altitude. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also created a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall, there are many compelling reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality.
109	14942	6	3	The idea of docking dirigibles on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one. It seems as though the dream of dirigible transportation was on its way up; however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al Smith's competitive nature not only pushed the building to an unprecedented 1,250 ft., but also aimed to combine transportation in new, fashionable, and effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles was that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building; though the necessary precautions were made, this obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skeptical. What if it were to blow up over a crowded New York City street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigible plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed, by the late 1930's the idea of dirigibles atop the Empire State Building had completely disappeared.
110	14943	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders failed to realize that constructing the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had problems on its own anyways. According to the excerpt, one of its greatest obstacles was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This resulted in a significant problem because the dirigible could be blown anywhere, not landing in the mast properly and causing damage to itself or the building. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets below. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights because it used open landing fields, but this was not a good idea to be using at the Empire State Building due to the confined space. Another thing builders should have considered was that there was a law in place already that is against airships flying too low over urban areas. All in all, there were a lot of significant things that the builders should have considered before attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
111	14944	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. There needed to be modifications made to the structure to make it safe for a dirigible to land there. The biggest obstacle was nature. Lusted said it best in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This unpredictable movement made a safe and stable docking procedure nearly impossible. The final problem the builders faced was, even if they did manage to figure out a way to put the mooring mast up, there was still a law stating dirigibles illegal to land there. Lusted said in paragraph @NUM2, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". This legal barrier presented an insurmountable final challenge. Obviously, from the examples given, the builders of the Empire State building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
112	14945	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were weather. Nature itself would ruin the time frame of building and posed a constant danger to any potential landing. Winds would shift violently at such a high altitude, and even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, creating a highly unstable and hazardous situation. Another challenge the builders ran into was that a primary reason dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This regulation effectively prohibited the very operation they were planning for, rendering the entire concept impractical from a legal standpoint.
113	14946	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring at the top of the building. The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and shifting direction. This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock to swing around wildly and dip below in the wind, which poses many safety risks for passengers going on and off the zeppelin. The dirigible could also puncture its fragile frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safety risks for people on the building and on the ground. To have a zeppelin attached to the building also made it structurally unstable and significant modifications had to be made to the frame of the building to give it more support against the immense pull. In the end, the idea was dropped because it would never work safely and was ultimately unrealistic.
114	14947	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles while trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle was nature. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This would make a ship swivel around dangerously; even if it was tied, the back would move uncontrollably. As noted, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of ship with swivel."" Another obstacle was safety. Foreign ships used hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas. In open fields, they could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these weights high above a city street posed a grave risk. If an accident happened with either the gas or the weights, it would be extremely fatal. A flaming dirigible or a falling metal object at extreme heights would cause serious injuries because the landing is above a highly populated city. It was noted that ""Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen... is highly flammable,"" and the weights ""could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be hanging high above pedestrians on the street."" Furthermore, a law forbids ships to fly in low urban areas, so even if the mooring mast worked, it couldn't be used legally. These combined events led to the quiet disappearance of the thought in the late 1930's."
115	14948	6	3	"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Al Smith had the ambitious idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation, docking passengers directly atop the skyscraper. The idea sounded great in theory, with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy five miles per hour and moving thousands of feet without needing to be refueled. Anxious, Al Smith was very unsure of when the project would all be done, saying, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" However, it would just not be possible for the architect to simply drop the huge mooring mass on top of the buildings flat roof; substantial structural reinforcements were necessary. Another significant problem would be the violent wind currents at that altitude, which made stable docking a dangerous fantasy. Ultimately, the fate of the dirigible as a common transport had faded out, especially as airplanes became more suitable and reliable for passengers then the problematic dirigibles."
116	14949	6	3	Based on the excerpt I just read, these are some of the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1 faced. One of the obstacles was the balloon because it had helium and it was also flammable. The second obstacle is that you cannot control the balloon and the third obstacle The Empire State Building had was a flat roof. These were the primary challenges that the @ORGANIZATION1 had to consider for the docking plan to be viable and safe for the public and the structure itself.
117	14950	6	3	There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the stress there would be on the building's structural frame when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above their heads, it poses a significant threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights could not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed to fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose, a testament to an ambitious but impractical vision.
118	14951	6	3	"Dirigibles, also known today as blimps, used to dock at the Empire State Building. The Empire State building was used as a docking ground for dirigibles, which are enormous steel-formed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, which made them lighter than air. They had a top speed of @NUM1 mph for thousands of miles. ""Al Smith saw an opportunity for the empire state building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off,"" as stated in the excerpt. The dirigibles were docked by an electric winch which stopped the big balloon from going anywhere and tied it securely to the mast. Al Smith was successful when building the mooring mast, but its practical use for dirigibles was ultimately very limited."
119	14952	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that it wouldn't be able to use a cable tether effectively, because it adds significant stress to the building's frame. This structural stress was a major engineering concern for the designers. Also in the story they tell you how the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation and the powerful forces exerted by a docked airship. These fundamental structural challenges presented serious difficulties for the ambitious docking plan from the very beginning.
120	14953	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good, many things could have gone wrong. The Empire State building was an enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on, winds would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to maneuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used hydrogen in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were hailed as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building looked good they still had to be careful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city, ultimately making the venture too hazardous to pursue."
121	14954	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to loose controll and crash, making a safe and stable connection to the mast nearly impossible. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the hinden burg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flamible gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated @CAPS1.Y.C. the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below. These significant challenges ultimately prevented the ambitious docking plan from becoming a practical reality."
122	14955	6	3	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attemting to allow dirigibles to dock there are safty and nature. Safty was an obstacle because most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium and because hydrogen is flammible it was not safe at all because it could have caught fire just like the ""Hindenburg caught fire in 1937 so the owners of the Empire state building saw how it was unsafe for the public and the building, creating an unacceptable risk. Nature is another obstacle because the wind currents on the top of the building kept shifting because of violent air currents, which would have made it extremely difficult for a pilot to maintain control during a delicate docking maneuver. Those are some examples of some obstacles the builders of the Empire state building had, which together ensured the mooring mast would never be used for its intended purpose."
123	14956	6	3	"Although high expectations were concieved for the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The dream of having a mooring mast to dock new airships was quickly halted when architects first discovered the stress that a dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add to the building's fame. As a result, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would...be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph @NUM1). Consequently, architects had to reinforce the buildings framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an obstacle as well. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building. Finally, architects had also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be violent, forceful and unpredictable. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). Moreover, the violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" feared that ""the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (paragraph @NUM3). In effect, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building quietly disappeared as these combined issues proved insurmountable. As described by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."
124	14957	6	3	The Top of the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid but there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask the necessary functional equipment. It was designed with a specific and ambitious purpose in mind, intended to serve as a mooring mast for the great airships of the era. This vision meant the structure was conceived as an active terminal in the sky, a gateway for a new form of transportation. Ultimately, however, this grand function was never realized, and the mast settled into its role as a defining architectural feature and a base for broadcasting antennas, its original purpose fading into history.
125	14958	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a constant danger of a catastrophic fire. Another reason was the wind. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which created a highly unstable and treacherous environment for navigating such a large and fragile aircraft. It will not be safe for the pedestrians below the Empire State Building if a dirigible, struggling against the powerful gusts, were to break free from its tether or collide with the structure itself. These fundamental issues of safety and control proved too great to overcome, rendering the ambitious docking plan unfeasible."
126	14959	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the narrative centers on the Empire State Building, which was constructed to be the tallest building. There were copious ways in which the builders faced challenges attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable)"". This detail proves how it was likely to destroy the whole entire Empire State Building with fire, creating a significant safety hazard. Another point that portrays how builders faced challenges attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is when it states, ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was practical nor safe"". This statement highlights the safety of the people walking on the street below and what if they were to get hurt from such an operation. Finally, another detail that portrays the obstacles the builders faced is when it states, ""... blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings"". This point proves that if a dirigible were to blow against the building, it was not the only structure in danger, but others around it too, compounding the risk involved in the entire endeavor."
127	14960	6	3	"In the nonfiction article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it gives information on the potential problems arising from the mast. In one section it says, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not structurally strong enough to hold such a significant weight, requiring substantial changes. Another problem was the force of nature. The workers had to take nature into effect, considering that if they had a dirigible or a blimp up there, the wind could potentially harm the airship and disrupt the docking process. There was also a law in place that forbade aircraft from flying that low over the city, creating a legal barrier. Finally, workers had to ensure the building's height exceeded any other structure that was taller. In another part, it says, ""On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying, ""Their top they said would serve a higher calling."" The builders had a lot to take into effect; they had height issues, frame issues, and law issues that they had to carefully sort out before proceeding."
128	14961	6	3	"In the novel, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the Empire State Building faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant engineering challenges. A primary problem with the docking plan was that the building was already complete before the idea came to mind, making retrofitting difficult. A second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed and reinforced in order for dirigibles to be able to dock safely. Then there was the question of how the airships, or dirigibles, would stay stationary next to the building in high winds. These were harder problems to solve after it was made clear that it was illegal to have dirigibles fly so close to buildings as well. Plus, there was the fact that if they were to crash, they are highly flammable and could kill people on the ground or in the building. Those are some of the key facts that made it profoundly difficult for the Empire State Building to build a dirigible dock as described in the novel."
129	14962	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there are several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This ambitious idea would not work easily because the dirigible itself was way too heavy, and that would cause more pressure towards the Empire State Building's structure. When there is a massive amount of pressure on the building, it risked a potential collapse. As stated, ""The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which is nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another significant obstacle was the immense cost involved in the project. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" representing a major financial investment. Furthermore, in New York there are many places and people are tightly packed together. There simply wasn't any open space that was big enough for the dock required for such large aircraft. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York city."" These are the main obstacles that prevented the Empire State Building from successfully allowing dirigibles to dock."
130	14963	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One obstacle they faced was that the building's steel frame would have to be significantly modified and reinforced. This was necessary because the dirigible would add considerable stress to the frame of the building when docked on it. These structural modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a substantial sum. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still in the unpredictable weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it dangerous for passengers attempting to disembark as well as for pedestrians on the street below and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up securely. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was considered very dangerous for the public. Although it seemed like a good and innovative idea at the time, there were ultimately too many obstacles and dangers involved in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building for it to be a practical reality."
131	14964	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most apparent problems was its location in a dense urban area with a lot of pedestrians walking the streets. They didn't want dirigibles flying so close overhead without knowing what was going to happen, posing a significant risk to public safety. Another major concern was that a German dirigible had been tragically destroyed by fire. They had to consider how much worse that could have been if such a disaster occurred on the mooring mast, possibly killing people on the ground and in the building and completely destroying the structure itself. There was also the issue of how much more construction and money it would take for the Empire State Building to properly hold and secure a massive dirigible. Ultimately, there were many complex problems they didn't fully think about in the initial planning process, which is why the mooring mast was never successful as originally planned.
132	14965	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant problem was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add immense stress to the building's structural frame. So in order to adequately strengthen the frame to bear this load, it was estimated it would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a substantial additional expense. Another considerable challenge was the combined stress of the dirigible's heavy load and the powerful, unpredictable wind pressure at that great height. The last and perhaps most critical obstacle was public safety, because if a major accident took place in the densely populated downtown New York area, the consequences would be absolutely devastating. These fundamental issues proved too great to overcome for the docking concept.
133	14966	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary obstacle that the builders faced was safety. In the text, it was noted that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"", and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a severe fire hazard. Furthermore, in another paragraph, it states that ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"", which is neither practical nor safe for disembarking passengers. If the ship is tied, the back should be stable and not swing freely. The last obstacle that the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area safely. Though some ships did attempt to reach the building, there was no success in establishing a functional docking operation."
134	14967	6	3	"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was first conceived, builders did not fully realize the significant obstacles that would have to be overcome. One formidable obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a highly unstable environment. This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be tossed around freely in the sky, making it extremely dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of these dangerous winds occurred in 1930, when the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. A major concern for public safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something were to go wrong, there could be catastrophic consequences for the heavily populated downtown area of New York City. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area safely."" Because of these combined and insurmountable obstacles, the ambitious idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never successfully accomplished."
135	14968	6	3	Now, people recognize what a ludicrous idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building; however, in the 1920s and 1930s people were oblivious to the many potential failures and the obstacles the builders would face. One critical obstacle was that most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and put the entire city at a great risk of a fiery disaster. Another immense obstacle was nature itself, as the powerful and shifting winds on top of the Empire State Building made it dangerously hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mast for a secure tie-up. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a specific law that prohibited airships from flying too low over densely populated urban areas like New York City. Overall, the futuristic idea could not be successfully projected into a real-life, practical interpretation because of the severe obstacles faced by the builders of the mast. Now people have airplanes and airports to dock planes, so there is no practical use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building regarding modern aviation.
136	14969	6	3	"Builders had to face significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have a massive airship dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians below. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether, and that precarious connection would add a lot of stress on the building's structural frame, creating a serious engineering challenge. Another big obstacle they faced was the unpredictable force of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making stable mooring nearly impossible. Over @MONEY1 would be needed for this ambitious and hazardous plan to happen, a cost that underscored the immense difficulties involved."
137	14970	6	3	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building caused many obstacles that were difficult to overcome. One of these primary obstacles was that dirigibles from outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen rather than the safer helium. Using hydrogen was highly flammable and posed an extreme fire risk. They knew how dangerous it was, a fear confirmed by historical accidents. In the excerpt it says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle people had to deal with was the power of nature. In the excerpt, it says that air currents were ""violent"" and it would be very hard to control the large, buoyant dirigible in such conditions. Finally, dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building would be outright illegal. It says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not legally dock over a heavy populated city like New York City. In the end, these many interconnected obstacles made it profoundly challenging to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
138	14971	6	3	"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building, builders faced an onslaught of problems that should have been easy to pick up on from the start. Everyone got caught up in the hype of the idea, in my opinion, overlooking the clear dangers. Outside of the U.S., other dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of the inert helium used domestically. After the Hindenburg disaster, the grave risk became undeniable, as ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Winds also played a critical role as an obstacle in the construction and operation. The turbulent conditions meant that ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles would not be able to securely tie to the dock and stay in place because of these violent air currents. Furthermore, there was a specific law preventing airships from flying too low in urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for an air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...,"" creating a legal barrier. Finally, times changed and planes became the new fad for air transport, effectively ending the dirigible's run as the main provider of passenger travel."
139	14972	6	3	"The builders ran into quite a few serious problems when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium; and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would mean that if a docked dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire, the resulting catastrophe would likely burn down the Empire State Building and much of the surrounding city, killing many people with its violent explosion. Another main obstacle, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, was nature itself: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These powerful and unpredictable winds would make it almost impossible for a pilot to navigate a dirigible to the mast and actually dock safely. In addition, the dirigible would be swinging around violently once it was tied to the mast, endangering the ship and the building. The third major problem was the existing law against aircraft flying low over urban areas, as stated in paragraph @NUM3: ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". With the law firmly in the way, no sensible operator would even want to try. Those are the three major problems found when building the mast, each one presenting a formidable challenge on its own."
140	14973	6	3	"The Empire State Building builders had to face hard obstacles in their plan for dirigibles, which involved.... ""accommodating passengers,"" establishing new routes, and confronting the greatest obstacle of all, which was nature itself. By accommodating the passengers, they had to find a way to bring them efficiently to the existing transatlantic routes. This was a particular challenge because the new, more direct routes for airships weren't made yet. The reasoning for this is because the building itself needed to be more taller to serve as a viable port. So then they added more structures, including the distinctive mooring mast, on the top of it. They wanted the State Building to overcome nature itself because the building @CAPS1 Shifting from ""violent air currents"" that made stable mooring a constant battle. Also, the dirigible was more suited to open fields for mooring, not a skyscraper in a dense urban canyon. The State building also was weight down by the lead weights used to secure an airship, adding to the structural concerns. These combined issues proved too difficult to resolve successfully."
141	14974	6	3	There were a few significant obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One primary challenge was the violently changing wind currents at the great height where the docking was to take place. This unpredictable and powerful wind would constantly shift the massive blimp, creating a serious risk of it being sent crashing into another building and puncturing the side of the gas-filled balloon. Furthermore, the process of dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of structural stress on the building itself. This repeated strain would disrupt the integrity of the steel frame and could potentially effect the stability of the building as a whole. Also, a major safety concern was that most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than the safer helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, a danger tragically illustrated in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these compelling reasons, the iconic mooring mast never saw a single docked blimp.
142	14975	6	3	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, engineers faced several obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph number nine, one fundamental problem was ""the stress of the dirigible's load."" With all this immense weight being transmitted directly to the building's foundation, the entire steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate its new function. This structural reinforcement was verry expensive to do, requiring sixty thousand dollars that were nesciary for the modifications. Another critical problem was that the blimps would not stay still while docked. The high-altitude winds would violently toss it around, making a secure mooring nearly impossible. A proposed solution involved putting heavy waights at the back of the landing fields, but these weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrans on the street"" as explainede in paragraph, creating an unacceptable public hazard."
143	14976	6	3	"When building the Empire State Building, the planners and builders were faced with several formidable obstacles in their attempts to have dirigibles dock there. The builders first had to ensure that the building itself was going to be structurally able to support the immense weight and force of a docked dirigible. After they theoretically completed this, other critical issues relating to public safety arose. It was very dangerous because some air ballons were made out of hydrogen which were highly flammable. If their were any issues, such as a spark or a collision, New York's dense population could be in grave danger from a resulting fire or explosion. The wind also was a persistent issue because it was so shifty and unpredictable; a dirigble would be heavy in the back and difficult to control. Dangling such a massive and unstable object above the streets of new york was very dangerous for the people below. The last complications that affected the idea of docking the drigbles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area."" Ultimately, because of the legal restriction, the inherent safety concerns, and the uncontrollable nature complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
144	14977	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the author details the many obstacles of the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building, creating an immediate legal barrier. Another significant obstacle was the severe lack of a sufficient landing area; it was a challenge to expand in the densely built environment of New York City, causing it to be extremely hard to land and maneuver the large dirigibles safely. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself, as the unpredictable weather and powerful winds would cause the dirigibles to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe,"" highlighting the impracticality of proposed solutions in an urban setting."
145	14978	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One initial difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast itself. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof..."" because it ""would add stress to the building's frame."" This was a major difficulty because the Empire State Building's existing frame had to be specially modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate it, resulting in a substantial cost of sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to the forces of nature. As many dirigibles used ""hydrogen instead of helium,"" there was a great risk of a catastrophic fire; always a terrifying problem above a populated New York City. The wind was also a persistent problem. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would have to be weighed down by heavy lead weights; again, a solution not feasible high above New York City. A final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. The builders' faced the issue of an existing law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" This made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" In summary, some of the many difficulties faced by builders of the Empire State Building were mast designs, the challenges posed by nature, and existing air flights laws."
146	14979	6	3	Some of the problems they faced while building the Empire State Building were related to its great height. The challenge of constructing a building that high was compounded by the expectation for it to perform functions such as boarding dirigibles. The force of the dirigible, particularly its impact against the building's mooring mast, could cause a structural failure. This potential for disaster, where the immense strain from a docked airship might compromise the building's integrity, is why the contractor had to reshape the skeleton of the building to better distribute and withstand these extraordinary loads.
147	14980	6	3	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were a lot of conflicts that the builders ran into while trying to let the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. One problem was safety. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles were often made of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and a fire would have been a catastrophic problem if it occurred above the people on the street and the building itself. Another problem was nature. The winds at the proposed docking altitude were way too strong and unpredictable. As the passage says, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making a stable and safe docking procedure nearly impossible. One last reason is because there was a law against aircraft from flying too close to neighborhoods. All in all, the plan for dirigibles encountered a lot of practical and legal obstacles."
148	14981	6	3	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York, had a brilliant idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the world. He would put a mooring mast on the top to tether dirigibles so passengers could disembark here. But this plan had many flaws. As one source noted, ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This is a problem because if the mast was just placed on the building, the immense force could cause the structure to destroy itself. Another problem is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen."" Hydrogen is a very flammable gas, and a potential ignition would put the whole section of the city underneath the Zeppelin at risk. The third reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas, making the entire concept legally unfeasible."
149	14982	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, many obstacles are described from the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City. Thousands of dollars were spent on hopeless modifications to the building, in efforts to add a mooring mast to the top for the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. These efforts, however, were unsuccessful. Two main obstacles builders faced during construction were safety and nature. After a 1937 dirigible fire in New Jersey, owners of the Empire State Building ""...realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" highlighting the severe fire risk. Furthermore, an existing law forbade low-flying airships in urban areas. Also, the unpredictable and powerful winds at that altitude provided workers with a very risky, dangerous situation for any attempted docking. In the end, although builders faced many obstacles during construction, dirigibles were never successfully docked on the building."
150	14983	6	3	The Empire State Building faced several major problems in making a station for dirigibles to dock. One is that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind from landing or docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city like New York. There were also many issues with the practicalities of the mast itself, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked and keeping them there securely against the strong winds, never mind the danger posed by the extremely flammable hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with. These combined legal and safety challenges ultimately made the ambitious plan unworkable.
151	14984	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were for many different reasons. One of them is the weather, ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which made stabilizing an airship nearly impossible. The second one is that they have a law against airships, ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which legally prevented the dirigibles from approaching the building. They also have the problem is that the dirigible will be dangling high above people's heads, ""...they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe,"" posing a constant threat to those below. This combination of natural, legal, and public safety issues are some of the problems that they had to confront, ultimately dooming the ambitious plan."
152	14985	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the obstacle of safety, to make sure everyone could board the dirigible safely without any form of danger. Another obstacle is arranging the dirigibles so that they are able to board passengers from there, a complex logistical challenge. @PERSON1 said ""the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gears,"" indicating technical difficulties in completing the mast's apparatus. People didn't want to try it, so that would be another obstacle, a lack of public confidence in the novel idea. If people didn't want to try it then it would become just a decoration, and that's not what Al Smith wanted, who had envisioned a functional transportation hub. The last obstacle would be that it wouldn't hold for long as said in the excerpt ""The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" In other words, the architects didn't think too far ahead into the future to see if the mooring mast would even be used, rendering their efforts ultimately futile. These are some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in their ill-fated endeavor."
153	14986	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians on the streets far below. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic and unworkable. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add too much stress, especially with added wind pressure, to the building's frame, threatening its structural integrity. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation, a complex and costly engineering solution. These fundamental challenges proved insurmountable for the project's success.
154	14987	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof for it would have interfered with the building's overall frame and structural design. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building to support the additional load. Another obstacle for the docking of dirigibles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives should an accident occur. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building from the unstable craft. Those were the significant obstacles that builders faced and which prevented the making of a functional mooring mast to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
155	14988	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the frame of the building. In @LOCATION1 @NUM1, it explains that attaching a dirigible to the building would add stress to the building's frame from the immense weight and force. They had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work, a substantial and expensive undertaking. One of the biggest obstacles was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen to power them, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There is a great risk of the dirigibles catching on fire when flying over such a densely populated area as New York, threatening a catastrophic disaster. Another obstacle in the way of the mooring mast was the conditions at the top of the building. At the top of the Empire State Building, there are violent winds that would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, making a secure connection impossible. Lastly, an obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As explained in @LOCATION1, because of this law, it is illegal to even fly up to the Empire State building, creating a legal barrier to the entire concept. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used and remained an architectural novelty.
156	14989	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some significant problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't just allow the dirigibles to land on the building's flat roof, because the immense weight of the massive airship would add dangerous stress to the building's structural frame. The ambitious plan never followed through for a few critical reasons. A big issue was public safety. The dirigibles often used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This highly flammable substance was considered far too dangerous to use above the densely populated streets of New York. However, the greatest and most insurmountable issue was the powerful wind. It was always changing direction and strength because of unpredictable air currents around the skyscraper. The dirigible could be tethered down to the mooring mast, but it would still be floating erratically in the air high above the pedestrians below. Ultimately, the plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there was a complete and utter failure.
157	14990	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had solved the problems of dirigibles having no where to land. However, having the building as a place for dirigibles to dock proved to be much harder than it initially seemed. First, the enormous balloon would cause too much structural stress to the building's frame. The author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Also, because this frame would need to be significantly modified, a lot of money would need to be spent on reinforcements. The author states, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). It was simply too financially risky to invest on such an unsure project. Also, they soon realized how catastrophically dangerous any potential accidents could be over such a densely populated urban area. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). If anything had happened, such as a fire or explosion, a very large part of New York could have suffered immense damage. Although the plan of creating a mast for dirigibles was impressive and visionary, it was neither logical financially, or logical for saftey reasons."
158	14991	6	3	During the Building of the Mast, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The primary obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast, lots of stress would be added to the buildings frame and therefore costly strengthening modifications had to take place before the mast was erected. Another significant problem was how to tether the Blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide open fields which allowed for wieghts to be place in the front and back of the blimp, so they could be secured properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached only to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp and therefore no safe way to tie the entire airship down. And finally the last problem builders faced was the challenge of how to even get the blimp docked. Since there was such high and gusty winds on top of the building, there was no feasible way to dock the blimp in less it was a day of perfect weather with no wind at all. Ultimately all those combined problems made it so the mast could never be used for its intended purpose.
159	14992	6	3	Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the existing law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas, creating a regulatory challenge from the start. Also, the builders would have to reinforce critical parts of the building to support the immense stress the massive dirigibles would place on the structural frame. This required substantial and expensive modifications to the steelwork. Lastly, nature itself would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent and shifting winds would move the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly and uncontrollably from the mast. These combined obstacles, from legal to structural to environmental, made sure that dirigibles could not ever be practically docked at the empire state building.
160	14993	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were considerable. Firstly, the dirigibles would add tremendous stress to the frame of the building, a risk that could not be ignored. The steel frame of the empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation, requiring significant engineering work. In fact, over Sixty thousand dollars were needed to moderate the framework of the building to handle the additional loads. However, The greatest Obstacle was nature itself because the winds on the top of the building were Constantly Shifting due to violent Air currents, creating an unpredictable and hazardous environment for docking a large, buoyant aircraft. This were the primary obstacles that prevented the builders of the empire state building from their attempt to allow dirigibles dock there.
161	14994	6	3	"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking. Firstly, the main problem was the location and the immense structural strain. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York, where a single spark could lead to catastrophe. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public, rendering the plan legally unfeasible from the start. Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed."
162	14995	6	3	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over two hundred feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame, requiring extensive and costly reinforcement. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used, rendering the significant investment largely pointless. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mask was not used as much as the builders thought."
163	14996	6	3	"The builders came across many obstacles while trying to build the Empire State building for dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was just having ""... a single cable tether."" which they went on to say it would add stress to the building so they had to fix that. They choose to modify the frame and strengthen it as well to handle the immense forces involved. Another obstacle was having to get the right equipment and technical knowledge. They had to go get some information from the Naval air station to understand the complexities of airship handling. The last obstacle would be the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen instead of Helium. This had meant it was very flammable which was something they must consider for public safety over the city. While trying to make this work for the dirigibles they came across building problems, safety, and dangerous problems that ultimately proved too difficult to overcome."
164	14997	6	3	When the Empire State building was built the workers were trying to find new ways to utilize the structure. They had suddenly had found some problems with one being the top of the empire state building. Workers had tried to figure out how they were going to put a Dirigibles on top of the building so that they could be able to pick up people and to drop them off up there but there were different problems. These issues included the high winds at that altitude and the structural integrity required to hold a massive airship steady. The ambitious plan to create a skyport for passenger travel was ultimately hindered by these significant and unforeseen challenges, leading to the concept's abandonment.
165	14998	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building's mast were confronted with many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, the builders had to compensate for the stress a docked airship would place on the building. According to the text, ""the stress... would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" As a result, the building's steel frame would need to be modified to accommodate the load, a complex and expensive engineering challenge. Another obstacle faced by the builders were the weather conditions at that height: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Any airship attempting to dock there would be violently buffeted around by the wind, making a safe and secure mooring practically impossible. Finally, there was the obstacle of safety. As the text states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" The fear of a Hindenburg-type accident over a densely populated area gave pause to the builders. In conclusion, the builders had to face several huge obstacles, which combined eventually doomed the project to failure."
166	14999	6	3	In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigible's load and wind pressure, a force that would need to be transmitted all the way down its structure. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles built outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City, a danger tragically highlighted by the destruction of a German airship. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable mooring nearly impossible. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below. Those are the significant obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in their ultimately unsuccessful attempt to dock dirigibles.
167	15000	6	3	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure, requiring extensive modifications to the foundational support. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An additional problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigible's back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant it would be illegal for a ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
168	15001	6	3	"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start. The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Modifications would have to be made to the entire building's structure to handle this immense force. Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible safely, as the massive airship would be swinging erratically. These obstacles baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the ambitious project was abandoned entirely."
169	15002	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were many and at the end the dock could not happen. One of the obstacles was that the building's foundation had to be modified to withstand the incredible forces involved. In the story it says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Being so high, the dock would be moved around violently because of the powerful winds at that altitude. Also, the blimp itself could not even be attached to the dock because the shifting winds wouldn't let it approach or hold a stable position long enough for a safe connection. In the end, the dirigible dock was not meant to happen, as it came with a lot of insurmountable problems for the builders and even the architects, leading to the concept's ultimate failure."
170	15003	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted there are many obstacles that the builders stumble across. Many people would have a hard time with creating the docks for the dirigibles for the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that the builders had was ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area,"" which the proposed mast attempted to solve. Another obstacle that they could come across is that the dirigibles could take too long to fuel up and could cause a jam with other dirigibles waiting to use the single mast, creating logistical chaos. Furthermore, the safety of maneuvering such large aircraft in a dense urban environment presented a constant risk. Even though they had these huge obstacles, they managed to construct the mast, but they never found a way to actually use the dirigibles there without any types of problems, and the plan was eventually scrapped."
171	15004	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obstacles they faced were there was a lack of suitable landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float easier. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph 4). This was because the immense size and weight of an airship required a specialized and robust structure. Another obstacle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to reinforce the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible, a significant additional cost. The third obstacle faced was there was a law against it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building was ambitious, the obstacles to face were too great for the builders with the lack of a suitable landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law against aircrafts flying too low."
172	15005	6	3	There were significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building, rendering the plan potentially useless from the start. The greater reason was the critical issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone below. This was a terrifying risk in a densely populated city. The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents around the skyscraper. Even if tethered down, the ship would swivel around the tower getting tangled in its own lines or with the mast itself. In conclusion, the idea had to be dropped, though some ships have tried to dock there without success, proving the inherent dangers.
173	15006	6	3	"I've been to the Empire state building before, right up to the top. The top was not opened, but several windows were, and our thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. Trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible. I was waiting for that factor to come up the whole story, and it finally did. ""The winds on top of the building work constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lusted 5). These gusts would make stabilizing a massive airship nearly impossible. In addition to parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang-plank, which would not be too fun and posed a serious safety hazard. Another problem they faced was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (Lusted 6) I would think that before spending sixty thousand dollars on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law-wise. When I read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start due to these fundamental and obvious flaws."
174	15007	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there for several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off, creating a revolutionary transit hub. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add immense stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below, requiring extensive and costly structural reinforcement. Third obstacle would be the choice of using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was tragically destroyed by fire, highlighting the catastrophic danger. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
175	15008	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted talks about The Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building of how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was flat, as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add dangerous stress to the building's frame, which was not designed for such dynamic loads. Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used; German dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It meant that the building and potentially a whole area of downtown New York could catch on fire. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building, making the entire venture legally questionable from its conception."
176	15009	6	3	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted explains the construction of the Empire State Building in New York. The excerpt explains the steps of building the building as well as the obstacles and challenges that the builders faced. The architects, in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, did not take into account the problems that may come with taking on such a large project. The creator of this plan to build a docking mast on the Empire State Building was Al Smith. Al Smith was so excited to build the mast, that he did not think about the complications associated with his ""master"" plan. Because of the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure, it was necessary for the building's frame to be strengthened which costed over sixty thousand dollars. The greatest obstacle for the builders was a matter of safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was known to be very flammable. If something like that happened over a densely populated area such as downtown New York, the consequences would be catastrophic. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking maneuvers extremely hazardous. Also there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This excerpt shows that before you leap on a large challenge, you should look and take into account obstacles that may come with that."
177	15010	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were multifaceted. The risk of accidents over densely populated areas was a primary concern, as any incident would endanger countless people on the ground. Furthermore, violent air currents at that altitude were constantly shifting, creating an unstable and dangerous environment for the large, slow-moving airships. These significant challenges ultimately contributed to the impracticality of the ambitious docking plan.
178	15011	6	3	"The idea to put a mast on top of the Empire State Building seemed like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, especially because ""New York City was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to see how the mooring mast would never be able to dock dirigibles. One reason this could never happen is because many of these dirigibles contained hydrogen in them which is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.... the Empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" Many people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" Therefore, even if everything was set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying their dirigibles so close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be too unpredictable above the Empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a totally unstable place to dock these dirigibles, rendering the concept fundamentally flawed from the start."
179	15012	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many problems. One of these problems was the building's frame. The frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast and the immense stress it would bear. Another huge obstacle was safety. The author states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to go up in flames, not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. It is explained that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload and creating a severe risk of collision with the mast itself. These were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, illustrating the project's inherent dangers."
180	15013	6	3	In the excerpt the builders had wanted dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They found that they couldn't do that for several critical reasons. The powerful winds at that great height would push the dirigibles in all different directions, making a safe and stable connection to the mast nearly impossible. And also there was a law that air crafts had to be a certain height in the air, which effectively prohibited them from flying low enough over the city to attempt a docking maneuver. These combined factors of nature and regulation made the entire concept unworkable in practice.
181	15014	6	3	When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. The top of the Empire State Building was intended to be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid; it was designed for the age of dirigibles. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States, and this influenced the building's design. Consequently, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, the structure was prepared for its intended, though ultimately impractical, role.
182	15015	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, requiring significant structural reinforcement. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason was safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. An existing law against airships flying too low presented another legal and logistical complication for the entire endeavor.
183	15016	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were the winds in the high altitudes, which were unpredictable and powerful, posing a significant challenge for docking an airship. They also had to contend with the laws that didn't allow airships to be so close to an urban area, creating a regulatory barrier. The safety of the passengers embarking and disembarking at such a great height was a primary concern, as was the safety of the pedestrians below in the dense city streets, should any accident occur. These combined factors made the ambitious plan for a dirigible terminal highly problematic from the outset.
184	15017	6	3	The building was big and beautiful, a monumental achievement in architecture and engineering that captured the spirit of its era. Its soaring height and elegant Art Deco design made it an instant icon on the New York City skyline, admired by people from around the world. The careful craftsmanship and ambitious scale of the construction reflected a profound confidence and a drive to push the boundaries of what was possible, creating a lasting landmark of great aesthetic and historical significance.
185	15018	6	3	It was unrealistic and also unsafe of engineers to think that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major problem with the idea was that the dirigible would add immense stress to the building's frame, which it was not originally designed to handle. Also, the combined weight of the dirigible and the force of the wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the entire skyscraper. Another critical issue was that many dirigibles were inflated with hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if one of them exploded it would have been a disaster for downtown New York. This is why the idea is neither practical nor safe, and it was ultimately abandoned as a functional aspect of the building's design.
186	15019	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents and the safety of pedestrians. One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the violent air currents. According to the excerpt, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting. So if a dirigible happened to get caught in this, they would be dangling high above pedestrians. An example of this would be, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This constant motion made a stable and safe docking procedure nearly impossible. Another obstacle was the safety of pedestrians. When owners heard about the German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided that it would be even worse if it had taken place in a heavily populated place like New York. An example of this would be, ""owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The potential for catastrophic loss of life became a paramount concern. In conclusion, the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", written by Marcia Amidon Lusted, illustrates that the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents and the safety of city pedestrians, which ultimately prevented the plan's success."
187	15020	6	3	The Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This building being so tall, and large wind shifts were a constant worry. Wind shifts occur when the direction of the wind changes suddenly. One minute it is blowing from the north, the next it is blowing from the south. These unpredictable gusts at such a high altitude posed a significant danger to the large, slow-moving airships. On May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, people thought, what would have happened if that was over the Empire State Building. Over New York, with such a large population, it would have been hectic and resulted in a far greater tragedy. Furthermore, airships weren't allowed to fly that low anyway due to existing aviation regulations. These combined factors of dangerous weather, public safety, and legal restrictions made the docking idea impractical.
188	15021	6	3	"The task of trying to allow dirigibles to dock 1,250 feet above ground over the city of New York not shockingly posed a few obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building. Before the dirigibles could even try to dock on the mast, the builders had to modify the whole building due to the stress and pressure on the building from the dirigibles. The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building. Once the builders finally had all the modifications and building done; they were faced with a whole new set of obstacles. Most of the dirigibles from out of the United States were filled with flammable hydrogen. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey"". This accident worried the building's owners, who feared a similar disaster occurring in the heart of Manhattan. Also they faced problems with the shifting winds and air currents that made it difficult to dock the dirigibles safely and securely. Another obstacle was the fact that laws existed against airships flying too low to the ground. Due to these unforeseen obstacles, the ambitious idea of docking dirigibles on top of the building eventually disappeared."
189	15022	6	3	Based on the information given in the excerpt, there are multiple obstacles that couldn't have been overcome by the builders of the Empire State Building. Between the winds, problems with anchoring, risk of fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested. One thing the builders hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarily huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the fact that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very flammable and if one was to ascend in a populated city, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people below would be doomed. More problems the architects faced were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the blimp, then it would cause millions of dollars of damage to the city and surrounding structures. Lastly, a new law was undergoing the legislation process. It prohibited the flying of any air travel below a certain number of feet in residential areas. This combination of natural, technical, and legal challenges proved insurmountable for the dirigible docking plan.
190	15023	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop it. One major obstacle was safety, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The owners quickly realized how dangerous an accident would be ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" where falling debris and fire would cause immense casualties. The second major obstacle was nature; ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". A thousand-foot dirigible moored atop the building would add enormous stress to the frame of the building from these powerful and unpredictable gusts. In the end these two obstacles would be too great. Times were changing and with the airplane taking over modern travel the dirigible and the mooring mast were doomed to become a historical footnote rather than a functioning transportation hub."
191	15024	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the building. They first had to modify this top as a mooring mast, and the steel frame of the building had to be structurally modified to accomadate the dirigible. They also had to make a specialized docking and ticketing area, which also costed money. They also had the problem if the dirigible hit something or caught fire by its volatile hydrogen gas. Nature itself was the biggest problem because near the building, winds were violent and unpredictable. There also was a law stating that dirigibles or airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas, which presented a significant legal hurdle. If the shell broke, the dirigible could hurt many people, making the entire concept a public safety risk. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved too great to overcome for regular operations.
192	15025	6	3	When building a structer as big as the Empire state building and even having it dock a Dirigible to the top of it means there will be challenges to face. In order for It dock, significant structural changes were necessary. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, requiring immense strength. The building would have to be reinforced throughout its entire frame. All these problems must be taken into consideration, from material strength to aerodynamic forces. This would mean spending more money on specialized engineering and construction, increasing the project's overall budget significantly. The financial implications were a major factor in the feasibility of the docking plan.
193	15026	6	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they had great intentions but faced some obstacles along the way. This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the buildings frame. All of the stress would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, so they would have to modify and strengthen the steel framework extensively. This would cost over @MONEY1, and thats a lot for a feature that might not be used frequently. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the wind up at the top was constantly shifting and creating dangerous conditions. This wouldn't be safe either for the airship or the people below. There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock legally. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire. The main obsticle for the builders was saftey when they were building this, there were many unsafe outcomes so it was too risky to construct and operate.
194	15027	6	3	One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the construction of the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height and the forces involved. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside and provide the necessary support. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas nearby civilization was considered unreasonable and a severe fire hazard. Thus, a law was passed that forbid the transportation of dirigibles close to the public, effectively preventing the mast's use. Nature was also against the architects, and so posed a safety hazard when high-speed winds attempted to @CAPS1 the dirigibles from the sky while being weighed down with lead weights, making a stable docking procedure nearly impossible. In the end, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never used due to these issues, remaining as a monument to an ambitious but impractical idea.
195	15028	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect from the beginning. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety of the public and the passengers. The hydrogen in them is highly flammable and after the accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened right in New York over a densely populated area. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes, which were becoming more reliable and did not pose the same level of catastrophic risk. The dream of a dirigible terminal atop the skyscraper was ultimately abandoned for practical and safety reasons.
196	15029	6	3	"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the stress added to the building's frame when the dirigible was moored at the top of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to rearrange the frame to make it work, a significant structural challenge. Consequently, the workers were never able to accomplish the goal. Safety was a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building; dirigibles were highly flammable which could have caused a serious accident to occur. However, the ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" At such a high altitude, there were heavy air currents above the building, it would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast. There was also an existing law that prohibited planes to fly low over city areas, which made it impossible for dirigibles to reach the building. As a result of all these obstacles, the main goal to dock dirigibles was not achieved."
197	15030	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it. One problem they faced was that if something happened to the dirigible, like the Hindenburg disaster, then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. It was also a problem with passengers because in a dense city they could easily crash into other structures. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tried to get close enough it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building. Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up, wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast. The final obstacle builders would have to overcome was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles from flying low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building then they would have been doing so illegally, presenting an insurmountable legal barrier."
198	15031	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. First was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building."" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, sixty thousand dollars worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure. The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps"". To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at, highlighting the immense complexity of the project."
199	15032	6	3	"Various obstacles came up in this excerpt. This building of the mooring mast simply went from a dream to more of a way to win a record for the world's tallest building. The greatest obstacle they faced was the issue of safety. In paragraph nine it reads ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Consequently, an obstacle faced was the danger of the dirigible being destroyed by fire while trying to dock on the Empire State Building which would cause a large amount of destruction in New York. The builders also faced the problem of nature itself. The violent air currents at these heights would cause the dirigible to swerve around the mooring mast. The builders also faced a legal issue stating in paragraph ten ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore, the dirigibles were never going to be allowed to fly so close to the Empire State Building anyway. These were the significant obstacles faced by the builders."
200	15033	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph nine it states ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof."" This obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building. Another reason as stated in paragraph ten ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This shows this was another major obstacle for the builders. Another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in paragraph eleven ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" this could be very dangerous. If the back of the ship was dangling over the streets surrounding the empire state building there could be many safety hazards for people below. These obstacles were the main obstacles the builders had to face if the Empire State building would be a landing dock, and they ultimately proved too great to overcome."
201	15034	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as safety, nature, and legislation. First, it would be difficult to safely allow foreign dirigibles to dock. In paragraph four it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This displays that the risk of fire, and therefore the issue of public safety, was a primary obstacle. Next, unpredictable air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The turbulent air near the top of the skyscraper was affected by powerful air currents, so it was extremely difficult for pilots to land with precision. Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" There was simply no way to work with or combat the constant uncertainty of the wind, so nature itself proved to be a formidable obstacle. Finally, there were existing laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph six it says, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The very purpose of the mooring mast would be illegal, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable challenges regarding the mooring mast, and its opening for this purpose was never successful as a result of them."
202	15035	6	3	"In the short excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial obstacle they faced was the lack of physical space. An example from the text states, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area,"" highlighting that it was going to be hard finding a large, clear place to land a massive airship. Although that may have been one of their problems, that was not the only issue; a more critical problem was the matter of safety. The excerpt says, ""the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on."" Which meant it would have taken a long time just to land and complete fueling, thereby increasing the window for potential accidents. Another obstacle was the need for the dirigibles themselves to be tested in conjunction with the testing of the mast, a process fraught with its own difficulties. These combined challenges ultimately prevented the ambitious plan from becoming a practical reality."
203	15036	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle was finding a safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area so any type of accident would be horrific, as the owners realized after the Hindenburg disaster, as noted in the text: ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident couldve been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as Manhattan."" Another major obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong and unpredictable, as it says in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currants. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" This made a stable and secure docking virtually impossible. While several issues were considered, safety was clearly the biggest and most decisive concern that led to the project's abandonment."
204	15037	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were substantial and ultimately insurmountable. One major legal hurdle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, and there was a legitimate fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in that area. Such a collision would severely harm the dirigible's gas-filled shell and cause a catastrophe. Then another incident occurred when a dirigible attempted a publicity stunt, where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State building; this attempt also failed to demonstrate feasibility. Consequently, the entire idea of the mooring mast was shelved. The yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a great height made the venture undesirable despite its initial appeal. As a result, the highest open observatory dock, which was intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public, standing as a testament to the failed ambition.
205	15038	6	3	"The builder's main problem was with safety. Most blimps that aren't made in the United States are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster like the Hindenburg accident happened while the blimp was moving toward the tethers at the Empire State building, the outcome would have been much more disasterous, raining debris and fire onto the crowded streets below. Another significant obstacle is the powerful and unpredictable winds at that altitude. According to the excerpt ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making a stable connection perilous. One final obstacle was the legal restriction, specifically the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The text confirms that ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, the builders faced many interconnected obstacles by attempting to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building, ensuring the plan never moved beyond a conceptual stage."
206	15039	6	3	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the excerpt says, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" This shows that builders had to build a mooring mast to have some time for refueling or service and have people get off and on safely. Another example from the excerpt is when it says, ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform."" This shows that the builders constructed a gangplank so people could walk up or down safely from the dirigible, even as it moved in the wind. These specific design features were necessary to address the unique challenges of docking a large, buoyant aircraft to a skyscraper, though the concept ultimately proved impractical."
207	15040	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many different obstacles. One was the building's immense height. It is one of the tallest buildings in the world, so any construction plan that goes wrong could be tragic for all the people below. When they started construction on the mooring mast, they knew there was some risk but didn't think it through completely. All this was introduced because Al Smith wanted the Empire State to be the biggest. Now he didn't fully look into it; if a blimp was to dock on the mooring mast, they would have to worry about weather, wind, and also the strength of the building's foundation. Also, they would have to worry about the blimp itself. Back then, dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, and if something was to go wrong over downtown New York and the blimp was to catch a spark, it would burn four city blocks. This potential for a catastrophic fire presented a severe and ultimately insurmountable danger.
208	15041	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the problems are that some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a blimp with hydrogen in it exploded over a populated area like New York City, that would not turn out so good for the people there. Those people could die. Also, one blimp, the Hindenburg, exploded in New Jersey; the blimp had hydrogen in it. So when that happened, they thought a lot about the docking station and decided only to allow blimps with helium in them to dock there. This restriction, however, limited the number of airships that could potentially use the mast, as helium was less common and many foreign dirigibles relied on the more volatile hydrogen.
209	15042	6	3	The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was laden with problems ranging from natural preventions to pre-existing laws. During the time of frequent dirigible travel in the world, a German dirigible called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a complication with fire. This catastrophe revealed to the workers a problem they had previously overlooked, the fact that most foreign dirigibles were inflated with flammable hydrogen gas. The idea of a problem like the Hindenburg occurring over one of the most densely populated cities in the world ruled out the idea. The workers of this project also overlooked the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the Empire State Building was anticipated to be the tallest building in the world, the soon-to-be-created mast would still be too close to the millions of people in the city. After test runs had occurred to try out the new mooring system, it was seen that dirigibles were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong winds. The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another building's spire put fear into the minds of the people. The combination of this variety of problems, from safety hazards to legal and practical difficulties, put a definitive end to the idea of using a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building.
210	15043	6	3	"Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was designing strengthening beams for the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. The second was that the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, @NUM1). The intense air currents around the building would either cause the dirigible to spin, or require the use of added lead weights which would ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (L¸sted, @NUM2). Among all of these problems ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (L¸sted, @NUM3). Therefore, not only was the docking concept unsafe and impractical, it was also illegal, creating a final, legal barrier that could not be overcome."
211	15044	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem that the workers faced was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible... would add Stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). This meant that the frame would have to be Strengthened, requiring significant structural modifications. Another obstacle they came across was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). Therefore, the it would be illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would be too low down, creating an immediate legal barrier. Finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM3). This made it unsafe and unpractical because the dirigibles would be above pedestrians on the street, risking a catastrophic accident. Due to all of the complications and challenges that faced the workers who were trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the project was never completed and the mooring mast remained unused."
212	15045	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that it was unsafe. It was unsafe because the dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant fire hazard. In the excerpt it says the greatest obstacle was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building was constantly shifting and the back of the airship would swivel around, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over the urban areas, which directly prohibited the planned docking procedure. These are the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had faced, ultimately dooming the ambitious plan."
213	15046	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One main reason was that it was illegal for dirigibles to dock. ""Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", @CAPS1 @NUM1. Also mother nature prevented dirigibles ability to dock there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", @CAPS1 @NUM2. However some dirigibles attempted to dock. In 1930 the U.S. Navy, Los Angeles tried to dock, but due to the severe winds could not. New York was a very densely populated area, and having explosive hydrogen floating low over the city could cause a huge threat. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" This showed the builders and owners of the Empire State Building that it was very dangerous for dirigibles trying to dock there. A main set of problems the builders faced was making the building itself strong enough to allow dirigibles to dock. The builders had to modify the frame of the Empire State Building and design a custom mooring device, which proved to be a complex engineering challenge. The builders were faced with legal and safety problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, and the concept was ultimately abandoned."
214	15047	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time (@DATE1's) believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success and the idea was finally scrapped."
215	15048	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Throughout the excerpt the author states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"" (paragraph @NUM1). This means that builders had to work harder and figure out ways to get this to work, investing considerable time and resources. Architects and engineers talked with experts about the equipment needed to build the dirigibles. The author also states that they asked people to test the dirigible. They had to work on the mooring mast in order to get the dirigible to work properply. Getting the mooring mast to work was very difficult for the builders, as it required precise engineering. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" referring to the unpredictable and powerful winds at such a great height. Dirigibles were basically given up on by the 1930's, rendering the entire docking project obsolete."
216	15049	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. They dealt with the physical frames and structural shapes, but there were other reasons that were not so physical. One of the greatest obstacles they faced was nature itself. At the very top of the building, winds were constantly shifting due to violent and unpredictable air currents. Using the Empire State Building, where the blimps would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street level, was simply not safe. Another particular obstacle they faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to ever tie up the blimp to the Empire State Building itself. Furthermore, the blimps couldn't land on the flat roof of the building as they required a specialized docking procedure. The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of obstacles in front of them, not just physical objects to make it easier for the dirigibles to land, but the formidable challenges of politics and nature as well, which ultimately proved insurmountable for the intended purpose.
217	15050	6	3	"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, there were a lot of examples of obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was the immense weight and pressure of a dirigible pulling on a single tether at the top of the Empire State Building. This was a big concern because all the stress and pressure of the rope would pull on the building, sending the force all the way to the bottom of the building one thousand feet below, potentially straining the entire structure. Another obstacle that the workers faced was nature itself. This was a problem because of the high-speed winds at the building's pinnacle, which were shifting all the time. If a dirigible was to be tethered at the top by only one rope in the front, the back of it would be free to move in the wind. This would allow the tail section to be blown about, creating the dangerous possibility of it hitting the building's facade. In conclusion, there were many significant obstacles builders had to face to attempt this ambitious but ultimately impractical project."
218	15051	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted there were many obstacles that the workers had to face to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. One of the many obstacles the workers faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the building; it required complex integration into the structural design. Also, the thousand-foot dirigibles moored at the top of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge. A single cable tether held the dirigible and it would add tremendous stress to the building's frame, a force for which the skyscraper was not originally designed. The biggest obstacle the workers would face was the operation of the mooring mast on top of the building with all the winds shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Another obstacle was that dirigibles were typically moored in open fields where they were weighted down in the back, a procedure unsuitable for an urban skyscraper where the airships would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Those are the obstacles the workers faced, which collectively prevented the concept from becoming a functional reality."
219	15052	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature, safety, and the law. Al Smith, the former governor of New York who headed the construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for dirigibles. In building the mooring mast, however, came significant obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth dangerously. Lead weights were typically used to keep the airships from swaying, but if used here, these heavy weights would be dangling a thousand feet above pedestrians' heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable; if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas,"" which would make the mooring mast's very purpose illegal. Today, the mast is nothing more but a decorative spire, a testament to an ambitious idea that was overcome by its many practical challenges."
220	15053	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a significant chance that a dirigible could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles at the time were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They realized how much catastrophic damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents, making a stable mooring procedure incredibly hazardous. Lastly, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it closely. Instead of becoming the transportation hub of the future, the idea had disappeared completely. They faced too many profound obstacles that simply could not be overcome, rendering the mooring mast an architectural novelty."
221	15054	6	3	They ran into a few problems when it came to building this docking system. They realized after initial planning that it wasnt that smart or that safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102 floor building just by one cable tether, as a single point of failure presented an immense risk. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldnt control mother nature. If it was a really windy day out it would be hard to keep the massive airship steady, causing it to swing dangerously. And if there wasnt enough support on the building frames to handle the dynamic loads, then the entire structure could potentially collapse from the strain. These fundamental issues proved too great to overcome for the ambitious plan.
222	15055	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's bag to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other nearby skyscrapers. On top of that, many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen instead of the safer helium, making them highly flammable and a fire hazard in an urban environment. Also, the added stress and sheer weight of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked the masonry or collapsed the building and its foundation under the unexpected load. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease serious production of the mast as a functional idea, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers vying for a record.
223	15056	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. Lack of a suitable and secure landing area was a tough obstacle from the start. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas, creating an immediate legal barrier. It would be dangling high above people on the streets and it wouldn't be safe for those below. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable, introducing a major danger. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe from any angle and the builders would have to think of a new plan; therefore, there would be many obstacles that ultimately proved insurmountable for the project.
224	15057	6	3	During the 1930s, technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced as it is today. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had some significant obstacles. One of them were, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable, they had no idea how to achieve this in practice. They simply did not have the specialized knowledge or the necessary technology to do such a complex thing back then. The ambitious concept was ultimately beyond the technical capabilities of the era, leading to its abandonment as a practical endeavor.
225	15058	6	3	"There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem that was addressed was the fact that dirigibles all over the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This was a significant problem because on May 6, 1937 a dirigible was destroyed by fire and the owners of the Empire State building relized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place of a densely populated area."" Another potential problem were the strong wind currents on top of the building, as described in contemporary reports. The concern was that these strong currents would prevent a dirigible from docking securely, and could possibly blow it into another building. This could puncture the dirigible's material and cause a horrifying accident. The final obstacle that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that ""airships flying to low over urban areas"" was prohibited, creating a legal blockade. There were many obstacles, from safety to legality, that collectively prevented dirigibles from ever docking on the Empire State Building."
226	15059	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by the building's designers, the builder of the Empire State Building faced many significant challenges during the building of the Empire State Building. The primary obstacle would be the wind. Because the building was so high, and the more up you went the more air and wind they had to contend with, it made it difficult to stop a dirigible from landing or dropping off passengers. A dirigible is also a balloon or blimp, but they are different because the dirigibles can be controlled by propellers. Another reason was the inadequate equipment. They didn't have the right equipment to dock the dirigible safely and securely. So they ultimately refrained from letting them dock there ever again. They also decided to stop it because it's over hundreds of civilians and if something goes wrong, the balloon could fall on the civilians, causing a catastrophe. Those are the reasons why in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by the building's designers, they had to face insurmountable problems with docking balloons."
227	15060	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is the use of hydrogen gas. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the builders realized that hydrogen is flammable, they had to rethink the construction plans, for if there was a fire it would be much more dangerous in a populated area like New York. The chances of people getting hurt or injured are more likely in such a scenario. Another obstacle was a legal one, as ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building [because] of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. This was a major obstacle because the builders would have been violating a law, and it would also be very dangerous to attempt such an operation illegally."
228	15061	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramatically shifting because of the unpredictable air currents. Because of this, the dirigible's end would swivel wildly around the top of the building, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Another issue was the safety of the people walking the streets of New York below the building. To stop a dirigible from moving, heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problematic because one of the weights could very easily come loose and fall, posing a grave danger to anyone below. Furthermore, the law that prohibited a flying airship from lingering too low over a city would be broken if a dirigible had been stationed at the Empire State building, presenting a final legal barrier to the plan.
229	15062	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prominent issue; if human lives are at risk, an idea is not likely to be successful. Most foreign dirigibles contained hydrogen, an element that is ""highly flammable"" and posed a threat to not only the passengers but the people at the docking station as well. Another potential obstacle was the violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to blow around freely with the wind, making a controlled mooring extremely difficult. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the dirigible with lead weights was dangerous; lead weights would be left ""dangling high above pedestrians"" on the streets below. A final and very obvious obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre-existing law prohibiting airships that fly ""too low over urban areas."" Even with a safe docking station, landing would be illegal. Although it may have seemed like a feasible plan at the time, the idea of dirigibles docking on the top of the Empire State Building was not a safe or practical one in the end."
230	15063	6	3	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future."" One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which posed a significant structural challenge. The builders would have to pay a considerable sum to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped entirely."
231	15064	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Irving Clavan noted that ""the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"". This quote highlights that the primary challenge was the immense height of the mast, which introduced significant technical difficulties that had not been overcome. The sheer altitude complicated the docking process, making it a dangerous and complex endeavor. Furthermore, the issue of safety was paramount, as ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamible."" This was a critical concern because any accident involving a hydrogen-filled airship, such as a fire or a crash, would have catastrophic consequences given the location above one of the most populated cities in America. These are some of the formidable obstacles the builders had to face, which ultimately contributed to the project's impracticality."
232	15065	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A primary obstacle was the inherent danger of hydrogen gas, which they realized was very flammable. An example from the excerpt is the reference to a German dirigible that caught on fire; the builders then contemplated how much worse such a disaster would have been over a densely populated area like New York City. Another significant obstacle was the practical use of the mooring mast itself. The winds at the top of the building were harsh and unpredictable, creating a hazardous environment that made precise landing maneuvers incredibly difficult for the large, slow-moving airships. Compounding these issues was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier to the entire operation. Confronted with these combined safety, practical, and regulatory challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles."
233	15066	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One structural obstacle they faced was that if a thousand-foot dirigible was moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether, the immense force and leverage would add significant stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its integrity. Another critical safety obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a constant risk of a catastrophic fire. However, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, creating an unstable and treacherous environment for docking. Even if a dirigible were successfully tethered to the mooring mast, the powerful and variable winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel wildly around the fixed point. Those are some of the key obstacles they faced while trying to dock a dirigible on the building, each presenting a formidable challenge to the project's feasibility.
234	15067	6	3	There seemed to be many problems erupting during the planning of the dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building. For one, the Empire State Building's natural structure was deemed insufficient to handle the immense weight and dynamic forces of a moored airship. Therefor, architects had to design and construct a specialized stainless steel tower to serve as the mooring mast. Even after this structure was made, they realized the extreme danger posed by the flammable gases, helium and especially hydrogen, used in dirigibles. Not only were the gases a fire hazard, but the air currents and winds at the top of that building were also extremely violent, making any landing attempt perilous. The ambitious idea was eventually forgotten about and abandoned due to the multitude of possible accidents that could happen, rendering the concept too dangerous to pursue.
235	15068	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in building a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock on. The first obstacle was the inadequate framework on the building itself because with a mooring mast on top, the force of a tethered dirigible would add tremendous stress to the building's structure. It is said that ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" which also represented a significant financial cost. Secondly, building a mooring mast for dirigibles over densely populated New York City would be extremely unsafe. Dirigibles from foreign countries used hydrogen to keep them afloat, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" As evidenced by the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, any fire above heavily populated New York City would have had disastrous effects. Next, the worst obstacle the builders faced was the winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Tethering a one thousand foot long dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building would be very unsafe because the winds would blow the back of the dirigible, therefore swivelling the entire ship around the mast. The final obstacle was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which created a legal barrier even if the technical challenges were overcome. All these obstacles the builders faced led to the ultimate failure and abandonment of the mast for its intended purpose."
236	15069	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later on. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This structural reinforcement was essential, as the Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having these essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars and was a significant initial investment. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles safely. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe for the public below. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would be directly violating this law, creating a legal barrier. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast, leading to these insurmountable problems."
237	15070	6	3	When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue concerning the gas used for lift. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium, which was more readily available at the time. Hydrogen is very flammable and poses a significant fire hazard. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster for the densely populated area below. Another obsticle was nature, specifically the weather conditions at such a great height. The wind was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging in the wind, unable to remain stable. If the wind got to strong it could add a lot of stress to the building's structure and it could colapse under the strain. One last reason was an actual law that had been overlooked. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, which directly applied to any attempt to dock. The mooring dock on the building would have never worked due to this combination of safety, natural, and legal challenges.
238	15071	6	3	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had many obstacles to face. Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than the United States, so they used hydrogen instead of helium, which was more common domestically. Hydrogen is very flammable so if it caught on fire it would go down in a very populated area, creating a catastrophic risk. Another obstacle was the environmental conditions at the building's summit. At that height, the wind was very strong and violent, posing a significant challenge for docking. When tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast, making a secure connection impossible. The last obstacle was a legal one; there was a law stating that dirigibles can not fly too low over urban areas. This regulation made it impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building legally. These combined issues ensured the mooring mast would never be used for its intended purpose.
239	15072	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was one of safety, most blimps outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a major fire hazard. Another obstacle the builders faced, was nature itself and the weather conditions at the skyscraper's peak. The winds on top of the building are always changing because of dangerous air currents, making the environment unpredictable. These winds would cause the rear end of the blimp to move around and around the mooring mast, preventing a stable dock. A third obstacle they faced was a legal restriction; a law stated that aircrafts couldn't fly too low over pedestrian filled areas. This law makes it illegal to tie up to the Empire State Building, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. Together, these factors of safety, nature, and law prevented the dirigible docking plan from ever becoming a reality.
240	15073	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, including nature, safety, and the law, when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' first imediate concern was for the structure of the building itself. When moured, the dirigible ""would add stress to the building,"" creating a significant engineering challenge. To counteract this added weight and force, the building would need to be modified and strengthened from its original design. The builders were also worried about safety, a concern heightened after a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire. Since the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft are highly flamable and downtown New York is so densely populated, they realized this could be very dangerous for the city below. The greatest obstacle was the high winds on top of the building that, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be swiveling in the wind uncontrollably. While lead weights could be used in open landing fields to stabilize an airship, these would be neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the streets. Lastly, there was a law existing stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the building without breaking the law. The combination of these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the Empire State Building, rendering the ambitious plan unworkable."
241	15074	6	3	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury, making the entire concept ultimately unworkable."
242	15075	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to face where rational, but there are some things you sould think of first, such as peoples safty, aircraft hight limets, and wind. They they thought about how to dock it, How to get the passengers safly to the landing area. What they did work on was smart though, they had the the thing that connects the dirigibles to the dock, the electric winch. They had a baggage, and ticket area. What they thought of was smart, but the other stuff first, meaning the fundamental safety and legal issues ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a practical reality.
243	15076	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top. In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were @NUM1 attempts the board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that airships from flying close to urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges, and the mast was never used for its intended purpose.
244	15077	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in atempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The bigest obstacle is to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. One set of engineers and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of moooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to vilant air currents. These are some of the many obsticles of the Empire State building faced wile atempting to alow dirigibles to dock there, which proved insurmountable for the ambitious project.
245	15078	6	3	The following are obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. They were worried about the hydrogen and the helium being highly flammable and considering the disaster The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. They were also worried about the back weight of the ship. And they feared wind would be blowing it into the spires of the building which would puncture the blimp shell. These combined dangers of fire, instability, and structural damage created a risk profile that was simply too great for the dirigible docking plan to proceed.
246	15079	6	3	Many significant obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders consistently put reality before theory in order to pick the safest possible route in docking a dirigible. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable and volatile. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was catastrophically destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders could clearly realize how dangerous it could be putting that immense risk in such a densely populated area such as New York. The greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature itself. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and gusting due to violent air currents surrounding the skyscraper. This would dangerously sway the massive ship around the mooring mast, becoming a serious hazard. The entire mooring mast project came to a definitive hault in the late 1930s, a necessary decision made in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe from potential disaster.
247	15080	6	3	There are many reasons why the builder's faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt, it states that most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. A fire caused by the hydrogen could destroy the Empire State building and devastate downtown New York. Another reason why the builder's faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was directly against the law. The excerpt further states there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, as this could be dangerous to the citizens of downtown New York. These combined factors of extreme physical danger and legal restrictions made the plan ultimately unworkable.
248	15081	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced many complex obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such immense height. Dirigibles, mostly those originating from outside of the U.S., were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas which was very dangerous above a highly populated area such as downtown Manhattan. Safety was a major concern, and a catastrophic accident like the Hindenburg disaster was something they simply did not want to risk. The practical ability of docking a lightweight flyer was also very difficult. With the strong winds at that altitude, after the tether cable was attached, the back end of the air craft would be blown around, making the aviator of the blimp hard to control and stabilize. Also, a law stating aircrafts may not fly too low to the buildings was strictly enforced, especially after the tragic incident of the Hindenburg in New Jersey, as a blimp could possibly hit a spire of another building. The reality of docking these lightweight aircrafts was a major safety and difficult concern, and these significant obstacles are what the builders of the empire state building ultimately faced and could not overcome.
249	15082	6	3	The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be the tallest building in the world, at a record-breaking height. Everything was going well until the competition emerged. The Chrysler Building threatened to steal the title, prompting a change in plans. When Al Smith announced that he was going to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously changed the architects designs significantly. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. Two months after the workers started with the new plan, they celebrated because they finished framing the entire building. However, the Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed, with the greatest reason being public safety.
250	15083	6	3	There were many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle was that the building's structural frame was not initially prepared for it. As stated, a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add tremendous stress to the buildings frame. The frame of the building simply could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of structural modifications would have had to be made. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States used hydrogen instead of helium to make their dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders rightly figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a densely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the winds on top of the building that were constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currents. While the dirigible was tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City. From the very beginning, the ambitious idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately a ridiculous and impractical notion.
251	15084	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. They had to do this because the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, requiring significant structural reinforcement. Another obstacle they had to face was that they had to add two more floors to the building to make a grand total of 102 floors. The 101st floor was a glassed-in observation area and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor, which was intended to serve as the docking level. These structural and design challenges were significant hurdles in realizing the ambitious plan for an aerial terminal.
252	15085	6	3	"The builders that were attempting to build a dock on the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles. First, the dirigibles were similar to huge balloons; they were composed of hydrogen and helium. In the expert it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (pg @NUM1.) Consequently, if a dirigible caught on fire while it was stationed near the Empire State Building, it may also catch the building on fire, resulting in a hazardous environment for the employees and passengers. Next, attempting to tie down dirigibles to a building is known to be illegal. On the expert it states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If anyone disobeyed this law it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new obstacle the builders would have to deal with. Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building is extremely unsafe. ""The @CAPS2 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted gives an excellent third reason why airships are unsafe, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" If a disaster ever took place, many lives would have been lost or severely injured. Finally, the builders and architect would have an extremely hard time convincing high government officials to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building because the bad certainly overpowers the good, making the entire venture impractical."
253	15086	6	3	There is a lot of obstacles in trying to come with an idea of a building designed for dirigible docking. They had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of withstanding the high winds it was going to get at such a great height. Plus, they also had to make sure the top was safe enough for the dirigibles to dock there without harming any people or the building itself. This required careful planning and engineering to ensure the docking platform could securely handle the large and volatile airships. Ultimately, the inherent dangers and technical difficulties presented significant challenges to the feasibility of the project.
254	15087	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"" was a primary concern. They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land, which required a large, clear space at the summit. Second, they needed to ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldn't break under the additional forces exerted by a moored airship. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting""; if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower or develop a method to secure the vessels safely in turbulent conditions. Hence, the builders confronted significant engineering and environmental challenges in their ambitious plan."
255	15088	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings out ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building, creating unpredictable and hazardous conditions. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel which could very well be dangerous for both the airship and the structure. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated state; the explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would lose a lot of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building underwent many challenges in trying to allow dirigibles to dock, and these fundamental issues of safety and physics ultimately proved insurmountable for the concept."
256	15089	6	3	"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occur to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimp in different directions. Without the proper framework, it would be extremely dangerous to dock, as the immense force could compromise the structural integrity. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps, highlighting the inherent risk. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in such a ""densely populated area,"" potentially causing catastrophic loss of life. The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock reliably. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp with lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe."" Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea initially. As time went on the obstacles preventing this became too great and finally shut down the idea, rendering the mooring mast an unused landmark."
257	15090	6	3	Based on the excerpt there are a few key obstacles the builders face, one being the safety of the people in the dirigibles and people below them, and two being nature itself. The safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use. There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below, or a catastrophic fire breaking out. The greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wrapped around the building due to powerful gusts, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind, making a stable approach nearly impossible. Overall the mooring mast was not a practical idea. It was just something thought up to compete with the Chrysler Building, and was not thought through with the aspects of safety in mind, ultimately serving as a testament to ambition over practicality.
258	15091	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One important issue was the Mooring Mast. According to the architectural plans, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Another problem would be the dirigible's load. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" requiring immense structural support. One of the main things the architects forgot to take into consideration was the building's frame. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" involving significant and costly retrofitting. These fundamental engineering challenges proved immense. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, and the concept was ultimately abandoned as unfeasible."
259	15092	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City,"" making them incredibly difficult to maneuver in an urban environment. Another obstacle was the weight of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bear the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant financial undertaking. Safety was also an issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York then the accident would be much worse. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast, creating an uncontrollable and hazardous situation. These combined factors made the entire proposition dangerously impractical."
260	15093	6	3	Allowing dirigibles was going to be the new way of transportation back in the 1920s. There were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the Empire State Building. One of the main problems was it was flammable. The helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles were highly combustible. If there was the smallest spark the entire dirigible would go up in flames in a second. For an example, The Hindenburg, a German zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937, served as a grim warning. So the thought if that had happened in a more densely populated area like downtown New York it would have been much worse, with devastation on an unimaginable scale. Another problem with the dirigibles was wind. If there was strong air currents the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked. Also, it is weighed down by lead weights. If it is over pedestrians it is not safe, posing a constant threat to those below. Consequently, the visionary plan was never realized due to these insurmountable dangers.
261	15094	6	3	Based on the excerpt from the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in building the mooring mast. For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted to accomplish. The law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock, making the entire concept legally problematic from the start. Another problem the builders faced was the inherent danger surrounding the airships that would be docking there. The airships, called dirigibles, were like giant balloons and could easily pop if they touched something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long, sharp spires on top. Therefore, if a dirigible bumped one of these spires, it could pop and go plummeting to the ground. This presented another, even more terrifying problem. Had an airship popped in New York City, it could've killed a large number of people not only in it, but on the ground. During the time of building, the Hindenburg crashed into open fields, yet it still killed all of it's passengers. The builders thought what the catastrophic consequences would be if that had happened in the densely populated city. This was the final straw for the builders as they ultimately abandoned their lofty goal, because of too many insurmountable problems.
262	15095	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The fabric that they use for dirigibles is very light and fragile, making them vulnerable. ""Cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" This delicate construction meant that even a minor collision could lead to disaster. They also imply that the architects did not try hard enough to solve the fundamental problems, perhaps due to the overwhelming nature of the challenges. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."" and thus remained an unused architectural feature, a testament to a failed ambition."
263	15096	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some significant obstacles in attempting to have a dirigible dock at its pinnacle. The dock would break the existing laws which prohibited low-flying airships over urban areas, creating an immediate legal barrier. The dock would also be a profound danger to the people below, as a crashing airship would cause immense casualties on the crowded city streets. Furthermore, the act of mooring a massive, buoyant airship would also put a lot of stress on the steel frame of the building itself, posing a structural risk that the engineers had to consider. These combined issues proved too great to overcome.
264	15097	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the terrible winds at that great height. In the excerpt it states how bad the winds are, creating unpredictable and hazardous conditions. One dirigible that was going to try to dock there was the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles, but it couldn't get close enough because of the very strong and gusty winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's fragile shell. Another reason was there was already a law that stated against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it closely. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of a catastrophic crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey with the Hindenburg and they realized how much worse an accident like that would be in such a densely populated area like downtown New York City. And that is the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The huge wind gusts, the existing law, and the terrifying consequences of a dirigible crash in the area of New York City ultimately doomed the project."
265	15098	6	3	When constructing a building, workers will face tough obstacles, especially when it comes to building an innovative structure like the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems that ultimately prevented the plan's success. As stated in the text, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would be necessary for docking. Also, as stated, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents created by the urban canyon effect, making precise maneuvering nearly impossible. Both of these obstacles were primary reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, and the mast never served its intended purpose.
266	15099	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium make them lighter than air."" The first problem is that it's material could be broken if happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" did not help. Since the dirigibles could not be weighted down at the Empire State Building, using heavy lead weights to stabilize them, it would be dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with hydrogen and helium, ""most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With these significant obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there, the ambitious theory did not work out in reality."
267	15100	6	3	"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen, which posed a grave risk. Also, a German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey, providing a stark warning. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Furthermore, the winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were violent and unpredictable. It is stated in paragraph four teen, ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting."" With such hazardous conditions, it would not be safe to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building, leading to the abandonment of the plan."
268	15101	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" many obstacles created problems for the builders of the Empire State building and their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle that came across the builder's minds was that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" (paragraph @NUM1) because it would damage the building with the ammount of pressure pulling on the structure. The second problem that the architects faced was safety. Events from the past such as Hindenburg was caused by the use of ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable...the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could've been."" The next problem that came up was nature itself, such as dangerous winds. An event when ""the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 there were legal issues, and an existing law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to operate near the building."
269	15102	6	3	"The builders of the Empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" These combined issues ultimately made the venture impractical."
270	15103	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, @CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast, sealing the fate of the ambitious project.
271	15104	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. One problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and actually caused a dirigible, such as the Hindenburg, to be destroyed by a catastrophic fire. Also, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a dirigible to stop swiveling around the mast—a significant safety hazard for pedestrians below. Lastly, it was illegal for aircraft of any sort to fly so low over urban areas, which legally prevented the approach of any airship. At first, the idea of the mooring mast was well-liked, but in the end, it had too many fundamental problems and proved to be entirely impractical.
272	15105	6	3	In the 1930's the world was evolving and new technologies were coming of age. One of these technologies was the dirigible, and some people thought to expand its use. One of these ideas was the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. This was a great idea, but the things that stood in its way made it impossible. A major problem was the safety, considering it was 1,250 feet up. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crash into the ground and kill everyone under it. Another huge problem was the winds and ease of pushing it off course. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which could easily push a massive airship off its intended path. These winds made it simply impossible for this to happen. One problem that should have been looked at from the beginning was the law. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. While this mooring mast was a fantastic idea, there were too many insurmountable things standing in its way.
273	15106	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the author describes complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. It was planned as the world's tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building, so the race for height was intense. There was a competition as to who had the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle was the safety and dirigibles. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The owner didn't want to risk an accident that would cost people's lives, as it would have been terrible publicity for them. The obstacles that the builders went through were a positive thing, as it made them more cautious and open their eyes to the real-world risks involved."
274	15107	6	3	There are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. This means that the winds on top of the building were strong and would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast dangerously if tethered. Also, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the concept futile from a legal standpoint. This shows that it was a waste of time thinking ships could moor at the State Building because there is a clear law against it. There still are many obstacles you have to overcome for any project, and this one was no exception.
275	15108	6	3	Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles that prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstacle was that it lacked safety. Dirigibles are highly flammable machines when used with hydrogen, and a fire in a densely populated area like New York City would be tragic. Another obstacle that the Mooring Mast faced was nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with an electric winch, allowing the dirigibles to move freely. When the winds were to blow on this situation, the dirigibles would swivel around and around the mast, which would cause tension to build on the building's frame and lead to a very unsafe environment. The last reason was that there was a law created that stated it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safety reasons, leaving the whole Mooring Mast to be ultimately unusable and impractical.
276	15109	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were multifaceted, beginning with the competition to create a bigger building than the Chrysler Building. Designing the mast and confronting the reality of the situation proved difficult. Al Smith needed a way to make his building bigger than the Chrysler building, and he came up with the idea of putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great in theory. While designing the mast, however, the architects realized they couldn't just place the mast right on top of the building; they'd have to modify the foundation to support the additional structure and stress. After changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two months later the mast was finished, but the architects had forgotten a critical fact: most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. All the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used, rendering the entire endeavor a failure.
277	15110	6	3	There are always challenges when you are trying something innovative, and the plan for a dirigible dock atop the Empire State Building was no exception. There are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support, and you also need to be structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of the architects faced all of these significant hurdles. During the 1920s dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel, and Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of his skyscraper. Other than getting people to go along with the plan he had other, more physical problems to solve. The wind is very violent at that altitude, posing a serious risk to any airship attempting to dock. Furthermore, dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city as it is dangerous, and some were highly flammable, creating a fire hazard. In conclusion, there were simply too many large obstacles to overcome for the idea to ever become a practical reality.
278	15111	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ranging from safety to legal issues. The primary danger was that ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles ran on hydrogen versus helium, and if one were to ever catch on fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger. Another critical problem was that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because the dirigible would be docked so high with little back control, the fierce winds would be a huge issue, a fact underscored by the observation that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Compounding these problems, if a dirigible were to dock there it would also be breaking laws, as ""...was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Ultimately, the builders faced a lot more obstacles dealing with the docking of dirigibles than just the architectural challenges alone."
279	15112	6	3	"The obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were considerable, starting with the need to build a higher, taller building to outperform rivals. They also had trouble with the construction timeline, so the workers had to push back the scheduled completion dates. Another significant obstacle that they had trouble with was the design and implementation of the mast itself. It is noted that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" highlighting the ultimate futility of the effort. The workers were also not planning on having this many obstacles; they just wanted to do the job efficiently. Despite their efforts, the combination of logistical and practical challenges ensured the dirigible dock would remain an unused feature."
280	15113	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were fundamental, with the primary concern being the structural integrity of the massive skyscraper. Their main challenge was trying to make sure the building didn't fall down, which required innovative engineering solutions for the time. This involved ensuring the foundation and steel frame could support the unprecedented height and the additional weight of features like the proposed dirigible mooring mast. Every aspect of the construction had to be meticulously planned and executed to guarantee stability and safety for the future occupants and the public below. This foundational concern for structural soundness was the critical obstacle that had to be overcome before any other ambitious features could even be considered.
281	15114	6	3	Some problems that the builders faced when building the mast on the top of the building was that they couldn't just drop the mast on top of the building's flat roof because then the wind would cause stress to the frame, as the blimps could be hanging there, pulling against their tether. The steel frame of the building would have to be extensively modified and significantly strengthened to properly support the mast and its loads. The considerable cost for these structural modifications were another significant problem for them two, adding a major financial burden to the ambitious project. These combined issues of engineering and expense presented a formidable challenge during the building's construction.
282	15115	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't simply put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof, which offered no inherent structural support for such a fixture. The mooring mast would put immense pressure on the building's frame from the weight and movement of a docked airship. To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame with additional steel supports. More than sixty thousand dollars' went into the modifications of the framework, a substantial investment. The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that. The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift, making a stable mooring nearly impossible. In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using lead weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around dangerously, ultimately dooming the concept of a skyscraper airship terminal.
283	15116	6	3	"In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the structure. One obstacle that constructors faced was structural modifications, as ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation."" With this obstacle contractors would need to reinforce the steelwork of the frame and the foundation to handle these new, dynamic forces. Another significant obstacle was the inherent danger of the airships themselves, as stated from the excerpt: ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable."" Given that hydrogen is highly flammable it would not be good if a dirigible exploded over the streets of New York, posing an unacceptable risk to public safety. Those are the key obstacles contractors faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's proposed dirigible dock."
284	15117	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The reason why the builders faced obstacles was because ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" without considering the immense structural implications. An example is ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the dirigible moor would make the buildings frame bend and become weak over time, threatening its integrity. That is just one obstacle that the builders faced, but there is many more, illustrating the complexity of this pioneering architectural endeavor."
285	15118	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles by building the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that Al Smith had competition with the Chrysler building, which was forty-six feet taller than the Empire State at the time. Which led to Smith making the State Building reach the new, unprecedented height of 1,250 feet to claim the title. This leads to another obstacle, as he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships, a novel idea for an urban skyscraper. This didn't work due to the lack of adequate landing space and the inherent dangers involved. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause tremendous stress to the buildings frame from wind and the airship's movement. In conclusion, I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building, which ranged from competitive height rivalry to the impracticalities of an aerial dock.
286	15119	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, the architects were faced with many obstacles when the decision was made to use the skyscraper to dock, load, and refuel dirigibles. How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of structural stress this would cause was an even bigger worry. But the greatest obstacle to this project was the wind, nature itself. The fear was that unpredictable gusts would blow the massive dirigible into a neighboring building, and securely tethering the airship was not considered a viable option for critical safety reasons. Due to the architect's ultimate inability to overcome these significant obstacles, the Empire State Building was never used for its original purpose.
287	15120	6	3	The first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. Because some airships were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four city blocks, finding an open space was nearly impossible. The second was that these dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen, a gas that was highly flammable. The planners realized how much worse an accident could have been if it had taken place in a dense urban center like New York because this is where they were located. They had to re-think about their plan. And another one was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable and safe docking procedure unfeasible. These combined factors ultimately prevented the plan from moving forward.
288	15121	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced challenging obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" This was a huge problem for the mooring masts because the airships could not get close enough to the building to land safely as the winds were too strong and unpredictable. Secondly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircrafts to be that low. Lastly, dirigibles from outside of the state used hydrogen rather than helium, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" After the German Hindenburg had an accident with fire it was clear that taking the risk of an accident like that happening above the heads of thousands of pedestrians was a bad idea. The obstacles, which were noticed too late before the construction, are why the dirigibles are not allowed to land on the Empire State Building to this day."
289	15122	6	3	"The obstacles that needed to be overcome to create the idea of a docking platform on top of what was going to be announced as ""The tallest building"" were going to be tough. The steps taken to make this idea come to life began with consulting with experts in the field. They took tours of the equipment and observed mooring operations at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey. When it was time to start constructing, the issue of the stress the building would intake from the mass of the dirigibles became a primary problem. They modified the building's frame to accommodate the new situation, reinforcing key structural points. They also designed a distinctive stainless steel tower with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were ultimately made to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast,"" though the mast itself would see little practical use."
290	15123	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a lot of dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen over helium. The problem was hydrogen is highly flammable; ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York City."" One can only imagine how tragic and chaotic that would have been. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. That would've meant that these dirigibles could just have got swept back,"" making a controlled approach impossible. In conclusion, there were several significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan."
291	15124	6	3	"In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These reasons are one that is due to flammable gases, a second is due to nature itself, and the last is an already existing law. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium."" @CAPS1 how flammable hydrogen is they didn't want that above a highly populated area, creating a significant safety hazard. Paragraph @NUM3 now states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" @CAPS2 the dirigible would not be stable enough to safely remain moored. Finally I said in paragraph @NUM4. ""There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS3 there was never a chance of a dirigible being able to dock there, as stated above, rendering the entire concept impractical from the start."
292	15125	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to be cautious about safety, which played a big role with the dirigibles. Many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable they wouldn't want the city to be destroyed and at risk of a massive fire from a potential accident. Another problem was nature itself. There were violent air currents above the building which made mooring a large airship incredibly difficult and would not be a danger to the local pedestrians of New York. The final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. They would be breaking the law to even allow it within the area of the building, and with so many issues occurring in the development of the dirigible plan, the idea of using them quietly disappeared.
293	15126	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was how to build the mooring mast and how to attach the mooring mast to the frame of the Empire @CAPS1 Building. The structural integration was a primary concern, as the immense forces exerted by a moored airship required a secure connection to the building's core support system. This engineering challenge was fundamental to the entire concept, and its difficulty was a significant hurdle from the outset.
294	15127	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible's to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allowed a dirigible to land for several hours. During the time of land the dirigible may get ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" Passengers could get off and on the dirigible safely by walking down a gangplank to the open platform. Architects had trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were afraid that the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted through the structure. Dirigibles had trouble with saftly, most of dirigibles use hydroge instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The greatest obstacle of mooring mast was nature itself, wind were high due to violent air currents, and it would not be safe for dirigibles to remain stationary. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allow to moor at @ORGANIZATION2 was law agaist airship flying too low over cities. The idea of dirigible was given away to airplanes as a more practical form of air travel. The obstacles the builders of @ORGANIZATION3 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was solved by abandoning the plan altogether."
295	15128	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the workers faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the architects say that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building."" The reason for this is because the top of the roof is held together by just one cable tether. The effect of landing something so heavy on the roof would add stress the the buildings frame, potentially compromising its integrity. In order to allow the dirigibles there they would need to strengthen and modifi the buildings framework, this would cost at least over @MONEY1, making it a very expensive undertaking. Rather than doing that the architects designed a glass, chrome and stainless steel tower that was @CAPS1 from inside, which served as a more elegant and structurally sound solution. This would ""rise a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" -paragraph @NUM2. Elevators would also be inside to help the passengers board the dirigibles, providing a means of access from the building's interior."
296	15129	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while building it, particularly concerning the planned dirigible dock. One obstacle they encountered was that the dirigibles couldn't dock there because of the initial absence of a proper mooring mast. When the architects and engineers first built the structure, they designed it with a flat roof, a configuration upon which the necessary Mooring Mast could not be effectively placed. To fix the situation, they stated that the entire steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be significantly modified and strengthened to bear the additional loads. Another critical obstacle was that they couldn't rely on a simple rope for holding the Mooring Mast up because the massive dirigibles would generate too much force for such a setup to be secure. These are some of the fundamental obstacles the architects went through in their ambitious plan.
297	15130	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were numerous and complex. The winds at that immense height were always changing, creating violent air currents that made it difficult and dangerous to land a large, slow-moving dirigible with any precision. Furthermore, the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable because they used volatile hydrogen rather than safer helium, posing a significant fire risk. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, which created an unstable and unpredictable environment for any docking attempt. The project was arguably a bad idea from the start, a fact underscored by another practical reason: an existing law against airships flying too low over densely populated urban areas. They even attempted a practical test before they ultimately gave up; in December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. The building simply wasn't made to do that job, so the concept ultimately would not work.
298	15131	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building by attempting to have dirigibles dock there were too many to accurately predict. The challenges for dirigibles docking at such a height were due to many variables such as the climate, the surrounding buildings, and most of all the dirigibles themselves. The climate, as noted, consisted of dangerous and uncontrollable winds, a problem exacerbated by the Empire State Building's own presence, which disrupted airflow. The urban areas around the skyscraper consisted of sharp, hull-breachingspires from other structures, and combined with the powerful winds, this made a catastrophic hull breach several times more likely. Finally, there was the fundamental issue of the dirigibles' own construction. Dirigibles were made with a lightweight steel frame wrapped in cotton fabric and filled with hydrogen to provide lift; unfortunately, the hydrogen was highly flammable, adding a severe safety hazard to the already daunting technical difficulties.
299	15132	6	3	In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many significant changes had to be made, and the builders and planners both faced many obstacles throughout the process. First of all, to even consider the ambitious idea, they had to consult with experts on airship handling, which meant taking tours of existing facilities and doing extensive research. They had to find a safe way of mooring airships to this mast that would account for the immense size and weight of the vessels. The next major obstacle was structural; docking a massive dirigible to the building would put tremendous stress on the building's steel frame. Consequently, the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to handle these new forces. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower itself. The builders eventually decided on a rocket-shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm and the necessary machinery to winch the dirigible into position. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes and spend a lot of money, all for a concept that ultimately proved to be unsafe and impractical in the end.
300	15133	6	3	"While constructing the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles related to the proposed dirigible mooring mast. According to the excerpt, the architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's existing roof; the structure required a dedicated design. Also, having a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would add too much stress on the frame of the building, creating a serious engineering challenge. In order to maintain the dirigible in place against powerful winds, it would cost them a significant amount of money for specialized equipment and structural reinforcements. Quoting the article, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened... sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" These combined technical and financial issues made it profoundly difficult for the architects to successfully build a functional and safe mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building."
301	15134	6	3	"The builders faced a few problems on letting it dock there. One problem was that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" said on page @NUM1. This created a significant fire risk, especially in a crowded urban environment. They were also so lead weights to lower the dirigibles down but this could also set risk for people said on page @NUM1, as the heavy weights would have to be dropped and carefully managed in a populated area. These combined dangers presented serious obstacles to the practical use of the mooring mast for dirigible operations."
302	15135	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had to accommodate a lot of things to allow dirigibles to dock at The mooring mast. For example in @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to modify and strengthen to accommodate this new situation"", indicating a need for major structural reinforcement. Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was natur itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", which made stable docking nearly impossible. These factors and many more where the reason the mooring mast was never put to use do to the fear of safety and law, rendering the ambitious feature ultimately impractical."
303	15136	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, their were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was the safety. Paragraph @NUM1 from the excerpts explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, then the accident could get ugly, leading to potential catastrophe. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, vulnerable to the unpredictable gusts. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which directly prohibited the planned operations. As you can see those were some significant obstacles builders faced in their ambitious plan."
304	15137	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. An obstacle dealt with if the dirigibles were fit to dock in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle dealt with the mast. These obstacles made this construction a failure such as the author who says, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" in @CAPS1 thirteen. First of, @CAPS1 five states the dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make some lighter in the air."" @CAPS1 six states that, ""Some were as long as one thousand feet."" @CAPS2 how may a blimp of that size ever managed to land on the Empire State Building, highlighting the sheer impracticality of the scale. Also @CAPS1 nine says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This @CAPS1 also states that ""The stress the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" These were just a few of the obstacles the builders had to face. The fate of the mast such as in @CAPS1 @NUM1 says ""was neither practical nor safe."" The architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. In the end the mast was a great attempt, but indeed a failure, a visionary idea undone by physical and practical realities."
305	15138	6	3	"The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem was the harsh wind that high up made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigible, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers"", making precise navigation a constant struggle. Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to safety hazards with people getting off of it, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off, creating an unstable platform for passengers. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft so low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not thought out well and was hurried so it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast, a race for a title that overlooked fundamental flaws."
306	15139	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to build the Empire State Building for use of dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the architects and engineers faced was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" this was very dangerous because hydrogen is highly flammable and posed a significant fire risk. Another obstacle that was faced was that ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" even though the dirigible would be tied down to the mooring mast ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" making a secure connection nearly impossible. Another problem due to the winds would be that ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" causing catastrophic damage. A last example of an obstacle would be that there is a law stating that all ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" was illegal. Even if there wasn't a law making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" the attemption of even trying would be very dangerous to the people around and below it, and the building itself, ultimately rendering the concept unworkable."
307	15140	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the safety of the people below. The primary concern was the immense risk to the public in such a densely populated urban area. Also As it says in the text ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This legal restriction presented a major barrier to the plan's implementation. Another main reason is in the text regarding the wind currents, which were violently shifting. These unpredictable gusts at such a high altitude made the delicate process of docking a massive airship incredibly hazardous and difficult to control, contributing to the plan's failure."
308	15141	6	3	The obstacles the Empire State Building faced were the balloons being made out of flammable material, and the wind blowing the dirigible around. The use of hydrogen gas in many foreign dirigibles was a critical safety issue due to its highly combustible nature. Furthermore, the powerful and shifting winds at the skyscraper's summit posed a severe challenge to stability. Even when moored, the airship would be swung violently by the air currents, making a safe and stable docking procedure impossible to achieve. These combined factors of dangerous materials and uncontrollable weather conditions created insurmountable problems for the ambitious docking scheme.
309	15142	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as described in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building were all very competitive for the Building to be very tall and they did not have a very great plan that they used. They wanted the building to have a great top and wanted it to also be useful, so they wanted dirigibles to dock there. They figured out after that it wasn't such a good idea when they looked into the history of how many accidents happened. If any accident happened in New York like that then it would be a very big deal because there are so many people that live there. The specific problem of wind was a major issue; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, demonstrating a clear lack of control. They felt it would be unsafe for many reasons, including this significant aerodynamic challenge. This is the reason why the builders went through many obstacles that ultimately proved too great to overcome."
310	15143	6	3	According to the text both the engineers and the architects came across several obstacles when it came to building an area where blimps could land that made this plan unfeasible. One of the primary reasons that this concept failed was due to the air laws that made it illegal to fly too low in urban areas, creating an immediate legal blockade. An additional conflict was the fact that the strong winds could push the tail of the blimp into sharp spires of neighboring buildings that would pop the dirigible as if it were a balloon. This risk of structural puncture from nearby architecture presented a clear and present danger to any airship attempting to approach the mast. Together, these legal and physical dangers made the entire venture impractical from the start.
311	15144	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast I have seen how the builders of the Empire State building ran into obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State building was already standing when the architects decided to renovate and make a dock for dirigibles. The architects working on this project had to strengthen the building's frame to handle the immense stress of a moored airship. They also had to have winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring to manage the docking process. The architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the base floor and back up, creating a vertical terminal. After the renovations were done to the Empire State building it had 102 floors, crowned with the new mast. After the building was done the owners found out that they could not let dirigibles on to the building. They would break the law of airships flying too low in urban areas, which posed a legal barrier. So the Empire State building was finished but you could not use it for dirigibles, rendering the ambitious mooring mast ultimately impractical.
312	15145	6	3	Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach the new height of 1,250 ft on December 11, 1929. His plan was to build a mooring mast, at the top of the building to make it equipped for modern travel. The builders faced three main obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. When the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building became worried that a much worse accident would occur in the densely populated heart of New York. The second and greatest obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building constantly shifted, which would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The only way to solve this problem was with lead weights, but this was not practical or safe for a routine operation. The final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the building, creating an insurmountable legal hurdle. In conclusion, the three main obstacles that the builders faced were safety, nature, and the law, which together prevented the mast from ever being used as intended.
313	15146	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that there wasn't a lot of room for them to land. The length of them was the same as four blocks in New York City, making maneuvering in the confined urban space extremely difficult. They also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment to understand the complexities of airship handling. They did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles to assess the feasibility of the project. It was also dangerous to have them land there due to the inherent risks involved. It was also bad for the environment because hydrogen is used and it is highly flammable, raising significant safety concerns. Dirigibles can't dock there because it wasn't stable and that makes it not safe for people, leading to the conclusion that the site was fundamentally unsuitable for such operations.
314	15147	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solved this problem by modifying the building's framework to bear the additional load. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Even if there was one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed, as no safe method of stabilization could be devised. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast as a functional airship terminal."
315	15148	6	3	Al Smith had a great idea when he thought he was going to have a dirigible station dock on top of the world's tallest building. He had great creativity and wanted to use his building to its full potential, envisioning it as a gateway for aerial travel. Although there were many problems to this idea. One was the urban area below, as many people lived in downtown New York City and it would be against the law to have zeppelins flying above the populated area, creating a clear legal impediment. Another important problem was the intense winds that were harsh and made it very hard to dock on the building, threatening the stability of any airship attempting to moor. There were many obstacles in the way of fulfilling Al Smith's dream for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on the top of the building, and these challenges ultimately proved too great to overcome.
316	15149	6	3	"Some of the things they faced were significant safety hazards. Like when they said in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the Hindenburg was destroyed, they said ""The owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it was over new york."" This highlighted the extreme danger of using flammable hydrogen gas in a densely populated urban area. Another obstacle they faced, as they said in @CAPS1 @NUM2, was ""Nature itself."" The powerful and unpredictable winds would make a massive airship @CAPS3 around like crazy, making a stable docking procedure nearly impossible. The last problem was the existing law stating airships can @CAPS3 that low above urban cities, which presented a legal barrier that had been overlooked in the initial planning. These combined factors ultimately prevented the mooring mast from ever being used as intended."
317	15150	6	3	"In the @DATE1's dirigibles were considered the transportation of the future. Trying to make New York the forefront of modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State building rushed to the challenge of building a mooring mast failling to recognize the obstacles that lay ahead. As the architects designed the mast they quickly realized the frame of the building was not equipped to handle the weight on top of its flat roof, requiring significant and costly structural reinforcements. Making those adjustments had cost builders more time and New York City more money. In addition workers had not considered wind currents, a critical oversight for a structure intended for airships. In this excerpt the writer says ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This real-world test proved the concept was flawed. @CAPS1 workers should have considered these possible obstacles before building something as big a project as a mooring mast, as the venture proved to be impractical and ultimately useless."
318	15151	6	3	"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city like New York. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in such harsh and unpredictable weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building, creating a legal impossibility. In conclusion, the three main @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws, which together made the project unfeasible."
319	15152	6	3	"In this project to construct a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were some fundamental problems. The idea of the mooring mast was to be able to dock dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building + be able to have passengers get on + off the dirigible from + into the building. The big problem that it faced was the intense wind speeds that high up in the air. At nearly @NUM1 feet in the air the wind would be whiping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible, making any passenger transfer perilous. When New York governor, Al Smith put forth ideas to construct this mast nobody realized untill after that it was a somewhat rediculous task, driven more by ambition than practicality. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be down to reality, and the mast became a monument to a failed vision."
320	15153	6	3	In the excerpt, it talks about making the empire state building the tallest in new york. It was the tallest building until archetectures built the chrysler building. The chrysler building stood 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the empire state building. So Al Smith realized he was gonna loose his tittle for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building in the form of a mooring mast. The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps and withstand the forces involved. He also had to think about how passangers would get on and off the blimp safely from such a great height. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of hellium which hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a great risk. For example the German blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lake hurst, a disaster that underscored the inherent dangers of his plan. Ultimately, these practical challenges proved too great for the ambitious idea to overcome.
321	15154	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was strengthening the building's frame. This was necessary because the added pressure of the dirigible's load and the considerable wind force needed to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. The existing skeleton of the building had to be edited and significantly reinforced. In fact, these structural edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a unique look, architects made the tower out of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the heavy machinery at the base of this tower to maintain stability. The builders also had to make sure it was accessible to passengers; they made sure luggage and people could go to and from the aircraft via a specially designed gangplank. These are two of the primary challenges builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building. Despite the mast being unused in the present day, the ambitious design makes this building one of the most well-known buildings in the world.
322	15155	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the harsh winds. The Empire State Building is so tall that the winds were very fast and it would constantly change direction due to violent air currents, creating unpredictable and hazardous conditions. This made it very hard to dock the dirigibles securely. Also another obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around. Most ballons were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk. If a dirigible got caught on fire or crashed, a lot of damage would be done to the city and its people below. The structure of the building also proved to be an obstacle. The dirigibles were so large that the buildings structure was at danger of failing from the added stress and destroying the building. The final obstacle the building faced was the law that made it illegal for a ship to ever tie to a building or even fly that low in an urban area, creating a legal barrier. Although there were a few attempts, the Empire State Building never was able to have dirigibles to dock on it successfully.
323	15156	6	3	"In the excerpt, there where many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The problems where that the dirigible being ""held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"", and the wind pressure wouldn't help either, as stated in the text, combining to create a serious structural challenge. Another issue was that, as said in the source, ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium"",... ""hydrogen is highly flammable"", creating a major safety concern. Also in the text, ""The owners of the empire state building realized how much worse,"" a accident could be ""if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York, potentially causing catastrophic loss of life. These are the significant problems the builders faced in their ambitious plan."
324	15157	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their ideas. The builders thought they would be able to make a successful landing dock for dirigibles. Everything they did was all planned right but when it came time to test it, it didn't work as intended. There were quit a few problems with there idea of using the Empire State Building is a landing dock for dirigibles.One reason that this one not successful was because the dirigibles wern't able to get close enough to attach the building In order for the dirigible to be ankered would be for a rope to be tied to some thing. But the balloons wern't able to get to close to the building because the point at the top of the building was making it too hard. If it got to close to the point, it could puncture the balloon which would not be could because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall catastrophically. There is one more major reason they're plan did not work.The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would get so wild the back of the blimp would sway back and forth, making it dangerous for passengers attempting to disembark. They wouldn't be able to weigh it down with weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down in the city, creating an untenable risk. These were the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the empire state building would not work.
325	15158	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City, which offered very little open space. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's frame, which is dangerous and required complex engineering solutions. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking, making a secure docking procedure nearly impossible. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling precariously above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders had to confront many different obstacles that ultimately proved too great to overcome.
326	15159	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too, creating a catastrophic event in the heart of the city. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable, making a secure docking procedure nearly impossible. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed by the heavy, falling object. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, directly prohibiting the proposed docking maneuver. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made, ultimately proving the concept to be unfeasible."
327	15160	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, posing a significant structural risk. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications on the framework were required to even attempt to handle such forces. The greatest obstace of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current, creating an unpredictable and hazardous environment. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it impossible to maintain a stable and safe connection. These combined issues of structural integrity and natural forces presented insurmountable challenges to the docking plan.
328	15161	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting dirigibles to dock there. First the stress of ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" was a problem for the structural integrity of the skyscraper. So the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles, which was a costly and complex engineering task. Next, they faced the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents, which would violently toss any docked airship. If you had a dirigible moored and weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians, it could lead to disaster if those weights were to fall. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders realized too many obstacles interfered and it could never happen safely or practically."
329	15162	6	3	"In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast"", the author @ORGANIZATION2 explains some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in their attemp of allowing dirigibles dock on the mast of the Empire State Building.First of all, the dirigibles were big and heavy and needed space to land. @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""some were... the same length as four blocks in New York City."" If the builders wanted to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the building, they would need a lot of space to build a big landing platform for a safe landing, which the building's pinnacle could not provide. Secondly, the decided that they could not land dirigibles on a flat roof and decided to tie it with a cable tether. The authors says ""the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the... flat roof."" They realized that the weight of the dirigible would deform the buildings structure and that the strong winds could cause damages down to the foundation of the building, threatening its stability. In conclusion, the workers faced many obstacles in order for them to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the State holding, and these challenges proved too great to overcome."
330	15163	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, while trying to build a dock for dirigible. One problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, other countries filled their dirigibles with highly flamable hydrogen. If a dirigible were to ignite in a heavily populated area like New York City, the result would be deadly, risking countless lives and property. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and ever-changing, and could potentially destroy the dirigibles or slam them against the structure. Finally, federal laws stated that an air craft could not dock that close to a building, creating a legal barrier that could not be ignored. These three factors made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, sealing the fate of the ambitious proposal.
331	15164	6	3	Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with dirigibles dock there were many complications. At the outset, the building was unable to simply put a mooring mast on top of the building. The roof was flat, therefore the dirigible would add significant stress to the building's structure. They would need over a million dollars to modify the building framework, a cost that was deemed prohibitive. Then they realized that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable which would be unsafe for a structure in a dense urban area. They ran into a problem with nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds constantly shifted because of the violent air currents. Even if they were to tether the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast, making a stable connection impossible. Therefore with people all over the streets in Manhattan this was neither possibly or safe. There was also an exisisting law against flying airships too low over urban areas, which presented a final legal barrier. All this gave way to airplanes, so even though dirigibles didn't work it helped advance other forms of air travel.
332	15165	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was the safer alternative. Hydrogen is highly flamable, and if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous, a fear tragically confirmed by the Hindenburg disaster. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght, the powerful and unpredictable winds would blow the back of the dirigible around in a dangerous arc. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities, making the entire concept illegal from the start. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible to realize safely.
333	15166	6	3	"Back in the roaring twenties and thirties, New York City was a popular place which needed to adapt to the ways of modernizing travel. A new and fashionable form of travel was the blimp, or the dirigible. These giant balloons had nowhere to dock in the city, and solving that solution was harder than expected. Al Smith, architect of the Empire State Building decided that he could use the top of the tower as a mooring mast for these dirigibles. After adapting the entire building for the change, Smith ran into a few problems. The first major issue surfaced when a German dirigible exploded in New Jersey. This let Smith know that it would be a bad idea to allow any foreign blimps near as most non-American crafts were filled with ""hydrogen [which] is highly flammable,"" leaving possibility for catastrophe. Another snag was the ""winds on top of the building... shifting due to... air currents"" which would cause the dirigibles to freely and dangerously sway in the wind. With the wind, they could crash into towers and ""would be dangling above pedestrians."" Legal valves also came into play as there was a preexisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make any dirigible activity with the Empire State Building downright illegal. These combined issues ultimately prevented the plan from ever becoming a reality."
334	15167	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top building. The stress and preasure of a thousand foot dirigible docked at the top of the building was too great for the buildings original frame work to support, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so the preasure would be transmitted to the buildings foundation, a costly and complex engineering challenge. Another obstacle was most dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was much more flamible and the hydrogen dirigibles like the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in fire and they didn't want that to happen over New york's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast the back would swivel around the mooring mast, creating an unstable and hazardous situation. The many unseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it in unpracticle docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s after airplanes, and dirigibles had disappeared the ticketing & bagging rooms were turned into tourist and site seers areas, finding a new purpose for the ambitious but failed project."
335	15168	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many obstacles. One of these obstacles being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" Furthermore, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame. Such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" These significant obstacles plagued the construction of the docks and ultimately led to the concept's abandonment."
336	15169	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the downfall of this creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1). The world saw the dangerous effects of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was tragically destroyed in a fire. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1). Other significant problems were those posed by mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1). This unpredictable weather made it exceptionally hard for a dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). Not only was nature working against the builders, but legal issues also presented a major hurdle, an oversight that bordered on negligence. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1). Although the idea for a dirigible mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building seemed innovative and practical, it was ultimately rendered irrelevant due to the many insurmountable obstacles that obstructed its realization."
337	15170	6	3	"By attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building, builders encountered all sorts of problems with the ambitious plan to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. Many of these problems, however, were directly related to the inherent nature of the dirigible itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, the author talks about some of the primary dangers, stating, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another critical obstacle was the building's location in the heart of the city. It was thought to be profoundly unsafe because if a blimp caught fire, it would crash in the middle of New York City, not some remote cornfield, endangering thousands of lives. And finally, the winds changed frequently that high up, creating a volatile and unstable environment for docking. It was an unwise decision to attempt docking in this area if the dirigible would simply be blown around the building, posing a constant risk."
338	15171	6	3	Al Smith was a determined individual who had the idea of making the world's tallest building, and he didn't give up on this vision. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building's goal height would reach 1,250 feet. He also wanted the building's purpose to involve advanced transportation. The primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the fundamental lack of a safe landing area. Al Smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. One of the greatest obstacles to letting the dirigibles dock was the weather, as the airships were at the mercy of high-altitude winds. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down, but here it could dangle high above pedestrians on the street, creating a public hazard. It was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier that ultimately contributed to the concept's failure.
339	15172	6	3	"Throughout life, many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to accomplish amazing feats in order to do this, often facing unforeseen challenges. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, @ORGANIZATION1 plans on building the tallest building in the world, but in order to do this he has to defeat many obstacles that you and I may never even think of. On December 11, 1929, the Empire State Building was announced as the world's tallest building. In making this huge structure, there were many obstacles, one of which was the plan for allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the powerful and unpredictable winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle is, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, adding a legal complication to the physical challenges. In life we defeat great obstacles but sometimes we cannot defeat the obstacles we face, as was the case with this innovative but impractical docking idea."
340	15173	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes the various obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 they described the greatest reason was one of safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a grave risk of fire. In paragraph @NUM2 they also describe another obstacle was nature itself because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast, making a secure connection nearly impossible. Even dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, and this procedure would be dangerous for pedestrians on city streets. In paragraph @NUM3 they describe another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, creating a final, legal barrier. These are the key examples of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
341	15174	6	3	The Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles severely affected the building's attempt to create a functional dirigible dock. For instance, the Empire State Building is located in a very dense urban location, which presented inherent dangers. At the time, most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium. The main difference between the two gases was that Hydrogen is more flammable than Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignite, a catastrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devastating as the Hindenburg disaster, which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architects and engineers to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible off course then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown off course while docking, the pedestrians on the ground level could be seriously injured, ultimately rendering the concept impractical.
342	15175	6	3	"Dirigibles, or blimps, were seen as the transportation of the future. In order to add height and yet serve a purpose, architects of the Empire State Building decided to build a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" Although the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, the usage of it as a docking station for dirigibles would never be fulfilled. The obstacles that builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, thus having violent shifts in air currents. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles also used hydrogen for lift and lead weights to be weighed down; however, by using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights provided a significant safety hazard to civilians below. The volatile gas and heavy ballast created an unacceptable risk for a densely populated area. Builders had created the mooring mast to dock dirigibles, but the idea caused insurmountable problems and was never fulfilled as a practical venture."
343	15176	6	3	There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether would add significant stress to the building's frame. This stress would cause the building's foundation to crack. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, a modification that cost them over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was done, they then had to complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself; the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but this method could not be safely used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the idea of dirigibles and the mooring mast disappearing entirely.
344	15177	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building's attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was a futile effort. They tried a numerous amount of different ways to approach this idea. There were a few different theories on what would be best, and how to develop the Mooring Mast, as proposed by Al Smith and John Tauranac. Each man had a different thought on how the whole structure would turn out. The architects designed a new glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that ranged from the bottom to the top of the Empire State Building. This structure helped support the mooring area, where the dirigibles were supposed to be docked. But the fate of the Mast was not too bright. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State building was Never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This statement is utterly true and shows the work of the architects was never fully planned and was overlooked, particularly regarding the Mast's durability and practical function in a real-world setting."
345	15178	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the followings. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area within the dense urban environment. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigible couldn't do anything even if tethered to the mooring mast, as the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making a stable and safe docking procedure impossible to achieve. These fundamental issues of location and unpredictable weather conditions proved to be decisive factors in the failure of the ambitious docking scheme.
346	15179	6	3	The installation of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would have made the building, as well as the city of New York, incredibly important to modern travel in the 1930s. Alas, many difficult obstacles made the mast impossible to complete. First, to get the mast to the top, the building's frame had to be strengthened and reinforced, which was painstaking and expensive, requiring significant modifications to the structure. Second, the builders had to deal with the possibility of the blimps exploding due to their highly flammable hydrogen gas. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. With constantly shifting, violent winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin would sway and swivel around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers. With high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and fall onto the city below, potentially killing hundreds. Lastly, the builders failed to take into account the law that forbade dirigibles to fly too close to urban areas. This law made it illegal for any blimp to get near the Empire State Building, let alone dock on it. The thought of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit one destined to fail from the beginning due to these insurmountable challenges.
347	15180	6	3	"The Mooring Mast is mainly about builders and architects attempting to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building in New York. At first, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring on passengers, creating a new form of urban air travel. The mooring mast was needed because ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" One reason why this plan did not work out was because it was not safe, because the hydrogen that dirigibles use is highly flammable and this could cause a serious fire, endangering the entire city. Also, if it was a windy day, the dirigibles could get pushed around by the winds. To stop this, they have lead weights to weight them down, but they cannot use these with all of the people and other buildings around, as it would be too hazardous. Also, dirigibles could not fly too low over these kinds of areas due to existing aviation regulations. Although the plan did not work, it was better to have everyone be safe than to proceed with such a risky venture."
348	15181	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, both during construction and after. During the creation of the mooring mast, the architects had to figure out how to place it on top of the building, because the stress of the load and wind pressure would add stress to the building's frame; instead, they had to transmit the load and pressure to the foundation, modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building extensively. Builders also wanted the mast to be aesthetically pleasing, needing to make the tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, rising to a conical roof and illuminated from inside to serve as a beacon. After the creation of the mooring mast, more difficulties arose. The safety of the mast was an issue, as the hydrogen-using blimps outside the U.S. were highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire as a result, highlighting the catastrophic risk. The winds at the top of the building, too, created danger, for they constantly shifted from the violent air currents. Dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Another obstacle was the law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would be illegal, therefore, for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even fly too close to the area, rendering the entire concept impractical from a legal standpoint.
349	15182	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" it revealed many problems with docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the former governor promoting the building, thought the mooring mast would go up with no problems and be a great success. Architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add significant stress to the building's frame work and cost a great deal of money in modifications to reinforce the structure. After seeing what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with highly-flammable hydrogen over the densely populated New York City wasn't a good idea due to the immense fire hazard. Nature itself would not allow the mooring mast to be built. There was such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty foot tall altitude that made architects aware that this idea couldn't be upheld. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down like in open landing fields. They couldn't use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians heads was neither practical nor safe. There is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to try and dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. In the end, the idea of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building and become the new way of modern transportation was soon abolished, proving to be an unworkable concept."
350	15183	6	3	While attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. For one thing, there wasn't a whole lot of landing room in New York City for them which ultimately made things tougher and highlighted the urban constraints. Also, they were forced to put more work into the building by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of it to accommodate the new situation and the additional stresses. A lot of money was spent on these new renovations, over sixty thousand dollars, which was a substantial sum at the time. This was done mainly to reduce stress on the building's frame and ensure its structural integrity could handle the forces of a moored airship. But overall they managed to get the mast built, and make their way through these tricky obstacles, even though it would ultimately never be used for its intended purpose.
351	15184	6	3	Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building on top of New York. He envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. Technical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. First, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure their landings, but this would be impractical and dangerous when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be ever more problematic in the city, as if a dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city. Neither of the dirigibles that tried to moor could because of the powerful wind and the proximity of other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of Manhattan would have been, the fundamental safety problems could not be fixed and there were simply too many people around to risk it.
352	15185	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were significant when they were planning to build a mast for the dirigibles. When they first tried to design it, they figured out that the structure of the Empire State Building could not adequately hold the mast and the immense forces involved. The Empire State Building had to support both the weight of the massive mast itself and the powerful pull of the dirigibles moored to it in high winds. Then, at the end of the story, they figured out there was no structurally sound way to do it safely. That was one of the primary obstacles that ultimately led to the concept's failure.
353	15186	6	3	"Whenever architectural work is put in act, thoughts of the potential consequences should be thought out beforehand. In ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The blimps consist of dangerous chemicals and, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A possibility of flames could result in a ruined building, and even worse, a destroyed city. Although fires were a problem to consider, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This building is extremely high in the sky, therefore the winds get quite brutal. If a blimp was tied to the mast, the tail of the ship would continuously swivel and ruin the fabric of the aircraft, posing a constant threat. A mooring mast was just not a bright idea for a large city like New York. The population was too large, and the area was too crowded for such a risky venture. The obstacles the architects faced were serious, and they ultimately helped the team to kill the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
354	15187	6	3	"Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by the Smithsonian Institution. These obstacles included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe between the explosive tendencies of Hydrogen and the unmanageable winds. With the winds the dirigible would continuously move around the mast, creating an extremely unsafe environment for all involved. Availability would also be put into question; in paragraph fifteen the Smithsonian Institution tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempting to dock due to the unavailable route of safe entrance. This unavailability of a clear and safe flight path made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible. The obstacles in the mooring mast, therefore, conclusively included both availability and safety."
355	15188	6	3	There are many obstacles with the docking of the dirigibles; for example, in the text it talked about how if an accident had taken place over New York City it would have been a lot worse because New York is a densely populated city. Another obstacle was the extreme height, as mentioned in the text, and anything could happen at that height, including sudden wind gusts that could throw a dirigible off course. The combination of a populated area below and the treacherous conditions at such a high altitude created significant dangers. So those are some of the critical obstacles in the way of the successful docking of the dirigibles.
356	15189	6	3	"In the article, The Mooring Mast by the architectural team was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest building. To make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Smith decided to create a ""mooring mast"" where dirigibles could land and become ""transportation of the future."" However, the dirigibles never landed, because there were many obstacles in landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Many Dirigibles that are from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and because the Empire State Building is in New York City, it would be hazardous for a hydrogen filled dirigible to land, in a densely populated area, like New York City, where a fire could cause catastrophic damage. Another obstacle faced is the weather at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds are much stronger than down the streets, creating powerful gusts and unpredictable air currents. If the dirigible were able to land, the winds would be blowing the dirigible all around and out of control, making a stable connection to the mast nearly impossible. Finally, it is illegal to have airships flying too low to the ground and near people. By having a dirigible land on the mast, it would break the law, as such maneuvers were prohibited over urban centers. There were too many obstacles for Al Smith's idea to become reality, and the mast remained an unused architectural feature."
357	15190	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles. They would not be able to simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unsturdy. With the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it would have to get transmitted to eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is, placing immense structural strain on the entire building. The builders would need to make the frame stronger to withstand the stress which would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant additional expense. In the end the mooring mast never was made because of safety concerns, the unpredictable nature of the weather, and of the law itself. It was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger. The winds would shift too constantly and violently and be too very difficult to control the dirigible during any attempted docking procedure. Also, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area legally. Overall, there were too many obstacles that made it impossible for the engineers to build a functional and safe mooring mast.
358	15191	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a densely populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city, posing a direct threat to people and property below. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast a reality, including the necessary structural reinforcements and safety systems. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building, with updrafts and turbulence creating highly hazardous conditions. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed and used as intended.
359	15192	6	3	The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized only after the structure was complete. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people living and working directly below. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds around the skyscraper's peak. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe for the crew, the passengers, or the building itself. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the concept's abandonment.
360	15193	6	3	"There are several things that are worrisome about dirigibles docking there. One of them was the fact that ""The dirigibles would sway in the wind As the passengers walked down A Gangplank"". This would be unsafe because As it sways, it could knock the passengers off the plank and cause them to fall from a great height. The gangplank itself would be narrow and exposed, offering no handholds or safety nets to prevent a tragic accident. Even a slight shift in the airship's position could create a dangerous gap or a sudden tilt, making the simple act of disembarking a perilous undertaking. The inherent instability of a massive, buoyant aircraft tethered high above the city presented a risk that was simply too great to ignore."
361	15194	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating an unstable environment for docking. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the powerful gusts would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the fixed point. Compounding this danger was the choice of lifting gas; many dirigibles, particularly those from outside the United States, used hydrogen rather than the safer alternative of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, presenting a severe fire risk. These combined natural and technical challenges proved insurmountable for the building's intended role as an airship terminal.
362	15195	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were rooted in the practical limitations of urban air travel. A primary challenge for their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area within the densely built environment. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building to provide a solution. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would theoretically allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. The proposed method involved dirigibles being docked by means of an electric winch, which would haul in a line from the front of the ship and then tie it securely to the mast. However, this innovative concept ultimately proved impractical due to the hazardous conditions at such a height.
363	15196	6	3	"The main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building's mooring mast was safety. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This inherent danger was a critical concern, as ""the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above downtown New York."" If an accident were to happen with a dirigible moored to the skyscraper, it would be putting hundreds of people's lives at risk both on the airship and on the streets below. That is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe. Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building's mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This unpredictable weather would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. While lead weights could be used to stabilize a dirigible, that was neither practical nor safe where they would be dangling high above pedestrians. These fundamental issues of safety and stability prevented the plan from becoming a viable reality."
364	15197	6	3	"In the excerpt, *The Mooring Mast*, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are outlined. One obstacle was that many dirigibles, particularly those from outside of the United States, used hydrogen rather than helium. This was a significant problem because, as stated, ""hydrogen is highly flammable,"" creating a substantial fire hazard in an urban setting. The greatest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was nature itself. Nature would be an obstacle because ""dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The combination of volatile weather and the inherent dangers of the required stabilization methods were some of the key obstacles the builders faced."
365	15198	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles trying to attempt dirigibles to be allowed to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders faced obstacles like the lack of available land area in New York for a traditional airfield. It is noted that a big problem they faced was that the airships could not just land right on the flat roof. Some other problems they faced were structural; the cable and winch system at the top of the building added significant stress to the building structure eleven hundred feet below, and some of this specialized work cost over sixty thousand dollars. Further problems with safety involved the proposed use of lead weights, which would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. And another unsafe factor was that the hydrogen in these dirigibles was highly flammable, which is very unsafe. Furthermore, an existing law against flying airships above urban areas presented a legal obstacle. These multifaceted challenges ultimately rendered the ambitious docking plan unfeasible.
366	15199	6	3	"The Empire State Building was an incredible building even without the idea of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. But with this idea of the mooring mast, it brought up many obstacles, primarily concerning the safety of the public. L¸sted states ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This statement proves that if a dirigible were to catch fire, as in the tragic accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then the citizens of New York's lives would be at stake. This safety hazard was one of the builder's most significant problems. These architects faced many challenges with this mooring mast idea, including the dangerous factor of nature. L¸sted states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is extremely dangerous because a dirigible could start to move around the building while docked, causing hazardous maneuvers and putting pedestrian's lives at risk. For this mooring idea, the combination of flammable gases and unpredictable weather made it too dangerous for the public and the city of New York, ultimately dooming the concept to failure."
367	15200	6	3	In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, the builders faced some significant obstacles. The first obstacle builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. If there wasn't sufficient area to land, there was no reason or practical way to build the mast. Also, the builders would have had to remodel the whole building to accommodate this feature. After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so the construction took even longer, adding to the complexity. The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no safe way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building. As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful in practice. It was a great idea in theory, but in my opinion it was a waste of time and money given the insurmountable challenges involved.
368	15201	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were substantial. One major problem was that it was very windy at the top of the skyscraper, so it was extremely hard for the large, buoyant dirigibles to hook up to the docking gear safely. Another critical obstacle was that the dirigibles were very flammable, so they presented a grave danger to the entire city if they were to catch on fire while attempting to dock. One other reason the plan failed was that a law existed which made it illegal for an airship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the entire concept legally unworkable. These combined issues of dangerous weather conditions, inherent fire risk, and legal restrictions proved that the ambitious plan was not feasible for the safety and security of New York City.
369	15202	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several key obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was public safety because outside the U.S., dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable and posed a significant fire hazard. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast, however, was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, making a stable and safe docking procedure nearly impossible. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law explicitly stated it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building, creating a legal barrier that could not be overcome. Together, these challenges of safety, nature, and law ensured that the visionary mooring mast would never serve its intended purpose.
370	15203	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, they risked having dirigibles from places outside the U.S. cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they would run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they were potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second, another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempted to tie down the dirigibles there was a chance that the craft would move around. Given the idea that the winds would be too much to handle, they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but such measures would become a hazard for pedestrians below. Finally, there was a law that prevented any airships from flying too low. The article reads ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). The law made it extremely hard for the builders to proceed. The overall idea was to make the airship land on the building, and this legal obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, as it was too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless, the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", effectively describes the multitude of challenges put upon builders who sought to build a dock for dirigibles."
371	15204	6	3	The obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the empire state building was, they couldn't put the fuell on top of the building. This was a significant issue because the necessary fuel for the airships was too hazardous to store at such a great height. Putting mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and putt a lot of Pressure on it. The immense weight and the dynamic forces exerted by a docked airship posed a serious risk to the building's structural integrity. For this to happen they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over @MONEY1. After succefully building that they had another obstacle. It was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents. The violent and unpredictable air currents at that altitude made it impossible to secure the massive vessels safely. They never figured out how and the idea just disappeared, ultimately rendering the ambitious docking project unfeasible.
372	15205	6	3	"From the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attenting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the designing as well as the cost of this project could encounter problems. Such as, ""add stress to the building's frame."" The structural modifications required to support the mast and the forces of a moored dirigible were a primary concern. If the mass interfered with the frame of the building, then changing the material of the building could cost ""over sixty thousand dollars!"" In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential for a catastrophic fire in a densely populated area like New York was an enormous risk. New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered into perspective. Lastly, their were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As it states in the excerpt, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This legal barrier presented a fundamental challenge to the entire concept. Overall, when constructing the mooring mast, many builders were blind to the potential problems, making the project unsuccessful from its inception."
373	15206	6	3	One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting, creating an unstable and dangerous environment for any large, lighter-than-air vessel. The dirigible would constantly be moving around, making a secure and stable docking procedure impossible to achieve. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall, posing an unacceptable public safety hazard. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city, which were designed to protect the populace and property on the ground. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles, proving the concept to be impractical.
374	15207	6	3	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the strong wind currents, the fact that dirigibles were very flammable, and that they were very large and hard to keep still. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that the use of hydrogen rather than helium should have stopped the project due to the extreme flammability of hydrogen gas, which was a common lifting agent. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it states that the biggest obstacle was nature itself, referring to the powerful and unpredictable wind shears encountered at the building's summit. The sheer size of the airships meant that even when tethered, their vast surface area acted like a sail in the wind. For the reasons above those are some of the obstacles builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there, highlighting the project's inherent difficulties."
375	15208	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle builders faced was the building's @CAPS1. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the [Empire State Building] held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame."" This structural stress was a critical engineering challenge that required costly reinforcements. Another obstacle in the way was nature itself. The reason was that the winds on top of the Empire State Building was always changing because of violent air currents. This was dangerous because ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating an uncontrollable and hazardous situation. @CAPS2, there is a law in the United States against airships Flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the [Empire State Building] or even approach the area, presenting a legal blockade. Many more obstacles were faced during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State @CAPS3, but that didn't stop the workers from completing the mast's construction despite its eventual impracticality."
376	15209	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the dirigible's back to swivel around the mooring mast and making a stable connection nearly impossible. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was tragically demonstrated by the Hindenburg, which blew up; if a blimp blew up over downtown New York, tons of lives would be lost, presenting a huge risk to the mooring mast. ""Was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would prevent dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast legally, rendering the concept impractical from a regulatory standpoint. All of those obstacles contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show and contributing to the world's tallest building, a symbol of ambition that far outpaced its practical utility."
377	15210	6	3	In the excerpt the builders were faced with multiple issues on their theory. It took lots of time for people to begin realizing the reality of the situation. For example, airships had a law preventing them from getting too low to urban areas, which presented a legal barrier. Also they realized major weather conditions would play a negative role. Wind would cause the dirigible to swing around while docked, creating instability. They thought to weigh down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that is unsafe over many people below due to the risk of dropping ballast. They had heard of a dirigible in New Jersey that was destroyed by fire, due to its hydrogen, which was also unsafe in New York with such a dense population. Overall they began to realize the numerous safety issues and how unpractical it was to do all of this, leading to the abandonment of the plan.
378	15211	6	3	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building was unrealistic because there was a lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan. As a new form of transportation, dirigibles were not inherently safe. This was proven tragically true when the German dirigible, ""Hindenburg"", exploded in 1937, highlighting the extreme dangers involved. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not addressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flammable dirigibles above a dense population is profoundly unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to weigh down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create for the city below. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique and modern. Ultimately, the Empire State building builders encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because the concept was far past the capabilities and safety standards of their age."
379	15212	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are that dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage and loss of life in the urban environment. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind, which would make maneuvering and securing a large airship incredibly difficult. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building's structure and to the mooring mast itself. The combination of volatile fuel and unpredictable weather conditions created an insurmountable challenge. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, and the idea was ultimately deemed unfeasible.
380	15213	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation; significant financial investment was made into the building's framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself, prioritizing aesthetics over pure function. Ultimately, the mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing an immense fire hazard. Weather, such as violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mast, as high-altitude winds made stable docking a practical impossibility.
381	15214	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is that the architects made the Empire State Building more dirigibles. The architects put the thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building that is held by the cable tether. This single tether point, however, concentrated immense stress on the structure. The dirigible's have to go through the wind pressure which was about eleven hundred feet below, creating powerful and unpredictable air currents. The frame of the Empire State Building have to be strong and it cost more than sixty thousand dollars of modification to made the building's framework stronger to bear these new loads. The architects changed the design and made something new, but the fundamental challenges remained. The architects have a difficult obstacles of building the Empire State Building is to make it dirigibles, a goal that ultimately proved to be impractical despite their efforts.
382	15215	6	3	"During the construction of the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, architects and builders were faced with many obstacles. Before the mooring mast was installed at the top of the building, it became evident that ""the stress of the dirigible's load... would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that changes would need to be made in the framework in order to support the weight, requiring significant and costly structural reinforcement. In addition, safety, weather, and legal issues were at hand. Filled with flamable gas, there was always a risk of a dirigible catching fire, and in an urban area the damage would be extremely bad, posing a grave threat to the densely populated city below. Winds at the top of the building were also dangerous. Air currents were ""violent"" and ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"" (paragraph @NUM2), making a stable connection nearly impossible. Normally, the ships would be weighted down, but, again, this was not possible in a city. The last issue builders faced was the law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Although there was a law clearly against it, two dirigibles attempted to dock. Both attempts were failures and it became clear that the Empire State Building would not be able to serve as a dirigible landing, rendering the ambitious concept obsolete."
383	15216	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it, necessitating expensive structural modifications. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal, creating an unacceptable safety risk. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe. These combined issues of structural integrity, public safety, and unpredictable weather ultimately doomed the plan.
384	15217	6	3	The dirigibles faced some problems when they tried to dock them. The frist reason would be that flying an airship that low over a urban area is against the law, creating an immediate legal barrier. Even though it is against the law they tried it anyways and faced more problems, such as, the winds. The one time that they tried they couldn't dock it because the winds are too strong and unpredictable, which violently buffeted the airship and prevented a secure connection to the mooring mast. This single, failed attempt demonstrated the fundamental impracticality of the docking scheme.
385	15218	6	3	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof because it would be able to support it; the existing framework was insufficient for the concentrated load. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame, exacerbating the structural issue. To fix this problem the @ORGANIZATION1 steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible, a complex and costly engineering challenge that highlighted the difficulties of the project.
386	15219	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the dirigibles were not ever able to dock atop the Empire State Building because it was a question of safety. The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are fueled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This was tragically demonstrated when the Hindenburg, a German-made vessel, burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happened in the densely populated New York City. Also, this was a question of safety because the powerful and unpredictable winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Lastly, there is a law prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban areas, so the ships could not legally fly in New York City airspace. These combined safety concerns ultimately prevented the ambitious docking plan from becoming a reality.
387	15220	6	3	"In the article, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the author talks about the many obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The first obstacle they faced involved dropping the mast onto the building's flat roof. This task would not be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the building's structural frame, requiring significant reinforcement. Another problem they faced was nature. The violent winds at that altitude would cause the massive dirigible to swivel dangerously around the mast, posing a risk to the ship and the building. The greatest obstacle involved safety. Lots of blimps outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen, rather than the safer helium. Hydrogen makes the dirigibles more likely to cause a catastrophic explosion, and risk many lives of the people of New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York prohibited the balloons from docking, as airships were forbidden from flying dangerously close over urban areas. These many obstacles were faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as mentioned in the article."
388	15221	6	3	The idea of dirigibles being able to dock at such an altitude to begin with was fundamentally foolish. First off, trying to tie a thousand-foot dirigible to a building by a single tether adds huge stress to the building's frame, creating a significant engineering challenge. They were able to fix that problem with structural reinforcements, but the main issue they couldn't fix was mother nature. The wind speed at that height is incredibly violent and would cause the massive ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast, making any attempt to board or disembark passengers impossibly dangerous. The combination of these insurmountable physical challenges meant that overall the project was just doomed to fail from the very start, a vision that was never practical.
389	15222	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was nature itself. According to the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would make it difficult for the dirigible to get close enough to the mooring mast to get tied up, and even after it is tied up the wind would cause it to keep moving around the mooring mast, making it impossible for passengers to exit safely. Another obstacle in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the text it states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" presenting a legal barrier that could not be overcome. A final, and perhaps greatest obstacle against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is safety. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This creates immense safety hazards not only for passengers and employees of the dirigible but also for the densely populated area below, that is downtown New York, ensuring the plan was abandoned."
390	15223	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it describes many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to construct the Empire State Building, but on top of that they had to design a functional mooring mast at the very top. Four-term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast,"" highlighting the complex coordination required. Another obstacle builders faced was that having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not structurally sound. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications, a significant financial investment. No matter how the builders constructed the Empire State Building, they still faced nature as an insurmountable obstacle with its high-altitude winds. These are key examples of the challenges builders faced in their ultimately unsuccessful attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
391	15224	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include, poor designing, nature, and lack of landing area. Due to the poor designing initiative of Al Smith, the Age of Dirigibles had a concern on where to land them, as the initial concept was not thoroughly engineered. Nature itself was a big obstacle as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind made this hard for the dirigibles to land, creating unstable conditions for any docking attempt. The last obstacle was the lack of landing area for these enormous balloons, which required a vast and stable space. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he took it, but these fundamental issues ultimately prevented its success."
392	15225	6	3	"Allowing a dirigibles to dock upon the top of the Empire State Building, would leave architects faced with challenging scenarios. Adding a thousand foot dirigible onto the top of the building would add immense stress to the frame. A single cable tether to the blimp would not help the stress and could even exacerbate the structural strain. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (Lusted. @NUM1) Consequently, the frame of the Building would have to be significantly modified to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason why it was never fully constructed was because of safety. Most dirigibles outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, a highly flammable gas. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area."" (Lusted. @NUM2). This makes travel outside the @LOCATION1 with dirigibles more difficult and highlighted the inherent dangers. Nature itself was a great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The back of the ship will swivel around and around the mast cause of winds, making a secure connection nearly impossible. ""The winds on top of the building shifts due to violent air currents."" (Lusted, @NUM3). This wasn't practical nor safe for the ship, its passengers, or the city below. These obstacles leaves builders faced with unrealized challenges to over come, sealing the fate of the ambitious project."
393	15226	6	3	"Builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle in docking dirigibles was the framework of the building itself, which was not originally designed for such a purpose. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This shows the amount of work that needed to be done just on the structure of the building to handle the additional loads. Another hardship was that most dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with highly flamable hydrogen rather than the safer helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" This demonstrated how dangerous the hydrogen could be, posing a catastrophic risk to the city. Lastly, dirigibles could be weighed down by lead weights for stabilization. ""using these at the Empire State Building, would be dangling over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The concern was that if the lead weights dropped they could kill someone on the streets below. Many hardships were brought about trying to dock dirigibles at the empire state building, proving the concept to be unfeasible."
394	15227	6	3	And the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experts and learn all they could about how dirigibles themselves worked, a complex field of aeronautics. It took engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a plan on how to make it work, coordinating across great distances. Just adding the mast would never work on its own. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add a ton of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be strengthened to bear the dynamic loads. Making the mast appealing to look at to took resources and careful design consideration to integrate it with the building's iconic aesthetic. Ultimately though, all the plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem, presenting insurmountable difficulties. When currents are violent up in the air around the mast, which would cause the blimp the swing around dangerously, threatening a catastrophic accident. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in the urban New York would be crushed by falling debris and fire. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition to the skyscraper's spire.
395	15228	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea that were evident from the outset. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable and posed a grave fire hazard. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire, a tragic event that underscored the danger. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting, creating a highly unstable environment. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind, preventing a secure mooring. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city, a regulation designed for public safety. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into populated urban areas. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively and was doomed from the start."
396	15229	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the empire state building then having a giant dirigible moor on to it would cause stress on the building and could pull the mast right off causing it to weigh the dirigible down to the people and buildings it could cause death and destruction. The immense force exerted by a moored airship, especially during gusty conditions, presented a significant structural risk to the skyscraper itself. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They dont want the mast to be done when the whole building is only on floor @NUM1 out of 102, as the mast's installation needed to be perfectly synchronized with the completion of the building's upper floors and its core structural support system. This careful coordination was essential to ensure the mast was integrated properly from both a construction and an engineering perspective.
397	15230	6	3	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel, potentially leading to structural instability at such a great height. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable and could lead to a catastrophic fire if ignited. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians on the streets far below. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas due to the inherent dangers of such low-altitude flight paths. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well thought out, ultimately proving to be an unworkable concept.
398	15231	6	3	"One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" New York City is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible, making the skyscraper's pinnacle the only conceivable spot. The builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building without significant structural modification. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame, requiring extensive reinforcement. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times, creating hazardous conditions for any approaching aircraft. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building, making a secure and stable connection nearly impossible. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area, creating a legal barrier to the entire operation. Therefore, the dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building as originally envisioned."
399	15232	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. For example ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" which describes that the problem that the builders would have to face if they applied the mast and with the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would mess up the foundation of the building. This immense transfer of force posed a serious risk to the structural integrity of the entire skyscraper. So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building while still accommodating the airship. Another example is ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast, a task that was both complex and costly. These fundamental engineering challenges proved to be major hurdles in the plan."
400	15233	6	3	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the building of the Empire State Building had many obstacles the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark was the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and greatest obstacle of all was nature surrounding the Empire State Building.The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is the dirigibles couldn't even try to attempt to reach the building, as it was legally prohibited. In December 1930, one dirigable approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough fearing the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires of nearby structures. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even installed which meant the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigable, which could get tiring for the ground crew. The greatest obstacle of all was nature. Winds at the top of the building were really strong due to the violent wind currents, which could cause the dirigable to keep moving, even when tied up to the mast, making any docking procedure perilous.Overall, the nature of weather was the huge obstacle that ultimately made the concept unfeasible.
401	15234	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people on the ground. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem, risking catastrophic loss of life. Another obstacle was the violent and unpredictable air currents at that height, which made it extremely hard to land a large airship safely. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why the landing process would be dangerously unstable. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas, a regulation that presented a legal barrier. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if the technical and safety challenges were overcome, they wouldn't be able to do it legally. These are just three of the significant obstacles that ultimately prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from successfully docking dirigibles."
402	15235	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated heart of New York City. Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe, especially considering the flammable nature of the hydrogen gas used in many airships. In addition to the public safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature itself. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the powerful air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast in an uncontrollable and hazardous manner. Lastly, there was a federal law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it explicitly illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building or attempt a docking procedure. These combined factors created an insurmountable barrier to the plan's success.
403	15236	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant obstacles while trying to build the mast for dirigible docking. One primary problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building's structure if a dirigible was to dock there. This was because of the high wind speeds at that altitude and of the sheer size and weight of the dirigible pulling on the mast. The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of structural modifications to the building's framework to account for this additional pressure. Another major obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed by regulation to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. Eventually, these obstacles, combined with other pressing safety issues such as the hydrogen inside the blimp being highly flammable, collectively caused the ambitious idea to disappear.
404	15237	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to try to dock dirgibles there. One of the challenges they faced was how to make sure the building wouldn't collapse if they docked a large foot dirigible on the top. They had to make about sixty thousand dollars worth of changes to the building's frame to be able to handle a dirigible. Another obstacle they faced was how to dock a dirigible at the top of the building without endangering the densely populated area of down town New York. ""Most dirgibles outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The builders faced many obstacles by trying to be able to dock a dirigible but it was ultimately impossible from the start."
405	15238	6	3	Obstacles the builders had to try and over come were the extra preshure on the frame of the building and the diffuclt docking process, also the high speed winds that made it basicly impossiBle to do. The structural frame required significant reinforcement to handle the strain of a moored airship, which was a considerable engineering challenge. The docking process itself was fraught with difficulty, requiring precise maneuvers that were hard to execute. Furthermore, the high-speed winds at the skyscraper's summit created a turbulent environment that made stable docking basically impossible to achieve safely. These fundamental issues proved too great to overcome for the dirigible docking plan.
406	15239	6	3	Based on The Mooring Mast article, by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building face numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their dream put New York on the forefront of modern travel never was fulfilled. First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework because of the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add significant stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in highly populated areas such as New York, where a fire would risk countless lives. Also, the violent and unpredictable winds on top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and not swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be unsafe dangling from a building over a city. Finally the idea violated a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making the entire concept legally unfeasible. All of the contributing obstacles the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles unsuccessful, and the mast ultimately served only as a landmark.
407	15240	6	3	Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the empire state buildings mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. One problem was figuring out how to reinforce the mast so that the load could transfer to the foundation instead of ripping off the top half of the building. The immense force exerted by a docked airship, combined with the powerful wind gusts at such a height, presented a serious engineering challenge. The structural integrity of the entire tower top had to be considered to ensure it could withstand these forces. Ultimately, the solutions required for these structural concerns were complex and integral to the mast's initial construction, yet they were just the first of many hurdles.
408	15241	6	3	"The concept of a docking mast for the Empire State Building met with failure because of a variety of reasons. One of the major problems was that it was directly over the downtown area of New York City which is very densely populated. After the Hindenburg fire in New Jersey, ""the owners... realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area."" The second major obstacle was controlling a dirigible in the often violent winds at the top of the tower. It was the practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights but over a civilian area this was ""neither practical nor safe."" Another important reason why the builders faced obstacles was the already existing law that prohibited low-flying aircraft over cities. Despite the two dirigibles that approached the mooring mast, neither managed to allow passengers to disembark, and the idea was ""quietly dropped"" as it should have been. There were too many obstacles for it to succeed, sealing the fate of this ambitious but impractical venture."
409	15242	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (L¸sted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (L¸sted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach, rendering the mast obsolete."
410	15243	6	3	"The architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself. One of the problems was that most dirigibles outside of the country use hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make the blimps buoyant. If one of those blimps ever caught fire like the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, then it would put many citizens in jeopardy. This densely populated area would be much more hazardous than a rural area in New Jersey. The last problem they faced was the law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 no foreign dirigible could dock and refuel there because of the type of gas keeping it afloat, while no @CAPS2 dirigible could dock and refuel because of the law prohibiting it, the idea of a mooring mast quickly diminished from the citizens imaginations and they looked to modern transportation such as airplanes, leaving the mast as a monument to a forgotten ambition."
411	15244	6	3	"Besides the facts that docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on the Empire State Building would cost over @MONEY1 and add a lot of stress to the building's frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream. Unfortunately, he couldn't do that. There are @NUM1 big reasons. In paragraph @NUM2 it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium, a gas known for its high combustibility. Just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was tragically destroyed in a fire in New Jersey, illustrating the grave danger. Paragraph @NUM2 says docking the dirigibles is plain dangerous because the wind would cause them to @CAPS1 all over, rather than being docked on the ground and being weighed down securely. Lastly, it wasn't legal. Paragraph @NUM4 states ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was another practical reason."" The dirigibles would not be high enough in the air to be legal, and it was highly dangerous because pedestrians below could be harmed by falling debris or a potential crash. These combined factors made the ambitious plan unfeasible."
412	15245	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 it shows an obstacle the builders faced. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is because of the wind, a powerful and unpredictable force. The wind would shift due to violent air currents swirling around the skyscraper's pinnacle, creating a highly unstable environment for a large, buoyant aircraft. This constant atmospheric turbulence presented a fundamental and insurmountable challenge to safe docking operations, ultimately dooming the venture."
413	15246	6	3	In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a mooring mast was necessary. One could not simply place one on the Empire State Building because it would add significant stress to the building's frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the powerful wind pressure would add further stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety concerns. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized the scale of disaster it would cause if it happened in a densely populated area like New York. Nature was also a major obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as securely as it could be in an open field. It was a risk not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such elevation over urban areas, creating a legal barrier. These were the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, leading to the concept's abandonment.
414	15247	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When it says in the passage, ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" this means that the architects would have to modify and substantially strengthen the building for a ""thousand-foot dirigible"" to land there. Over @MONEY1 of changes had to be made for this structural reinforcement. Safety was another critical problem. Dirigibles from other countries often used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been devastated by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there, mirroring the Hindenburg disaster. Nature itself was also a persistent problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would cause the dirigible to swivel around dangerously, making a stable connection nearly impossible. The architects came in contact with many complex problems that ultimately proved too great to overcome for the docking plan to succeed."
415	15248	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have to strengthen the frame because of the immense wind pressure, and the pressure from the single cable tethering the airship. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than the safer alternative of helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents around the tall structure. Even if they could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around uncontrollably. They also suggested using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger from the heavy objects. The last obstacle faced was the fact that there was a law about airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the entire operation from the start.
416	15249	6	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and foundation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building to counteract this immense force. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from those in the United States) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire, a danger tragically highlighted by the Hindenburg disaster. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast in an unpredictable and hazardous manner. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the builders were faced with too many insurmountable obstacles for it to work.
417	15250	6	3	While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al Smith's idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems; what seemed like a visionary concept during planning revealed its flaws during construction. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey with the Hindenburg. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area like Manhattan, leading to catastrophic loss of life. Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down securely. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier to the entire endeavor. The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building, ultimately dooming the ambitious project to failure.
418	15251	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe, posing significant risks to both the airships and the public. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding in their ambitious plan. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible, making a stable landing nearly impossible. If this happened then they never would have been able to land the aircraft safely. The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger from a potential fall or fire. There was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area, rendering the mooring mast functionally useless. It was just too dangerous to attempt, and the combination of these factors ensured the docking plan was abandoned.
419	15252	6	3	"Many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were issues that should have been thought about before construction began. At such a height there were whirlwind issues that could push the dirigible in undesired directions, making precise maneuvering exceptionally difficult. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" (Smith 1). After the Hindenburg exploded the concerns for the same thing happening was a large safety concern, casting a shadow over the entire concept of hydrogen-filled airships in an urban setting. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Smith 2 Line 6). This stark realization of potential disaster over the city skyline ultimately proved to be the most significant deterrent to the plan's implementation."
420	15253	6	3	"There were several obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. First, if a dirigible was ""moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The framework was not strong enough for this initial design, requiring a substantial and costly reinforcement. But the main reason was safety. It was known that most foreign dirigibles used ""hydrogen rather than helium"", which is highly flammable, creating an inherent fire hazard. Things wouldn't go well if there was an incident in a populated place like New York, where falling debris and fire could rain down on the streets. Also, the winds were a persistent issue, causing the ship to swivel around, and lead couldn't be used to weigh it down for safety reasons related to the building's structure. Finally, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which makes it illegal for any dirigible to even come close to a building, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. All of these reasons contributed to why docking dirigibles would come with many obstacles, ensuring the mooring mast remained an unused architectural novelty."
421	15254	6	3	Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable and volatile. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a catastrophic fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The potential for a similar disaster occurring over a major city highlighted the immense risks involved with hydrogen-filled airships. This tragic event underscored the inherent dangers of their proposed use and contributed to the declining interest in utilizing the building's mooring mast for such purposes, ultimately proving the concept to be fraught with peril.
422	15255	6	3	"From the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make it accessible for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the powerful and unpredictable winds at such a high altitude. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making a stable connection nearly impossible. The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not swing around dangerously, but they also needed a way to support the immense weight of the dirigible because of the stress it would place on the already heavy building. These are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with, presenting a formidable set of engineering and safety challenges that tested the limits of contemporary design."
423	15256	6	3	"After reading the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it is easy to see that this project faced numerous obstacles to overcome. The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot on their plate in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the builders had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame and also construct a specialized mast to which dirigibles could dock. If there was to be ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" it would add an enormous amount of stress to the entire structure. This is why the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened, and ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The builders also had to construct a mast for the dirigibles, which in the end was ""...the architects who designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" This idea of adding a mast for dirigibles to the Empire State Building created much work for the builders, illustrating the significant obstacles they had to overcome, from modifying the frame to constructing the mast, which greatly increased their workload and the complexity of the project."
424	15257	6	3	"Many things went wrong while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. First, allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" requiring costly structural reinforcements. These dirigibles, often filled with hydrogen, are highly flammable and posed a significant danger over a very populated place like New York City. The winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating instability. Furthermore, if lead weights were used for ballast, they could fall from the dirigible and kill civilians on the streets below. The biggest obstacle, however, was that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This ambitious plan seemed to be a good idea on paper, but when actually attempted, it was far too unrealistic and hazardous to implement successfully."
425	15258	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area within the dense urban environment. To solve this problem, former governor Al Smith championed the construction of a mooring mast atop the skyscraper. This innovative structure would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours to refuel or disembark passengers. However, this solution introduced its own set of complex challenges related to safety and practicality. Despite the initial vision, the mooring mast was rarely, if ever, used for its intended purpose, marking the ambitious project as an ultimately impractical endeavor.
426	15259	6	3	"the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles and challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including how to attach the mast and how to move people between the dirigible and the building. In order to attach the mast where the dirigibles would land, the builders could not simply fasten it with the cable teather to the top of the building. This would ""add stress to the building's frame"" with the combined pressure of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. Therefore, the builders had to get the pressure down into the ground by strengthening and altering the building's steel frame, a significant structural undertaking. Another obstacle the builder's faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to a dirigible floating in the air. The dirigibles would only be tethered by their front ends, but gondola, where the passengers rode, was located underneath the dirigible. this meant the construction of ""a gangplank to an open observation platform"" from which the people and luggage had to be moved @NUM1 floor by a special elevator, a complex and risky procedure. Although the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in building the mast, the one they really should have considered was the dager and impracticalness of docking dirigibles @NUM2 stories over New York City."
427	15260	6	3	There are many problems the dirigibles had with docking. The one problem there was is a lack of suitable landing space. There was also the problem of winds. The wind would cause a major problem for if they could dock. The wind could cause it to spin around the building causing injuries to people or the dirigible, making a stable connection nearly impossible. If it's swong around an hit the building it could cause structural damage. The dirigible could also explode into flames if a spark is caused from it hitn the building, a catastrophic risk given the flammable gas used for lift. It could end up like the hindenburge, a disaster that highlighted the inherent dangers of such an ambitious docking scheme.
428	15261	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe, requiring extensive engineering revisions. Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating an uncontrollable and hazardous situation. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there."
429	15262	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles (Blimps) to dock there was that there were way too many risks that were being taken to make this mast and it was just too dangerous.I think that the mast opposed too many risks because for one it would be flying too low and two, if it caught on fire or was hit by lightning it would explode and people would get seriously hurt, OR the mast could snap off from the immense strain! As @PERSON1 said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.""@CAPS1 @PERSON1 Clavan means is that the fact that there are so many problems with mooring air ships to this ""mast"" that it just isn't safe to go through with right now, a conclusion that ultimately proved correct."
430	15263	6	3	Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldnt just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the dirigibles load and the wind would add stress, necessitating a reinforced structural support system. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move unpredictably. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways, presenting a final, insurmountable legal barrier.
431	15264	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, the expectations of the project were unrealistic because there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Consequently, even if they found a safe way to land dirigibles they would be breaking the law, rendering the entire concept legally problematic from the start. Second, there were ""violent air currents."" When they tried to dock the dirigible on the building, it could not get close enough to it to land because of the wind, which created unpredictable and dangerous conditions for any attempted mooring. Lastly, it was a huge safety hazard. Most dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is very flammable, especially in a densely populated area where a disaster would be catastrophic. After considering the risks, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [bad an] accident could have been."" As a result, dirigibles never fulfilled the expectations of the transportation of the future and they did not dock on the Empire State Building, marking the end of an ambitious but impractical vision."
432	15265	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof. A primary concern was structural, as a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building and held by a single cable could add immense stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate the situation, requiring substantial engineering changes. That wasnt the only obstacle; money was one of the problems as well, with ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building, representing a major financial investment for an unproven concept. Safety was an obstacle as well, as ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacle they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building? Think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people, making the potential for tragedy unimaginably high."
433	15266	6	3	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obstacles in their plan to dock dirigibles. One obstacle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanning over a thousand feet, therefore in a city of closely packed buildings, there were not many suitable open areas to land such enormous aircraft. Another obstacle they had to overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to urban areas, creating a legal barrier that complicated the entire endeavor. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obstacle was nature itself, which proved to be an insurmountable challenge. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. 2-paragraph 4), making a stable and secure docking procedure practically impossible. All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic, as the combined issues of space, regulation, and weather could not be solved."
434	15267	6	3	The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered problems from its introduction until its conclusion. The first problem was the original design of the building itself. The original design did not include a dirigible docking station, so it was not conceived to handle such a function. When plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible, posing a serious structural risk. To adjust, an additional sixty thousand dollars were spent in order to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking, a significant cost for an unproven feature. The next problem became imminent after the Hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen-filled dirigible that caught fire at the Empire State Building would cause significant damage. Moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant and ever-present. Wind proved to be another obstacle, as the force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles securely from the sides. The fact that many tall spires lined the New York City skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to navigate and dock. Finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that law prohibited low flying aircraft in urban areas, making the entire operation illegal.
435	15268	6	3	The problems that the Empire State Building had to face were so significant that they could not solve the problem of mooring air ships to a fixed mast. The immense height made the operation exceptionally difficult and dangerous, creating challenges that the technology of the time could not safely overcome. Given the combination of structural, financial, and safety concerns, it was deemed prudent to postpone to a later date the installation of the landing gear, an acknowledgment that the ambitious plan was not yet feasible.
436	15269	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles were multifaceted. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower to serve as a mooring mast. They would have to make the Empire State Building strong enough to withstand the powerful wind blowing around up on top, which posed a significant structural challenge. Furthermore, in the long run they would have to face the law, as aviation regulations presented a legal hurdle. These are the primary obstacles that the builders had to face, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical.
437	15270	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles with their plan for dirigibles to tie to the mast. They could not proceed because the way of the height of the building was so high that dirigibles would not be able to keep stable while unloading. For example, the Goodyear blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of newspapers on a rope dangling from the blimp, demonstrating the operational difficulty. Other obstacles were that dirigibles outside the United States had hydrogen in them instead of helium, and hydrogen was very flammable, adding a layer of danger to the entire concept. These combined issues proved insurmountable for the dirigible docking plan.
438	15271	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles. The first was nature itself. Even if the dirigible was tethered up to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to unpredictable wind currents, making the process hazardous. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, creating a regulatory barrier. Although two dirigibles attempted but failed to dock successfully, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared, marking the end of this visionary but flawed concept.
439	15272	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame; the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this structural issue. Also, the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind; this is usually fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usually land, but dangling that over a city is very dangerous. Another problem is the law stating no aircraft flying too low over urban areas. Finally, dirigibles never caught on as a mainstream form of transport. So the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to make a dirigible docking station, and the mast was never used for its intended purpose.
440	15273	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame. To prevent this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified, strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Secondly, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners realized that if one of the hydrogen dirigibles were to catch fire just like the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the accident could be much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle that the builders were faced with was violent air currents while the dirigible was tethered. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to winds; using lead weights to weigh the back down, where they would be dangling above pedestrians, would neither be practical nor safe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.
441	15274	6	3	"By attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles that they faced was the re-desgning of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" that meant that they had to make modifications (over @MONEY1 worth) to reinforce the structure. Another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a significant fire risk. And the greatest obstacle that the builders had was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Even if the Dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasnt safe, making a stable and secure docking procedure nearly impossible to achieve."
442	15275	6	3	Based on this excerpt, the architects had to go through a lot of obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First they had to redesign the building's frameworks because the weight of the dirigible would add stress to it, requiring costly and complex structural reinforcements. Then they added two more floors to the top of the building. They were to be the boarding area for the passengers, featuring a special promenade for embarking and disembarking. Two months after they finally reframed the building, they put the American flag at the top of the mooring mast in a celebratory gesture. Soon after, they realized proceeding with these designs were foolish because it was unsafe and not practical, as the fundamental challenges of wind and physics could not be overcome. Those are obstacles that the architects had to go through in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building.
443	15276	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did, requiring constant and precise piloting. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building."
444	15277	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a serious problem if the dirigible burst into flames and fire rained down on, ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" endangering thousands of lives. Another obstacle to the creation of the mooring mast was the wind, which, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles would have to be, ""weighted down with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" This would be, ""neither practical nor safe."" because the weights could fall and kill people. The final obstacle for building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the mooring mast faced many problems, ""that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."""
445	15278	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame, necessitating expensive structural modifications. Another is having all the flammable gases above a highly populated area, which posed a catastrophic fire hazard to the city below. Also there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier to the entire concept. Lastly the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship to unstable, preventing a safe and secure mooring process. These combined issues rendered the ambitious docking plan fundamentally unworkable from the start.
446	15279	6	3	In the excerpt there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith saw an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the top of the building, allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. With this idea, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts by taking tours of the equipment and observing the mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. These consultations revealed the practical difficulties involved. Now as you can see the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately making the plan unfeasible.
447	15280	6	3	"The construction of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a lot of work. They had to spend a whole lot of money and it wasn't an easy job. They spent over sixty thousand dollars on just modifications. I know this because in the text it said ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building frame work."" As you can see they spent a lot of money on the mooring mast. Also it wasn't an easy job to make everything work; there was a lot of things they had to worry about like safety issues. I know it wasn't an easy job because the text also said ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof,"" indicating significant structural challenges. As you can see they struggled to make the mooring mast accomplish its intended purpose successfully."
448	15281	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building the workers faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was safety. While the dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked its body would sway in the breeze. This led to a question of safety for the passengers getting on and off. Also there was no safe way to weigh the dirigible down, like when the dirigible lands in a field; any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians. Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area. The main obstacle was nature itself. There are very violent winds at the top of the Empire State Building which would cause the dirigible to sway dangerously. Docking at the Empire State Building was too complicated for the idea to be completed, proving it was ultimately impractical.
449	15282	6	3	"In some cases builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety. As stated in the reading, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: dirigibles outside of Germany used hydrogen, which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible was to catch fire on top of that building it could do a lot of damage. The next reason is there are ""laws against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The Empire State Building was built in the middle of downtown; if something was to go wrong the dirigibles could harm a lot of people. Another reason is because of nature. The author stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This put the dirigibles at risk of hitting that building or another. The last reason is because ""the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed."" If the law and safety hadn't been a problem there would be no way to land a dirigible because they didn't have the things needed to land it. The obstacles made the plan fail because they failed to fully look over their plan before proceeding."
450	15283	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the weather, and the Building Frame. The first obstacle was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The wind was an obstacle because if a big gust of wind came it could knock building materials or even workers off the building, posing a severe hazard. A second obstacle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady under the strain. These are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, highlighting the project's inherent difficulties.
451	15284	6	3	The mooring mast was a failure from the start, conceived with ambition but flawed in its fundamental premise. The builders and architects were not looking at the practical problems that would be present but only at how to build the most impressive structure. The first main problem the building workers faced when attempting to allow these dirigibles to land was actually constructing a mast atop the highest building in the world, a formidable engineering challenge in itself. Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the building's framework to support the zeppelin's weight, which would put immense stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1,250 ft above the ground. Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zeppelins over heavily crowded areas was safety. The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out. For example, some of those zeppelins used hydrogen to stay aloft, and if a hydrogen-filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty imminent that people below would be harmed. This project seems to present far too many obstacles for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp, ultimately rendering the concept unworkable.
452	15285	6	3	The Mooring Mast describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was competing with the Chrysler Building in being the tallest building, a race driven by prestige. Al Smith, the governor at that time, didn't want to be beat and, being the governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building, ambitiously developing it into a dirigible dock. As time went on, the building ran into more problems. Tying a thousand-foot dirigible to the building would add significant stress to the frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, as the frame around the building wasn't durable enough to hold a blimp. The building would risk collapse while potentially taking other buildings down. Sixty-thousand dollars went into re-fining the frame, but in the end, the building still failed to be a viable dock. After the frame was stable enough, more problems occurred. The greatest reason was one of safety; dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it was highly flammable. Not only did the reason of safety of people go against the building, so did the law. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Once Al Smith realized even the law forbade this, all plans that rose into action stopped, and the Empire State Building remained the same, its mast a monument to a failed vision.
453	15286	6	3	"When the Empire State Building was created it was supposed to be a ""pit stop"" for dirigibles, known today as blimps, representing a futuristic vision for the city. It was meant to be the modern way of travel, but many problems surfaced changing the plans almost immediately. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which was a major safety hazard for a densely populated urban area. Another problem presented itself in the form of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier. If anything were to go wrong with the ship, such as a fire or a crash, many people on the ground would be put in danger. The harsh wind nature at such high altitudes would provide the risk of puncturing the blimp against buildings or causing it to break free, also endangering the people below it and making the entire venture too perilous to pursue."
454	15287	6	3	The obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were safety, nature, and U.S. law. Safety was a major obstacle because most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a catastrophic risk over a city. Nature itself was another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable and secure mooring nearly impossible. One final obstacle that would halt the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was U.S. law. The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, a regulation designed for public safety. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, presenting an insurmountable legal challenge that sealed the project's fate.
455	15288	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced many obstacles in their attempt to create a docking station for airships. One of the obstacles was that the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it difficult to secure the massive aircraft safely. Another obstacle was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which could easily throw a dirigible off course and cause a collision. These were some of the significant obstacles the builders faced, demonstrating the inherent dangers and impracticalities of the entire concept from the very beginning."
456	15289	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph fourteen said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" In planning for the mast, builders did not account for the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which made the precise maneuvering required for docking nearly impossible. The greatest reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its purpose was because of safety issues. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin, Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Owners of the Empire State Building then recognized that if the same incident was to take place in New York, more lives would be lost. Builders of the Empire State Building failed to recognize the dangers of the mooring mast, leading to the ultimate abandonment of the ambitious project."
457	15290	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a couple of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders had was with the stress of the dirigibles load as said in the excerpt in paragraph. The immense weight and pull of a docked airship posed a significant structural challenge. Another obstacle they had with landing the dirigibles to dock was that they had to modify and strengthened the steel frame of the Empire State Building. They needed to do that so it can accommodate this new situation, which is to get dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. This extensive and costly reinforcement was a major undertaking, highlighting the practical difficulties of the plan.
458	15291	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" the people attempting to make dirigible docks had ended up with big obstacles in reaching that goal. Before even adding the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building, the workers had to modify the frame or otherwise ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The mooring mast goal was really starting to be doubtful when one problem wasn't realized. Safety, as most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of helium, for example ""a German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, since hydrogen is very flammable. Because of realizing this, the situation could've been ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also ""nature itself"", was the greatest obstacle, as shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around, even if it makes it to the mooring mast. The dirigibles could use weights, but using them at the Empire State building, ""while they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" These combined issues of structural integrity, volatile gas, and unpredictable weather rendered the concept unworkable."
459	15292	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that they needed a strong enough cable so it could hold the blimp, the passengers and any additional weight. This was a primary engineering concern from the outset. Another obstacle was how could they manage that with the power of the wind that high up in the air, which created unstable and hazardous conditions for a large, buoyant aircraft. Another reason is if the airship were to dock there would be pedestrians at the base of the building, placing the public at risk from falling debris or a potential accident. Another reason is the building structure would have to be reinforced to hold up under the new stresses. These fundamental challenges proved too great to overcome for a safe and functional dirigible dock.
460	15293	6	3	"In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the obstacles faced was that putting a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. This made the builders have to modify the frame, a significant and complex engineering task. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" This would put great danger to the people of New York, a risk that became terrifyingly clear with the Hindenburg disaster. That was a huge problem the builders faced. The builders at the Empire State Building faced many obstacles but safety and reconstruction were just some of those problems that ultimately prevented the mooring mast from ever being used as intended."
461	15294	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to land there. The most prominent obstacle was that posed by nature, which was that there was always a constant change in wind direction, so the dirigibles would not be able to land safely or remain stable once attached. The architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps to counteract the swinging, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below, as a dropped weight would cause a catastrophe. Also, the building had to be a certain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated, but this introduced new dangers. If it was not an something exploded, or if a ship using flammable hydrogen gas had an accident, the heavily populated city of New York would be in grave danger. In theory, the mast for dirigibles was a revolutionary idea, but in reality it just wouldn't work due to these insurmountable challenges.
462	15295	6	3	"There were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles were that architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. This is because as it says on paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" potentially causing structural damage. Another obstacles were making the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose. It was very hard to make the mooring mast fulfill its purpose because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it impossible for a pilot to maintain a steady position long enough to dock. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building, ultimately rendering the concept impractical."
463	15296	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to face was the constant change in nature and how it could affect the dirigibles. The dirigibles would ""swivel around"" because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could put pedestrians on the street in danger because the ship is on top moving and could be unstable, potentially breaking free. Another obstacle is safety. Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Other countries ships could set on fire in the United States and put people in danger, creating a massive fire risk high above the city. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet and loading off could be unstable because of the winds, making passenger transfer perilous. The last obstacle faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore it was illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the buildings safely. All these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger, leading to the mast's eventual abandonment."
464	15297	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building obstacles can be described in the following ways. First of all, the main obstacle was the nature of the mast and the unpredictable weather conditions. They described it as, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1), which would violently swing any docked airship. Secondly, the dirigibles would dangle on top of the building, which wasn't safe for pedestrians below who would be at risk from falling debris or a complete mishap. Lastly, there was a law for airships that couldn't fly too low or too high, creating a legal barrier to the entire operation. The above explains the significant obstacles of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, proving the concept was flawed from the start."
465	15298	6	3	When the architects and builders were planning on how to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced many obstacles.  An example of an obstacle they faced was they had to construct the mast so it wouldnt fall off when a dirigible docked, requiring immense structural integrity.  They couldnt use cable.  tether to hold the mast down because it put to much stress on the building's frame and foundation, risking a catastrophic failure.  Another obstacle the builders had to face was how to strengthen the Empire State Building's frame to handle the additional loads and dynamic forces from a moving airship.  In order to get the Empire State Building's frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant financial burden for a feature of questionable utility.  Those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face, which contributed to the ultimate failure of the dirigible mooring plan.
466	15299	6	3	In the building of @ORGANIZATION1, the competition to construct the tallest building in New York City became very competitive. He wanted to construct the biggest building in the city and, when the construction was going on, he decided he wanted to add a top or a hat so that the mast would be able to drop off people directly into the building from airships. But then there was a problem, as they had to consult authorities to get permission to allow it. Irving then let Al know that the entire building project wasn't going to be done on time, specifically because of the complications arising from the mast's addition. That is the central challenge the Empire State building faced during its contraction, a delay caused by an ambitious last-minute design change.
467	15300	6	3	"Throughout the designing and construction stages of the Empire State building's mooring mast, builders and engineers confronted many issues including the distribution of building stress, fire hazards, and the constant shifting caused by winds. During the planning stages, engineers confronted a primary issue of how to alleviate stress on the Empire State Building's frame. According to engineers, making the ""thousand foot dirigible moored at at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame..."" @CAPS1 stated the building would require ""over sixty thousand dollars"" in redesigning and modifying the current building's foundation and framework to handle this new load. Secondly, engineers and builders never initially considered the fire hazards, which they were confronted with after the completion of the mooring mast. The American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, making that gaseous-filled transportation highly flammable. An example of this safety violation occurred with the burning of a dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey, causing builders to reflect on the possible severity of this possible accident occurring in the heavily populated area of New York. Thirdly, New York had ""violent air currents"" which could cause the rear of the dirigibles to swivel and shift unpredictably. The only possible solution was to weigh down the back with lead blocks, but this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" for a city environment. Ultimately, engineers and builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with many problems and concerns that were sometimes only addressed by irrational solutions, highlighting the impracticality of the mast."
468	15301	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was structural; if a dirigible was moored by a single tether, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" posing a significant engineering challenge. Another obstacle was the use of flammable gas; most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and when the Hindenburg was destroyed, builders realized that such an accident would have been much worse if it had happened over a densely populated area like New York City. A third obstacle was the violent wind currents that would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, and the back of the dirigible couldn't be weighted down like in open landing fields because that would cause the weights to dangle dangerously above the pedestrians on the street. These were major obstacles that proved insurmountable, and they are the primary reasons that the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used to dock blimps."
469	15302	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the safety of the city and the dirigibles themselves was a paramount concern. In paragraph thirteen, it states ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, the greatest of obstacles was truly nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" As a dirigible attempted to successfully use the mooring mast, the back end of the blimp would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. There additionally was a law which stated that airships cannot fly that low over an urban area, creating a legal barrier. Thus, the multiple obstacles which were faced through this ""architectural breakthrough"" ultimately destroyed any hope of the building's true purpose ever being realized."
470	15303	6	3	"Constructing anything is always a difficult task, but trying to construct the world's tallest building and have dirigibles being able to dock there is even harder. The workers who were modifying the Empire State Building had numerous obstacles that stood in their way when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The obstacle they could not control was nature herself. The winds were said to be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" according to the excerpt, which made it difficult for dirigibles to dock there, and also made the process dangerous. Also, another factor that was an obstacle for the constructors was the building itself. The structure of the building would have to be modified because the dirigible ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" so constructors would have to reinforce the building to support this tremendous stress from the moored airship. Another obstacle was safety because some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which was extremely flammable and posed a grave danger for the massive population on the ground in the event of an accident. These are a few of the many significant obstacles faced when modifying the Empire State Building for its intended but ultimately impractical purpose."
471	15304	6	3	The Empire State Building was and is the tallest building to ever be built. To make it the tallest building Architects had to design the Mooring Mast, a structure intended to secure airships. In building this mast there were many obstacles to overcome, but even with those obstacles it was still finished ahead of schedule. The Mooring Mast was needed because without it the Empire State Building would not be the tallest in the world, being surpassed by other structures. To make the Mooring Mast work the builders had to overcome some obstacles. One of the main obstacles was to add on the Mast they would have to attach steal from the Mast all the way down to the foundation to ensure structural integrity. Another was After designing the Mast they had to change the original plans for the building to incorporate this new structural support, which complicated the construction process. Ultimately, the mast was completed, securing the building's record height.
472	15305	6	3	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Between the volatile nature of the airships, saftey, and nature, there was no way this idea could ever work. Although the idea was good it was very impracticle.     Saftey was a major problem with this idea. Most Dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium which is more flammable and highly combustible. If the Dirigibles ever broke out into flames over New York City it would burn the whole place down and kill thousands of innocent civilians.      Nature was another big problem. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were shifting all the time, creating unpredictable conditions. The ship would swivel around the moorings mast, making a secure connection nearly impossible. The Dirigibles usually moored in fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down. The weights dangling above peoples heads was very dangerous, posing a constant threat to the public below.     Building the mooring mast was very dangerous and impracticle. It never happened due to saftey and now serves as a tea and soda area for use of sight seers, a testament to the failed but ambitious plan.
473	15306	6	3	On August 29, 1929, The Empire State Building was announced to reach the height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the former governor and a key figure behind the building mentioned that the top would be more than ornamental. It was said that this amazing dream would come true for aviation pioneers of the era. The building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships called dirigibles, otherwise known as blimps. This was thought out to be a great idea for modern transportation. Things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it  was ever constructed. Resons being; Most blimbs from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable, creating a significant fire hazard. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel, and it would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building, which presented a legal barrier. Thus, still leaving the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, but never completing the original goal of a functional airship terminal.
474	15307	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the empire state building. First of all for it to be a 1,250 ft building it would have to have a very strong base to support it and they had to reinforce the base too to be able to mount the mooring mast on top, requiring extensive foundational work. They also faced issues with the strong air currents that flowed above New York, creating turbulent conditions. None of the dirigibles were able to dock because of the high current, which made stable mooring impossible. The mooring mast also placed stress on the frame of the entire structure. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" this proves proves how much difficulty the builders were going to have with the construction of the Empire state building, highlighting the immense engineering challenges involved."
475	15308	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed ballons they can travel for long periods at time of seventy miles per hour. Thoogh dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of travelin modernation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles in the dense urban environment. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there many thoughout changes in the building needed to be considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure from the large airships. To suit the buildings with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable were to much of a risk in the high populated are of New York. Also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude, which was unpredictable and strong. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" A quote by Al Smith. The obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the empire state Building, leading to the concept's ultimate abandonment."
476	15309	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their efforts to make it possible for dirigibles to dock on the mast. One problem was safety, particularly concerning the volatile lifting gas used. Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is, according to the article, ""highly flammable."" The potential for a dirigible to catch fire right over a very populated area would be incredibly dangerous. Nature was another significant factor, as the weather conditions at such a height were unpredictable. ""Violent air currents"" made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock safely. Yet even if these frustrating conditions were not extant, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was explicitly illegal. A law prohibited ""airships [from] flying too low over urban areas,"" which included dirigibles attempting to approach the skyscraper. These fundamental obstacles were ultimately overlooked in the ambitious plans to create the Empire State Building, rendering the docking concept impractical from the start."
477	15310	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Legal restrictions presented an immediate and insurmountable barrier. Laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" Some dirigibles did try to approach, but due to challenging wind conditions and pressing safety reasons the idea was eventually dropped. The safety of all human beings was a primary concern that took part in the decision to abandon the construction, a point tragically emphasized later. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."" This highlighted the inherent risks, especially when dealing with other countries that may not use the safest materials. Furthermore, Mother Nature can be a funny thing, as ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting..."" With the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be tremendously hard for a large airship to land. When building something ambitious, one must always be prepared for such unforeseen obstacles."
478	15311	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The initial challenge was structural; the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top without considering the immense strain. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed and reinforced to handle the additional stress. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project, as the atmospheric conditions at the summit were treacherous. The wind currents were always changing and a large blimp would be susceptible to swirling around uncontrollably. Ultimately, public safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be hovering directly over New York, was to burst into flames, many people on the ground would be killed. In conclusion, these combined structural, natural, and safety obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building.
479	15312	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people on the ground below. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable; the potential death toll would be astronomical over a dense population such as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was the force of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a massive dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was simply not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not permitted was an existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible would be too close to the ground and was not allowed to dock legally. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are too many significant obstacles prohibiting it from becoming a reality.
480	15313	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building envisioned dirigibles mooring at the top, there were some critical flaws in the plan. For one thing, the structural demands were immense; a thousand foot dirigible moored to such a small focal point with the wind pressure and its own load would exert enormous pressure on the building's frame (p. @NUM1). This could potentially lead to the building's collapse due to the incredible strain. Another reason was the hazardous environment at such high altitudes, where the wind is quite violent and would sway the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither ""... practical nor safe."" (p. @NUM2). If something went wrong during the delicate process, the dirigible could take out another building or, worse, fall from the sky. A more practical, legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities. A dirigible mooring to a mast, even at that great height, was explicitly illegal (p. @NUM3). Therefore, with so many formidable obstacles, it was deemed entirely impractical to use the Empire State Building as a high-altitude dock."
481	15314	6	3	There are many significant problems with trying to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building. First, there was the tragic example of the German dirigible called the Hindenburg, which caught fire and was destroyed due to its flammable hydrogen gas. Having a similar dirigible go up in flames over a dense urban area like New York would undoubtedly result in many lives lost. Second, the wind at 1,250 feet in the air is very strong and notoriously unpredictable. There was simply no way for pilots to be sure that the large, buoyant dirigibles could even dock successfully or be controlled once docked to the mast. Lastly, there is a federal law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be against this law for a dirigible to be so close to a skyscraper with so many people in it. Since these problems all presented a serious risk and could result in numerous deaths, the entire idea was wisely thrown out.
482	15315	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the beginning preparation, the builders thought it would be a great and modern idea to let dirigibles, also known as blimps, dock there. They didn't initially take into account the significant obstacles and engineering struggles that they would soon face. For instance, the builder's plans didn't adequately take into account the immense wind pressure at that altitude or what the stress of the blimp's load would do to the building's structure. As one report noted, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This was a huge structural problem for the architects, and over a million dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to even attempt to handle the strain. Safety was also another big issue, as most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a fire had broken out over a highly populated area such as downtown New York, the results could have been disastrous. The powerful and shifting winds also presented a major problem; even if the blimp was tied down to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around violently and could result in a dangerous accident. There were also existing laws against low flying ships, creating a legal barrier. The architects for the Empire State Building should have thought the entire concept through more carefully before proceeding.
483	15316	6	3	In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders had to fulfill many expectations and make sure everything was right, but while doing that they faced many insurmountable obstacles. The primary obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the complete lack of a suitable and safe landing area in such a dense urban environment. Another critical obstacle the builders faced was that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of the safer helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and they realized how much worse a potential disaster could be especially with a more populated area like downtown New York beneath the mooring mast. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the building's summit were constantly shifting due to violent and unpredictable air currents, making a stable docking procedure nearly impossible. With all of these significant obstacles converging, the builders ultimately realized that this ambitious plan would not work in practice.
484	15317	6	3	The Empire State Building builders faced a couple of fundamental problems with the concept of docking dirigibles to the mooring mast. The dirigible itself presented numerous challenges. While the specific mechanics of a zeppelin are complex, the basic issue of how passengers would safely embark and disembark from the front, or sides, at such a great height was a serious concern. The mast itself was another point of failure. This structure was problematic from the start, as many things could go wrong during a docking attempt. The immense forces involved could potentially damage the building, and components could even fall off unless the engineers did something really special for forging and constructing a building this high. Overall, these problems, along with several others that are equally important, are the primary reason why we don't use zeppelins as much anymore for urban travel.
485	15318	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon Lusted describes how safety, laws, and nature are the three main obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the greatest reason that dirigibles could not be docked in a city like New York. The biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the United States use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. A German dirigible had recently been destroyed in a fire in New Jersey because, as stated, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders of the Empire State building realized that the accident would have been far worse if it had occurred ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" and by docking dirigibles there, they run the risk that it could happen again. Nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were always causing winds to change direction and speed, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" dangerously. They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having heavy weights hanging above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe."" Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge legal obstacle that was impossible to get around. The combined obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it entirely impossible to dock dirigibles to the mooring mast on the building."
486	15319	6	3	The building had a steel framed body up to a certain number of floors with glass windows extending to the 102nd floor. They had to also had to upgrade the building because the stress that gets put on from the blimps would be transmitted through the entire steel structure. This structural reinforcement was necessary to handle the immense forces involved, ensuring the building's integrity and safety under such unique loads. The modifications were a direct and essential response to the anticipated demands of the mooring operation.
487	15320	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by the specified organization, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with several obstacles on they attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could with hold the stress of the dirigible's load. In stanza a particular number the author writes, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to ameliorate this problem. Next, the greatest obstacle they faced was the strong winds on top of the building. In stanza another number, it say, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This arrived as a huge problem as the architects could not weigh down the back of the ship because it could endanger pedestrians. Lastly, in stanza a final number it states there is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Therefore, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building or even come close to the area. Due to these three obstacles the plan of using a mooring mast became an idea of the past, a visionary concept ultimately grounded by practical and legal realities."
488	15321	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public. These combined issues of structural integrity, public safety, and elemental forces rendered the ambitious docking plan unfeasible.
489	15322	6	3	The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below. These fundamental safety and engineering challenges ultimately overshadowed the initial vision for the building's unique function.
490	15323	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by a specified organization, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles also known as blimps to dock there. some of these obstacles faced by the builders were that the architecs could not drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand-foot dirigible to the top of the building's frame ""would add stress to the building's frame."" As noted in paragraph a specific number. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly a specified number of feet below"". Also it was very unsafe allowing the highly flamable dirigible to coast over a highly populated area. Lastly the article states ""the greatest obsticle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The ship would ""swivel"" around the mooring mast. Dirigibles should be landing in open fields, where they could not dangle above pedestrians. The convergence of these structural, safety, and environmental factors meant the dirigible docking concept was never realized."
491	15324	6	3	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock; here are some. First, having something this big land on a twelve hundred foot building would add lots of stress to the building's frame. All of this stress would have to be distributed throughout the eleven hundred foot structure, which was an unthought-of engineering challenge at the time. In order to make the building suitable for all this weight and the dynamic forces involved, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars for the necessary reinforcements, and that was a lot of money, especially considering all the other expenses that they were incurring during the construction. Those were just a few of the significant obstacles they had in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, ultimately contributing to the idea's impracticality.
492	15325	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building ran into some formidable obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Because of all the structural modifications they would need to make in order to have a functioning mooring mast, the project would cost over sixty thousand dollars. It was such an expensive modification because they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the"" flat roof; instead, the entire structure needed to be considered. The immense stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's steel frame during docking and while moored would be too much, and this structural challenge was their primary obstacle. The builders needed to significantly strengthen and modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired, a complex and costly endeavor that proved to be a major hindrance."
493	15326	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly, the idea was just not practical from a safety standpoint. Having an up to a thousand foot blimp full of flammable hydrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew that had a similar disaster happened in New York, the death tolls would be huge. Along with the extreme perils that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting and unpredictable. The air currents were too violent and posed too many threats for a safe operation. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge, making it difficult to control. Lead tools could be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging such heavy weights above tons of people would not be a safe idea either. Overall, the idea of having a dirigible connected to the Empire State Building is just not safe and not worth the catastrophic loss that could potentially occur.
494	15327	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the actual design of the mooring mast and the structural modifications that would have to be made to the building itself. Due to the stress of the wind pressure and the substantial load of the dirigible, the core structure of the building had to be made significantly stronger. The mast would also have to withstand holding down the massive airship with just one cable tether, which would concentrate a lot of stress on a single point of the mast and the building's frame. Another issue faced by the builders was the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States mostly used hydrogen, not the safer helium, in the balloon, which made the vessels more flammable and dangerous. If one ever caught on fire above New York City, it would be a disastrous event. Finally, there was already a law in place that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This existing law made it so that it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to, or even approach, the Empire State Building for docking. In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders were numerous and complex, with most proving too great to overcome when it came to trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the spire of the building.
495	15328	6	3	"There are a few obstacles the builders had to face in this ambitious project. One of them was the intense competition of building the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler Building. The architect of the Chrysler Building secretly made it 46 feet taller with a spire. When this was discovered, the builders needed to make the Empire State Building taller in response, but they wanted to avoid making the addition something ""as mundane as a water tank,"" as Al Smith noted. Another example was trying to make it a stop for dirigibles. These airships could go up to two hundred miles per hour and were as long as one thousand feet. That enormous length would take up several city blocks in New York City, and they simply didn't have a good, clear landing area for something of that scale. A third obstacle they faced was nature itself. The wind was always blowing fiercely at that altitude, creating unstable conditions. No matter what they designed, hanging massive dirigibles over a city of innocent people was recognized as a very dangerous proposition, presenting a risk that was difficult to justify."
496	15329	6	3	While planning this architectural masterpiece, builders faced many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations. The first big problem was the large amounts of stress to the framework of the building when the zeppelins would be moored to the top, also the amount of pull would impact the foundation as well, requiring significant and costly structural reinforcement. The second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework. Safety was a huge issue as well; most blimps are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, also if it were to explode it is floating over one of the largest cities in the country, creating an immense fire risk. With New York's geographical positioning the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly shift directions which could cause the zeppelin to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly too low over highly populated urban cities, rendering the entire concept legally unviable from the start.
497	15330	6	3	Four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. When a dirigible would dock on the mast it would cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame, though at great expense. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densely populated area like New York City, threatening countless lives. Once the mast was built a new problem arose, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the incident with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the balloon since they would be a danger to civilians on the streets below. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the Empire State Building, although two ships got very close, proving the ambition was ultimately impractical.
498	15331	6	3	"This excerpt is talking about the ""The Mooring Mast"" and the construction challenges it presented. One of the obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced is the issue of public safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote reveals that the dirigibles they made is highly flammable and it's dangerous for people's lives. Pretend that the dirigible is on fire while it's flying up high to sky, it causes a catastrophic loss of life over a major city. The other obstacle the builders faced is that the plan was against the law. ""The other reason practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even though the building is the tallest building in New York, it is still too low for the laws. Airship can not fly that low over the urban area, as it would be illegal and cause potential accidents. Furthermore, the Empire State Building is over 1,250 feet, which means on the top of the build has strong and forceful winds and the large dirigibles couldn't stop and get close to the top of the building. ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful wind."" This demonstrated the fundamental environmental challenges that doomed the project."
499	15332	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was the amount of modifications that needed to be made to the building's framework, as stated in the text, which would have required extensive and expensive structural reinforcement to handle the immense loads. The other obstacle they faced was the fact that most countries outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, this made it impossible for dirigibles to stop in a densely populated area such as downtown New York, as stated, due to the unacceptable risk of a fiery disaster. A last obstacle they faced was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, creating a legal barrier that could not be overcome. These are the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, which collectively ensured the mooring mast would never be used for its intended purpose.
500	15333	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"". The swinging of the dirigibles body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support, posing a serious structural risk. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads, a complex engineering challenge. Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast itself. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. The workers had to work for another two months after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders worked hard to suit the new building for the docking of dirigibles, undertaking this additional construction. Unfortunately their work was for nothing, as the mast proved to be impractical and was never successfully used."
501	15334	6	3	"Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building created many obstacles for its builders, some of which weren't even discovered until finally attempting to do it. The first of the builders problems started with trying to prepare the actual building for the added stress that would be applied when having dirigibles try to dock. They spent a considerable sum on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building to handle the immense forces. Then ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower..."" This created lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as made obstacles, complicating the construction process significantly. There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the unpredictable movement of the dirigibles as they attempted to approach. Finally the builders find out the biggest obstacle which is that it is not legal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did. Thinking back on it, it is obvious to see that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."" from the very beginning."
502	15335	6	3	"There were some significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary obstacle was the violent wind currents that made the dirigibles rear swivel dangerously. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This made any docking procedure incredibly hazardous. A second major obstacle was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made the mast nearly useless from a legal standpoint. A third critical obstacle was that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable, posing a grave fire risk. After the dirigible called ""The Hindenburg"" was destroyed in a catastrophic fire, ""the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York."" These combined challenges proved insurmountable for the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
503	15336	6	3	Based on the excerpt The mooring Mast, the primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were fire, wind, and the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. If they let the dirigibles dock there they would risk the dirigibles catching on fire because dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and the Hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a constant danger. Another Obstacle would be the Wind, the winds were shifting because of violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around, and if they put weights on the back it would not be safe for pedestrians on the street below. And the last obstacle would be the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, as it would make it illegal for a Ship to tie to the building. Those were the fundamental obstacles they faced in their ambitious but flawed plan.
504	15337	6	3	"The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was very high among its promoters. The men who built the massive structure should've realized that these expectations were unrealistic from the start. Al Smith had ambitiously planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off or pick up passengers while docked at the building's mast. These plans would never manifest because dirigibles were often powered by hydrogen and it is highly flammable which could result in disaster over the city. Furthermore, the winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong and unpredictable for safe docking. Finally, there was a law prohibiting aircraft from flying so low over urban areas. In one incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the building saw ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]."" It was said that ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mass was nature itself"" because the wind was so strong that dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to dock safely. The law on the altitude of airships wouldn't allow dirigibles to even get close to the building legally. The grand plans for the Empire State Building's mooring mast were never realistic and could never be fullfilled."
505	15338	6	3	The wind was a huge issue when building the empire state building and planning for its dirigible dock. The building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable, subject to powerful and gusty conditions. If they used dirigibles on the Empire State building it would be dangerous because the weights used to stabilize the airships would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads on the streets below. That plan was not smart or safe for the public or for the airship passengers. The primary purpose to build it higher was just so it could be the tallest building in the world, there was really no good practical reasons for it, especially considering the inherent dangers of the docking concept. The entire endeavor was more about prestige than about feasible functionality.
506	15339	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. Safety was a major concern from the outset. To put an extremely heavy object like a dirigible and attach it to just a tether was not safe enough for the building's structure. The combination of combustible gases used in many airships also suggested pulling down a large part of town New York at risk, creating a significant fire hazard. Furthermore, to land on such a small roof would be difficult due to the strong winds present at that great height. Guiding the large and cumbersome dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong, unpredictable gusts. Ultimately, the concept was fraught with complications that made its practical application unfeasible.
507	15340	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the building had a flat roof, and a dirigible moored to the top, only held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame, requiring costly modifications. Other problems the building faced had to do with public safety, as some dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if an accident were to happen in a densely populated area like New York, it would be disastrous. Perhaps the greatest obstacle was nature itself, as the winds at that altitude were constantly shifting and even tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be secured, making the entire operation very unsafe. Consequently, the Empire State Building never succeeded in its intended purpose as a dirigible terminal."
508	15341	6	3	"The main problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that the architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame, as the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle the builders faced was the safety risk exemplified by the German dirigible ""Hindenburg."" With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be fatal in a highly populated area such as downtown New York. Perhaps the greatest obstacle would be nature itself, as the high force winds on top of the Empire State Building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Although the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights would be hanging over pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe for a city environment."
509	15342	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were considerable. They had trouble with the landing area, as one obstacle in their plan was the lack of a suitable and spacious landing zone in New York City. Another obstacle that they had was with the mooring mast's functionality, as the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around uncontrollably. Compounding these issues was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which meant that if they attempted to dock, it would become illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the entire concept impractical from a legal standpoint.
510	15343	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This inherent danger posed an unacceptable risk to the dense urban population of New York City, making the prospect of regular dirigible operations from the skyscraper fundamentally unsafe and ultimately leading to the mast's failure as a functional air terminal.
511	15344	6	3	"In the 1930's, the idea to have a mooring mast mounted on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a very popular theory. However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as existing laws concerning airships, flammable, hydrogen dirigibles, strong winds, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the buildings frame. Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas, creating an immediate legal barrier. The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City, a catastrophic scenario. Strong winds also would be hazardous to dirigibles moored to the empire state building, seeing as the aircrafts couldn't be way down in the air and would be subject to violent gusts. The steel frame of the building would also have to be modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible pulling against its tether. All in all, it was very unrealistic to more dirigibles to the Empire State Building, as it would be unsafe and impractical from every angle."
512	15345	6	3	"Builders faced many obstacles such as safety, nature, flammability and law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mast. The first problem is ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose."" The dirigibles also, use hydrogen not helium, which is very flammable and highly combustible. The Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [it] could have been if it [happened] over densely populated area such as New York, threatening countless lives. The violent air currents also played a role, the back of the ship would swivel around and around, making a stable connection nearly impossible. When dirigibles moored in landing fields they would be weighted down with lead weights, which would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street below the skyscraper. Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, legally prohibiting the entire operation. There was no way dirigibles would be able to dock at the mast safely or legally."
513	15346	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building in New York faced many obstacles while attempting to allowed dirigibles to dock. One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below, a significant engineering challenge. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building, preventing a safe and stable mooring. The building would never be used for its transportational all purpose because of the dangers and obstacles of the mooring mast and dirigibles, rendering the ambitious concept unworkable."
514	15347	6	3	While designing and building the mooring mast atop the Empire State building, the engineers seem to have ignored some seemingly useful information. As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats to a large, lightweight aircraft. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit, and board safely, a process requiring absolute stability. Also if the law itsself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then its game over for the entire venture. Why even bother if its illegal from the start? Although it seems like a futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, to many things, from physics to legislation, prevented the idea from prevailing in reality.
515	15348	6	3	There were many obstacles that the Empire State buildings owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added mooring mast to increase the buildings height and claim the title of world's tallest building. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be expanded in order for there to be more height added to the building, requiring significant structural reinforcement. Altogether this would cost a great deal of money, a substantial financial investment. The main reason, and obstacle was safety for the public and the passengers. The owner had to make sure that the dirigible was not flammable, in which it was, being filled with highly combustible hydrogen gas. Wind and nature also played a big part in deciding to go through with the idea. The strong winds would make the dirigible swing and constantly shift in unpredictable ways. This would make the dirigible hang over people on the streets of New York, which was not safe for those below. The idea that landing dirigibles on top of the empire state building was neither safe or practical, and there were just too many struggles and obstacles for a plan like this to ever follow through successfully.
516	15349	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One thing was just simply the building would not have been strong enough to hold the dirigibles weight. Due to that fact that, they had to strengthen all the framework on the entire building. They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework to ensure it could handle the immense stress. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking, creating a significant safety hazard. Another problem was most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and they didn't want something that could easily catch fire near the building like that, especially in such a densely populated urban area. These combined issues ultimately rendered the ambitious docking plan unworkable.
517	15350	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main reason the dirigibles couldn't dock there was because the dirigibles load. The load would cause stress on the building's structural framework. The wind pressure also is another reason dirigibles couldn't dock there. ""The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" posing a serious engineering challenge. The dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch. The electric winch was fine but, it also says ""the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" this could have been a safety concern also, making a stable and secure connection nearly impossible. Consequently, the practical difficulties proved too great for the plan to succeed."
518	15351	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM1) This shows that docking dirigibles can be harmful as some buildings and many people can be negatively affected. The large business district is too densely populated to allow such a thing. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This obstacle builders faced brought up that lives are yet again in danger, not to mention very expensive damage that allowing dirigibles can cause. Another obstacle builders faced was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) All of these obstacles that the builders faced were very important and paved the way for the idea of dirigibles to be docked attop of the Empire State Building to be disarmed. The dangers involved were too significance and the top of the building now much safer purposes, serving instead as a broadcast antenna."
519	15352	6	3	"There were many problems with the designing of the dirigible docking system. The first of these problems comes from the practicality of the consept. The winds created by the updrafts in the cities are violent and making landing a blimp too risky, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obsticale that was faced was the strutural design. The Empire State Building was not originally designed to moor blimps, and modifying the building to do so was expensive, ""over @NUM1 doolars' worth of modifications,"" to reinforce the structure. The final obsticale was the fact that there were laws in place stopping airships from flying too low over buildings, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These impracticalities prooved to be challenging obsticales that ultimately prevented the system from ever being used as intended."
520	15353	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to use the building to make New York the leader in modern travel. They built a mooring mast which they planned to use to dock dirigibles. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected difficulties and this goal was never accomplished.When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they realized that they would have to redesign the entire building's support structure because of the pressure that a docked dirigible would put on the building. Even after this problem was solved, there were numerous obsticles keeping the goal from being reached.The architects had failed to see many of the potential problems with the mast. Not until after the mast was built did they realized that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable was not a risk that the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock a dirigible.Once these obsticles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible, and the mast was repurposed for other uses.
521	15354	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles during construction, according to the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted. The biggest obstacle of allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there were the forces of nature, such as wind and gravity. As in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air, as the tethered airship could swing violently. Also, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp caused a problem; it was very unsafe to have a possible fire hazard that was several hundred feet long, floating close over a very populated place such as New York City. In addition to that, laws that airships could not fly too close over urban areas prohibited dirigibles even coming close to the mooring mast over the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles proved that it was too dangerous and impractical; the dirigible could not even get close enough to tie up due to the powerful gusts. All in all, the mooring mast over the Empire State Building was a genius idea, but too many obstacles sprung up for it to be in use."
522	15355	6	3	Architects had to face many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The very first problem architects faced was adding a mooring mast to the building because they could not simply just drop one on; they had to go back and re-support the whole skeleton of the building to bear the immense load. Another problem is if the dirigible were to fail like the Hindenburg it would plummet in a ball of fire to a very populated city down below, causing catastrophic damage. The greatest problems architects had to face was nature itself. There were violent winds constantly; if a dirigible had been tethered down it would move violently and go crashing down on pedestrians down below, which is too much of a risk for the architects to take. Ultimately, the combination of structural challenges and safety hazards rendered the concept unworkable.
523	15356	6	3	When attempting to add a mooring mast to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped by the additional stress. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one that could handle the strain. Another obstacle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a dirigible attempting to dock, potentially puncturing its gas-filled envelope. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place involving people on the ground. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a city, which presented a legal barrier. The dirigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be, as these impediments proved too great to overcome.
524	15357	6	3	There were many obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, but the greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were shifting because of violent air currents, creating an unstable environment. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast dangerously. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but this was neither practical nor safe on a skyscraper. The one obstacle to their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, which the mast was intended to solve. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, but the fundamental dangers of wind and instability prevented this vision from becoming a reality.
525	15358	6	3	"There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, an existing law made it so that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which meant that a dirigible could not tie up to the building or approach the area legally. Another problem was making the mast strong enough to support a dirigible, which required significant structural reinforcement. For example, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast and the building's core structure to handle the load. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area like midtown Manhattan. These combined factors ensured the mooring mast would never see practical use."
526	15359	6	3	There were a few significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible is a type of blimp, a giant steel balloon filled with hydrogen or helium. In New York City, dirigibles suffered from a notable lack of suitable landing areas. Al Smith, a four-term governor of New York, proposed a solution by suggesting a mooring mast be added to the Empire State Building's spire. His idea was that this mast would allow dirigibles to anchor securely, refuel, and permit passengers to embark and disembark safely. To realize this plan, the architects and builders had to consult with various experts. They took workers from the @ORGANIZATION2, conducted tests on the mast's design, and met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company to gather technical advice. After navigating all these complex obstacles, they were finally able to construct the mooring mast atop the skyscraper.
527	15360	6	3	"""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted describes the ambitious building of the mast on the Empire State Building. The mast was originally added to ensure the building surpassed the one thousand foot mark. However, Al Smith, one of the project's key figures, wanted the mast to serve a higher purpose by providing a docking station for dirigibles. This innovative idea proved to be very challenging from the start. First, the builders had to fundamentally change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the immense weight of a dirigible swaying in the high winds. L¸sted writes that ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" to ensure stability. When the mast was finally built, the builders then faced the terrifying problem of having the massive airships dangling high above pedestrians on the street; if one ever fell, hundreds of people could be killed. Finally, there was an existing law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which meant that by docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Although it was a visionary idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" effectively shows that it ultimately would not be practically possible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."
528	15361	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex obstacles in their plan to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the paramount concern at each stage of consideration. The recent and catastrophic explosion of the Hindenburg vividly illustrated the potential dangers involved in docking these hydrogen-filled aircraft. If a blimp were to explode in the densely populated downtown New York area, it could result in an unprecedented disaster. Another significant obstacle was the force of nature itself. The winds at the top of the towering building were notoriously strong and constantly changing. This unpredictable wind pattern atop the skyscraper made the idea of mooring a massive zeppelin there very illogical and hazardous. Furthermore, at this time, new laws against flying low in urban areas were being introduced, which would make docking the airships at such a location illegal. The idea of making the Empire State Building a mooring post was certainly an impressive engineering feat, but the actual usage of it for this purpose was ultimately not a practical or safe endeavor.
529	15362	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were primarily structural. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add tremendous stress to the building's steel frame. Also, the combined stress of the dirigible's heavy load and the powerful wind pressure would have to be transmitted and managed. This immense force would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, which was located nearly eleven hundred feet below the mast. Consequently, the entire steel frame of the building would have to be modified and significantly strengthened to handle these loads. This necessary structural reinforcement would be a costly undertaking, amounting to over sixty thousand dollars in additional expenses for the project.
530	15363	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were really difficult. The workers had to make sure that the building was not so tall that it would tilt or become unstable, a major engineering concern for such a massive structure. The workers also faced intense competition from other skyscrapers being constructed at the time. They needed their building to be the biggest, and they didn't give up until their building was officially the tallest building in @CAPS1, achieving their goal and securing a place in history.
531	15364	6	3	Builders trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building faced significant problems. The dirigible's weight and the wind pressure would add considerable stress to the building's structure, which had to be transmitted more than @NUM1 ft down to the buildings foundation to ensure stability. Construction, however, wasn't the only problem. Most @CAPS2-American dirigibles are held afloat by helium, which is extremely flammable, and if a ship was @CAPS3 over the busy and crowded New York streets, many people could have been killed in a potential disaster. Nature added further to the problems, as unpredictable wind currents had the potential to push dirigibles into @CAPS4 buildings, causing them to pop and deflate. The final problem was that @CAPS5 regulations were already in place, which didn't allow low flying aircrafts over the city. Ultimately, builders faced insurmountable problems with nature, @CAPS5, public safety, and construction engineering, which collectively lead to the demise of the use of the mooring system.
532	15365	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new financial investments would have to include more money for structural reinforcements. Anything done to the top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation to handle the additional loads. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" to achieve this. Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the @DATE1 ft. building, which could easily destabilize an airship. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring mast, the back would be left to sway dangerously in the wind, posing a significant hazard. Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results, risking many lives. In conclusion, the numerous risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building clearly outweighed the potential rewards, and when dirigible travel became less practical, the ambitious plan was scrapped completely."
533	15366	6	3	Many obstacles were encountered while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. This was a long, hard, and carefully thought out process. Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof without considering the immense forces involved. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, for instance, was to be held by a single cable tether, which added significant stress to the buildings frame and required careful engineering. The architects also had to build a specially designed shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building for both aesthetic and functional reasons. Later on, they realized dirigibles could not practically moor at the Empire State building. One primary reason was a specific law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier. Architects thus went through many complex obstacles in their attempt to build functional masts, but these challenges ultimately proved too great.
534	15367	6	3	"Problems the builders of the Empire State Building came across were some tricky, life threatening ones. The first, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, was the grave danger of fire. It explains that if a dirigible was to try and dock and something went wrong causing it to catch on fire, there would be serious damage done to the people below on the streets, leading to potential fatalities. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was the ""greatest obstacle"" described in paragraph @NUM2, which was the fact that the wind at the top of the tower would be whipping the dirigible around with just a single cable holding it to the mooring mast. This situation was not making it safe for anyone around the building or in the blimp, as a breakaway could be catastrophic. One other reason the builders had to figure out when building the mast, was that no airships flying low could enter the area, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM3, due to existing aviation restrictions. Those are some of the critical problems the builders had to face and overcome if they wished to successfully dock dirigibles on the building, though many remained unresolved."
535	15368	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author explains the Empire State building's past construction which led it to be the tallest building in the United States. Although the builder Al Smith had many obstacles, they faced one of the hardest ones when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was the practicality of allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on safely. Another obstacle was the technical challenge of letting dirigibles dock because they needed a secure place to tie up to a mast. It is stated, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast"" (L¸sted @NUM1). This can be a significant problem because the body of the massive airship could swing dangerously in a lot of breeze, making the procedure unstable. Although there were many such obstacles, Al Smith worked his way around them and proceeded to finish the Empire State building with the courage to take on all challenges, even if the dirigible docking concept was not ultimately successful."
536	15369	6	3	"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that prevented the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. Despite the readiness of then- @CAPS1 Al Smith, who publicly announced the plan, and of John Tauranac, who reported that the top of the Empire State Building ""would serve a higher calling [than] to add a desired few feet,"" @ORGANIZATION2 contends that the failure of the mast ""should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"". According to the article, the mast, and a moored dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" a force that would need to be channeled down to its foundation. More than sixty thousand dollars was spent to accommodate the pressure and strengthen the structure. Chemically, foreign dirigibles also contained hydrogen, which was more flammable than American-used helium, creating a significant fire risk. An explosion above the Empire State Building would be devastating to the city. Furthermore, an existing law prevented dirigibles from ""even approach[ing]"" the building, legally prohibiting the plan. @ORGANIZATION2 uses these reasons to detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast, concluding that the project was fundamentally flawed from its inception."
537	15370	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were difficult and ultimately insurmountable. One of the obstacles they faced was fixing the Empire State Building's structure to handle the immense strain, and the cost for this was prohibitively high. For example, in the excerpt it said ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The plan never fully went through because public safety was a primary issue that could not be ignored. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets from a potential disaster was a big risk they could not take. It was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, creating a legal blockade. The obstacles that the builders had to face, from structural and financial to safety and legal, made the ambitious idea impossible to happen in reality."
538	15371	6	3	The architects had few problems with the initial design of the building itself, but the plan for a dirigible mooring mast presented significant challenges. As said in @LOCATION1, the stress from the Dirigibles Load was too much for the building's existing frame to bear safely. They would require over sixty thousand Dollars of modifications to reinforce the steel structure. Other than that, they @CAPS2 had to redesign the mast and its integration with the building and then make it functional, a process that proved to be both complex and costly. These unforeseen requirements highlighted the impracticality of the original mooring mast concept, leading to its eventual abandonment as a feasible project.
539	15372	6	3	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast,"" there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the combined force of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure on the building's foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" @CAPS1, this was a big obstacle for the landing process of the dirigibles, requiring extensive and expensive structural changes. Another problem they had was that dirigibles use hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it had caught fire, it would not have been good for a populated city. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill it's purpose. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If the dirigible caught the building on fire, many people's lives would be in complete danger. In conclusion, the Mooring Mast did not work out for many reasons, but safety concerns regarding the flammable gas and the immense dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation were two big obstacles for allowing dirigibles to dock."
540	15373	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the tragic fate of the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily, making a safe connection unfeasible. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications."" These combined factors ensured the mooring mast remained an architectural novelty rather than a functional port."
541	15374	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders had to face many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading selection The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted it discusses many of the difficulties that were faced. For an example an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City, which was densely packed with buildings. The second challenge they faced was how to make dirigible's travel global so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company who would use the dirigible's service across the pacific ocean. The architects also had meetings with the government about safe ways of mooring airships to this mast, seeking official approval and guidance. The builders went through many challenges to use the dirigibles but eventually it wasn't enough to put the plan into effect, and the ambitious idea was ultimately abandoned.
542	15375	6	3	"One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how to do it safely. According to the reading, it says that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" posing a significant fire risk. Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" located at the beginning of the paragraph, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe and unpredictable. Last but not least, another reason why dirigibles could not dock was because it was illegal. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Because of that law, it would make it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area, creating a legal barrier. Therefore it would be impossible for a ship to land there, sealing the fate of the project."
543	15376	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in the text, the author mentions that they had to consider the Hindenburg incident that took place on May 6, 1937. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" says the author. They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios, making them reconsider the risks. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. In another paragraph, the author says: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Typically dirigibles are often docked in open fields, where weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely. But above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation and an obvious danger. The builders had many obstacles in designing the use of the mooring mast, which ultimately prevented its practical application."
544	15377	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The thousand foot dirigible on top the Empire State building could add significant stress to the building's frame, which was a major structural concern. The stress from the dirigible was way too much to carry, and the frame of the building would have to have been modified and strengthened to be able to hold the dirigible's immense weight and the forces from wind. There were many risks taken by landing a dirigible atop the Empire State Building, and these structural challenges proved to be a fundamental obstacle to the plan's feasibility.
545	15378	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add tremendous stress to the frame. The obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger to withstand these new forces. In the text it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger, noting that ""the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and ""The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners"" to provide additional structural integrity. Other obstacles they went through was making sure the mooring mast was tall enough for the massive airships, and in another part of the text Smith says, ""people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast,"" indicating ongoing consultations to resolve these complex issues. Despite these efforts, the practical and safety obstacles ultimately prevented the dirigible docking plan from becoming a reality."
546	15379	6	3	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few significant challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be fundamentally altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly and a major engineering hurdle. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings due to the inherent dangers involved. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it, rendering the docking plan effectively impossible from a legal standpoint. These combined structural and legal issues ultimately prevented the ambitious dirigible docking plan from becoming a reality."
547	15380	6	3	"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety, a paramount concern. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fiery catastrophe, they realized that it would have been much worse over a highly populated city like New York. Another problem was nature and the unpredictable weather conditions. Winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making a stable and safe docking procedure nearly impossible. The third problem was that there was a law in place prohibiting such maneuvers. As L¸sted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This regulation meant the building would have to be much taller in order for the ships to even approach it legally, a feat that was not feasible. Consequently, these three critical obstacles proved insurmountable for the dirigible docking concept."
548	15381	6	3	Building a big piece of work is not easy and involves overcoming numerous difficulties. You have to fix the negatives and do everything correctly to ensure a successful outcome. You never know at times you have to tear things down for hard work to be completed right, which requires patience and resilience. When looking at you did right things to prevent bad things from occurring, you see the importance of careful planning. You may face a whole bunch of unforeseen challenges when building. The Empire State Building faced particular attemps one allowed to dock when building the dirigibles to the dock was not performed or built right, highlighting the complexities of such an ambitious project. Even though said, swinging to climb on as build pressure by the forces involved. Although, Building things is hard, it is also a rewarding process. You get the beauty and hardship out of it, appreciating the final result. It helps you reminded of your wells done correctly and the effort that went into the creation, serving as a lasting testament to the endeavor.
549	15382	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building faced many complex problems in attempting the dirigibles to dock there. Some of the most apparant reasons were because of what the dirigibles were made out of, the challenging weather conditions, and existing laws about airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not made out of the safest materials, most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flamible and poses a great risk. This would make the docking Station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire, creating a major hazard. If the dirigible were to ever get caught on fire, the accident would be very severe, since the Station would be over a densely populated area, endangering thousands. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the violent air currents atop the empire state building, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe and unstable to dock there. If something happened to the dirigible, it would be unsafe for the many pedestrians below it on the city streets. The last reason for the docking station not being built is in paragraph @NUM2 because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It would be illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station because of this law, which presented a legal barrier. This law is because of the high winds, fearing that they would blow the dirigible onto other buildings, causing further damage. The docking station was ultimately unable to be built because of these critical safty reasons and the existing laws that governed air travel."
550	15383	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced a multitude of problems as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety concerns and the practical difficulties of actually mooring the dirigible itself. The hydrogen used within the dirigible was highly unsafe, as hydrogen is very flammable and volatile. If the hydrogen caught on fire, especially over a place as densely populated as New York City, many people would be harmed in a catastrophic event. Additionally, the builders were faced with the complex task of mooring the massive dirigible. Dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights, which was a standard procedure. However, if one used those weights to anchor the dirigible above city streets, pedestrians below could potentially be injured by a falling object or a malfunction. Actually allowing the dirigible to dock brought up another problem for the builders to address: if the dirigible was tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swings around and around the mast due to powerful wind currents. Ultimately, the builders were unable to address these significant issues and the Empire State Building is now used mainly as an observation deck and office building, its intended function for airships never realized.
551	15384	6	3	"Docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is a feat that will most likely never be accomplished. The main overall concern with allowing this is safety. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects realized the accident would have been even more catastrophic, had it taken place over a densely populated city like New York. Nature also played a significant role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2), which made stable mooring nearly impossible. The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast, and trying to weigh it down securely ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work was that a law was passed; a law that specifically prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over any urban area. This meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast at all. These architects had very little working for them and almost everything working against them, ultimately dooming the ambitious plan to failure."
552	15385	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a hard task on their hands. They were building the tallest building in the world, and when Al Smith, the head in the construction of the building, said to make it taller, things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't know is that it is a little more difficult than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. The architects would have to modify the building's structure because a thousand-foot dirigible moored on the building would add immense stress to the building's frame. Furthermore, dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable; if it were to catch on fire in downtown New York, it would be disastrous. Nature poses a threat as well, as the powerful winds on top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivel around uncontrollably. The final obstacle is that there is a law that prohibits airships from flying too low in urban areas. In the end, the plan failed due to these insurmountable challenges.
553	15386	6	3	They @CAPS1 A alot problem with people @CAPS2 about Airship on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 with the @ORGANIZATION1, as the public expressed significant concerns over the safety and feasibility of the proposed docking maneuvers. The inherent risks involved created a great deal of apprehension and debate among officials and citizens alike, ultimately contributing to the project's difficulties and its eventual abandonment.
554	15387	6	3	"Al Smith and the engineers faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles used hydrogen; hydrogen is a very flammable chemical, and this could have led to the Empire State Building burning down and killing millions. Another obstacle they faced was mother nature; at a height like 1,250 ft, there are incredible winds blowing, and sometimes even unexpected, they can blow the dirigible into the building, causing it to be fatal. Finally, the law prohibits the dirigible from ""flying too low over urban areas,"" therefore doing this would be illegal. The building faced many obstacles, and it got through most of them, but in the end, it would be extremely unsafe to go on with the mast, leading to the termination of the idea."
555	15388	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author @ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They were going to attach a single cable tether, but it would add significant stress to the buildings frame. They had to make the frame of the building stronger, for which they designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. When they tried it, the wind was too strong, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel wildly around the mooring mast, making a secure connection impossible. They also couldn't do it because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prevented the operation from ever beginning.
556	15389	6	3	There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One problem is that if they were to tie a single cable tether to the building and the blimp, then it would add significant stress to the building's frame. The immense stress of the blimp's load, combined with the force of wind pressure, had to have been sent all the way to the base of the building, which was a considerable distance below. Another problem that arose later was that other blimps outside the United States were made with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Now since the German blimp, the Hindenburg, blew up by fire, architects are worried that it will be a bad idea to do this because if it happened over a densely populated city then many more lives would be in danger. Also, yet another obstacle came up due to nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear end of the blimp would be all over the place, making a stable connection nearly impossible. That is why now, blimps dock on the ground and are held down by weights on multiple sides for greater stability. One other reason that this is a problem is that docking a blimp at the Empire State Building would be illegal due to the case that it is flying too low to the ground, violating aviation regulations. This law also makes it explicitly illegal for the blimp to dock on to the building, rendering the initial concept impractical from a legal standpoint.
557	15390	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders had to take into account for the dirigible docking plan. One primary obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be significantly modified because the dirigible's substantial load and the powerful wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, posing a serious structural risk. To address this critical issue, they had to pay over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications into the building's framework, a costly endeavor that ultimately proved to be just one of several insurmountable challenges facing the ambitious project.
558	15391	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to figure out a way for the dirigibles to attach to the Empire State Building, in order for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off"". The builders also had to figure out a way to securely attach the mooring mast to the top of the building. According to the text, with a dirigible attached by only a single wire to the building, more stress would be added to the building's frame so they could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the building without considering the structural implications. Also because of this, the builders had to edit the foundation extensively, so it would not collapse if a dirigible was attached and subjected to various forces. Finally, the builders needed to overcome the simple nature of the environment; they did not anticipate that the winds on top of the building were shifting constantly, and they are in a densely populated city so if things went wrong, many people could be harmed, adding a layer of public safety concerns to the engineering difficulties."
559	15392	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by the referenced organization, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were very difficult, and in my understanding, the endeavor was not successful. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts of the naval air station; the navy leader offered its dirigible to be used in testing the mast. In figuring out if it was okay for the mast to be used, architects realized they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the structure because it would cause dangerous stress to the building's frame, requiring a complete reassessment of the plan. Also, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, as the fundamental concept was flawed from the start. It wasn't safe enough, and because those dirigibles that come from outside the country don't always use helium but instead use hydrogen, which is highly flammable, it was considered a bad idea to have such a hazard in the heart of downtown New York, leading to the eventual abandonment of the project."
560	15393	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Though this idea was not successful, it took them a long time to realize the various causes and effects of docking dirigibles at such a great height. Over sixty thousand dollars were spent on modifications for the building's structure to handle the anticipated loads. However, after fixing the structure of the building, the builders found out that the weather had interfered with the plan. Because of the high winds at that altitude, the dirigibles were constantly shifting and could not be stabilized. There wasn't a safe or reliable way to control this constant shifting, making the operation too risky. There was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities, which presented a legal barrier. Another significant reason was that dirigibles were very dangerous and highly flammable, representing a major fire hazard. Ultimately, trying to build a functioning mooring mast was not a good idea, and the concept was ultimately deemed unworkable."
561	15394	6	3	"The architects of late 1920s and 1930s New York had ambitious plans to revolutionize urban air travel, and put New York at the forefront of modern travel. However, their wild ideas fell short when confronted with reality. In an attempt to outstrip the Chrysler Building, architect Al Smith added an unsecure mast to the top of the Empire State Building. The place where blimps, or dirigibles, could let on and off passengers and refuel, had received more hype than serious engineering study. The biggest obstacle the builders faced was passenger and public safety. Since most blimps outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, they were very flammable. If the German blimp ""Hindenburg"" had blown up above a more densely populated area than New Jersey, such as New York, the results would have been far more devastating. As one paragraph states, even if the mast were a technical success, the weather would prove to be a fatal flaw. Even if the ship were tethered to the mast, it would still swivel around dangerously. The U.S. Navy tried to tie up next to the mast—before a law was passed not allowing aircraft to fly so low—but the wind made their efforts futile. The architects of the 1920s and 1930s were thinking big, but some obstacles were simply too big to leap."
562	15395	6	3	When the idea of creating a mooring post for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building was conceived, there were several critical problems the engineers failed to properly recognize. The first was the inherent problem of using highly flammable hydrogen gas to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident tragically showed how horrible the consequences are when one of these airships explodes. The situation would have been much worse had such a disaster occurred over a thousand stories in the air above a city. Secondly, violent wind gusts at that altitude would have made it nearly impossible to dock the dirigible atop the building safely, especially when the use of customary lead weights for stabilization would be both unsafe and not practical for an urban environment. Lastly, there was a law imposed before this project was ever a serious thought, making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area, which ultimately rendered the entire concept illegal from the start.
563	15396	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the significant problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming intensely competitive in the race to build the tallest building, and that ambition was blinding him to the potential risks. The people who wanted to progress the transportation of their time had not fully analyzed the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in the early progression of the mast, it was clear this ambitious plan may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of the 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be a devastation to happen above the densely populated Downtown New York. Another obstacle, as said in another paragraph, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible swiveling around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fulfilled its destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes."
564	15397	6	3	"The builders and designers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. The first, and most apparent one, was the structural frame of the building itself. The article says, ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the building's flat roof"". The thousand-foot tower would add extra strain on the building's frame, requiring a significant and costly redesign. Next was the pressing question of public safety. Most international dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very dangerous gas, and if set on fire will make a huge explosion, as tragically exemplified by the German dirigible the Hindenburg. If that same accident took place over New York City, many pedestrians on the streets below would be hurt or killed. Also, the wind played a huge role as an obstacle. The winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and therefore the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" which would be extremely unsafe for any attempted docking or passenger transfer. Lastly, and most simply, the law didn't allow for an airship to fly that low over urban areas. All of these obstacles put together caused the grand idea of using the building as a docking tower to fail."
565	15398	6	3	"There would have been many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building would have had to face if they decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On a fateful day, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners realized how much worse it would have been had such a disaster occurred in a place such as New York City. Another big obstacle would have been nature itself. ""The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast the back of the ship would move around, making it hard and dangerous for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead weight then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging precariously over the pedestrians of New York City. The final obstacle that builders would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of the building. They would not even be allowed to approach it, sealing the fate of this futuristic vision."
566	15399	6	3	"The Empire State Building is one of the tallest buildings ever built, and it was precisely because of this great height that it was ultimately impossible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. The article by the Port Authority titled ""The Mooring Mast"" describes well the fundamental problem blimps may have encountered. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" It's true, should a blimp try to moor there it would do nothing but twirl around the mast uncontrollably. It could also crash into other nearby buildings, or the force of the winds could tear up the mooring mast structure itself. There was so much about the atmospheric conditions and practical aerodynamics that the builders didn't fully look into before proceeding with the plan."
567	15400	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building. The first obstacle realized was the critical safety issues involved. Most dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable and posed a great fire risk. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The wind currents at the top of the building were sporadic and unpredictable, and that could be a huge problem for the large, slow-moving dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that the builders never initially realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the Empire State Building was still too low for an aircraft of any sort to legally dock on, as it could be a danger to the urban areas and the people underneath. Those were the main obstacles which collectively caused the ambitious mooring mast project to fail.
568	15401	6	3	The builders didn't have a suitable landing area for the Dirigible, and if the Dirigible were to land on the Empire State Building's flat roof, its immense weight would add significant stress to the building's structural integrity. Money was one of the big financial issues the builders faced in creating a feasible docking solution. In paragraph five it's saying that the greatest obstacle was nature; the heavy winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air current. This meant the Dirigible itself would be forced to swivel around the mooring mast, creating a hazard for the airship and for the safety of the people on board as well as on the ground. Another obstacle was the law, as regulations stated that flying too low over urban areas were not allowed for safety reasons, making the entire concept legally unworkable from the start.
569	15402	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were considerable; they needed to build a structure with a stable enough top to be able to hold a massive dirigible. Once the Chrysler Building became taller than the Empire State Building, however, the original idea of using the mast for dirigibles slowly faded away, largely unnoticed by the public. For example, in paragraph three, Al Smith said he would put a top or hat on the building to make it taller and reclaim the title. The only problem is that instead of dirigibles docking there securely, they would likely just sit next to the point of the building, unable to properly land. If Smith wasn't so competitive in the race for height, the blimps might have had a nice, functional platform to dock on, but the focus shifted solely to winning that race.
570	15403	6	3	In constructing and building the Empire State Building to make it allowable for dirigibles to dock there took a lot of thinking on the builders' part. First they had to see what the building structure could handle and try to calculate what weight it held so it wouldn't fall or become unstable. Then they had to figure out the safety of the passengers arriving by airship and the pedestrians below, devising a way to get people in and out of the dirigible as safe and easy as possible. Despite all the work the builders' put into crafting Al Smith's grand idea, the chances of it working safely just weren't realistic at all to the public and to aviation experts, and the plan had to be shut down. Although it makes a good story and is a crucial learning block for constructors to be more pragmatic in their future ambitious designs.
571	15404	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first problems they faced was not being able to land. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This was a major problem because they had nowhere to land this object; this cannot modernize their traveling. The dense urban landscape of New York City simply offered no open ground for such large airships. Another problem that the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This caused a problem because how were dirigibles from other countries visit us if they caused a threat to the safety of the people. They were not going to take that risk. A third problem was nature and the weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) The blimps had a very unsteady landing The winds would thrash them around. This was very unsafe @CAPS5 thats why it became an obsticale for the builders. Ultimately, these combined issues proved too difficult to overcome for regular dirigible operations."
572	15405	6	3	The obstacles that builders faced at the empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there are. The possible dangers of having something fall on them. The hydrogen is highley flamable so the dirigible could blow up and ingor any one aroud it. A catastrophic fire could rain debris down onto the streets below. The empire state building may not be strong enough to withstand the the moving of the @CAPS1 the back side moveing so much from the dangorouse winds, so the @CAPS1 could possibly pull off part of the building and could @CAPS2 nearby pedastrians. The structural strain from a massive, tethered airship being buffeted by gusts was a serious concern for engineers. These significant safety risks ultimately made the plan impractical.
573	15406	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Is that when the Empire State Building was conceived, it was Planned as the world's tallest building. Then the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second Street and @CAPS1 Avenue in new york surpassed it. Before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip his rival. This competition for height and prestige was a driving force behind the ambitious plan for dirigibles or zeppelin and the @ORGANIZATION2 was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking. However, the practical challenges of actually docking an airship at such a great height were not fully considered in this race to the top.
574	15407	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of those obstacles was that there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City, which made a skyscraper mooring seem like an innovative solution. Another obstacle was that the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame, requiring significant structural reinforcement. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. Wind on top of the building shift constantly caused by violent air currents. The back of the ship with swivel around the mooring mast while it was tethered, making the docking process perilous and uncontrollable. These fundamental issues prevented the concept from becoming a practical reality.
575	15408	6	3	"Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building: one obstacle the builders encountered was the fact that when a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, it would add to much stress to the buildings framework because of a combination of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure atop the massive @DATE1 foot structure. To solve this, the build had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 with these two reasons, there was already a law against airships height in urban areas and by talking a dirigible at the building would break it. As seen by this paragraph there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, and the inherent dangers and logistical nightmares ultimately led to the abandonment of the plan."
576	15409	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @PERSON1, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. First of all, they needed a suitable landing area, which was a Mooring Mast. But before building the mast, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Workers framed the structure all the way up to the 85th floor, but before the framing for the mast could take place, the roof had to be completed. Before advancing to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disastrous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" disaster set a good example on why they couldn't do it, highlighting the extreme dangers involved. The area around the building was too densely populated, and the dirigible had a strong chance of resulting in a catastrophe over New York City, considering the violent and unpredictable air currents. The project was simply too risky, but it was nevertheless a great idea involving future transportation that was ultimately ahead of its time."
577	15410	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem was safety. When the front of the airship was masted to the building, the back would move around uncontrollably, creating a significant hazard. Another big problem was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed a severe fire risk. Also, it was illegal for airships to fly that low over densely packed urban areas due to existing aviation regulations. Another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of powerful wind gusts that made stable approach and docking maneuvers impossible. These combined factors ultimately prevented the ambitious plan from becoming a practical reality.
578	15411	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered major obstacles. The first puzzle posed to the builders concerned the structure itself. They realized that, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted... to the building's foundation."" This structural reality caused builders to spend over @MONEY1 modifying and reinforcing the building's steel framework. Although the builders were able to rectify the framework of the building, the later obstacles were unable to be conquered. After the Hindenburg accident in 1937 ""the owners of the Empire @CAPS1 Building realized how much worse that accident could have been"" if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the entire city became a paramount concern. Until the blimps were less flammable, it wasn't plausible to take the risk of housing them in densely populated areas. The final obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was ""nature itself."" The violent winds that whipped around the 101st and 102nd floors would spin the dirigibles around the mooring mast. This was ""neither practical or safe."" Overall, the obstacles the builders faced proved to be fatal to the success of the mooring mast, rendering the concept unworkable."
579	15412	6	3	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof because it would add significant stressing to the building's frames, potentially compromising its integrity. So they had to modify the building's frames extensively to strengthen them for this new purpose. Also, most dirigibles of the era used hydrogen for lift, which is highly flammable and could destroy a large population of New York if an accident occurred. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself. The winds at that altitude constantly shifted, and the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it unsafe for the pedestrians and traffic below. Finally, another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building was because there was a specific law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making the entire operation illegal.
580	15413	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the @CAPS1 faced huge obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. First, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The reason for that is because the ""winds atop the building were always changing due to the violent air currents"" found at such a high altitude. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered, it would swivel around"" the mast uncontrollably. ""Also, it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street; it was not practical nor safe."" It would be really dangerous if they proceeded with docking atop of the building, risking a catastrophic fall or collision. Those are the significant obstacles the builders faced in their ambitious but ultimately flawed plan."
581	15414	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacles was that the building with a mooring mast on the top of it attached by one cable to a dirigible ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" This was a significant concern as the immense force exerted by a floating airship, especially during windy conditions, would place a tremendous and unexpected load on the steel skeleton. Another obstacle was to fix the buildings structure so it could with stand the mast, which required substantial and costly modifications to the underlying support system. These foundational challenges, rooted in the fundamental physics of anchoring a massive, buoyant object to a stationary skyscraper, ultimately proved to be major impediments to the project's feasibility, highlighting the immense difficulty of the endeavor."
582	15415	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the author described the obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He imagined the top of the Building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. It seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. The first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in New York City. They would have to clear about four blocks in the bussy city, a logistical and financial nightmare of property acquisition and demolition. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework to even attempt to support the envisioned mast. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor. In the end, The greatest Obstacle was just nature itself, with its unpredictable and powerful winds making the proposed docking maneuvers perilously unstable and impractical."
583	15416	6	3	"A @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the empire state building didn't seem so @CAPS1-@CAPS2 in 1929. Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand foot building, problems quickly presented themselves The first problem architecs ran into was the construction of the building itself. The empire state building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building, threatening its structural integrity. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable was the Idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are a uncontrolable force of nature, especially when a thousand feet off the ground. Even if tethered, a dirigible would swivel @CAPS1 too much to be considered safe. The idea presented itself to be inconceivable. A mast was put atop the Empire State building, and the 102nd floor does, in fact, exist. Both of these building's features are out of use, proving to be unsafe to the public and standing as a monument to an ambitious but ultimately unworkable vision."
584	15417	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort, requiring significant financial investment and engineering revisions. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan, creating an unacceptable risk of a catastrophic fire in the heart of the city. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue, making it nearly impossible to safely secure a large, buoyant airship. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful, rendering the ambitious concept impractical."
585	15418	6	3	There were many obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. One of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety. Most of the foreign dirigibles ran on hydrogen and the builders did not want to risk another Hindenburg accident in the highly populated New York City, a fear that was both prudent and widespread. Nature also restricted the building of a dock. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, another threat that the builders did not want to risk, as it made stable docking a near impossibility. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier that further complicated the plan. There were many reasons why the mast was never constructed including safety issues, nature, and an existing law that prohibited low air travel over the city. In the end however, the building of a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe, and the project was eventually dropped, leaving the mast as a largely decorative feature.
586	15419	6	3	"Mooring dirigibles would not be good at all if they were being moored on top of the Empire State Building. One of the primary reasons that mooring a dirigible on the top of the building is problematic is that most dirigibles that would come to this dock from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The hydrogen is extremely flammable and after the Hindenburg exploded, it would be far too unsafe to have a hydrogen filled dirigibles in a highly populated area such as New York City. Another significant obstacle that was being faced was a climate problem, which was arguably the biggest problem. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" (paragraph @NUM1). If the winds were this rapid the back of the dirigible would be swinging around freely. This could potentially cause immense danger if the back was to hit a building near by or start swinging out of control and break loose from the building, creating a hazard for the entire city below. The last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law. The exsisting law stated that an airship couldn't fly to low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock at the Empire State Building, it would be too low over an urban area, directly violating this regulation. This combination of safety, environmental, and legal issues made it ultimately impossible for the Empire State Building to have a functional dock for dirigibles."
587	15420	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were hard because they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the structure due to the existing frame work. The immense stress of the dirigible's load and the powerful wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would also have to be extensively modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate this new situation and the unique forces involved. And over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications have to be made to the building's framework to achieve this necessary reinforcement. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from sides, with a steps-back design that imitated over all shape of the building itself. This capital rocket-shape mast would have four wings at its corners, made of shiny-aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm, a design intended to be both functional and iconic despite the underlying structural challenges.
588	15421	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, the author says ""The greatest reason was one of safety"". The dirigible used hydrogen that was highly flameable and they could not risk a catastrophic fire in such a densely populated area. Another considerable obstacle was the wind and nature itself. In the excerpt it said ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents"" This created another safety problem, as the unpredictable gusts made stable docking nearly impossible. The wind would sway the dirigible back and forth, and if they used weights to weigh the back down, it would be dangerous hanging above pedestrians walking on the streets below. The author explained how ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" This being because the entire concept was just not practical nor safe given the technological and environmental limitations of the time, leading to the mast's eventual obsolescence."
589	15422	6	3	"The problems the builders had in attempting to build the Empire State Building were first of all, the dirigible would have to be tied to the mast and the single cable tether would ""stress the buildings frame."" In paragraph @NUM1, the author says that the wind pressure and the weight of the dirigible could not be supported by the current foundation and so the frame would have to be made stronger and changed to handle the additional dynamic loads. The final problem was when ""Columbia"" delivered newspaper to the Empire State building in a publicity stunt. The mooring equipment was not installed because of previous problems with the design, laws and common sense used when making this building, highlighting the impracticality of the original plan. The rest of the problems had to do with the obliviousness of reality due to the actual effectivness of the building, as the visionary idea ultimately clashed with practical engineering and urban safety concerns, rendering the mooring mast an architectural novelty."
590	15423	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a major safety concern for the city's inhabitants. Marcia L¸sted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered in a disaster similar to the Hindenburg. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add significant stress to the building's frame so steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened at great cost, a necessary but ultimately futile preparation for a function that would never be realized."
591	15424	6	3	"The architects who made the Mooring mast faced many obstacles when trying to get dirigibles to dock. Some were safety concerns, nature itself, and pre existing laws. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This created a significant fire risk, especially in a populated area like New York City. The greatest obstacle was nature. Winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash to the mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. An existing law prevented airships to fly too low in urban cities, adding another layer of difficulty to the docking procedure. For all the work the architects put into the mast it could never live up to its potential, ultimately remaining an unused feature."
592	15425	6	3	The Empire State building was not a good place to attach a blimp to. One reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues. In every country except the United States, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area due to the catastrophic potential of an explosion. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back, a complex maneuver at such a great altitude. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas, which dictated a minimum altitude for aircraft. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans for a functional docking system. Even after thousands of dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished for its intended role as an airship terminal.
593	15426	6	3	The challenge that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there is that they simply can't throw on a top part to the building, they have to put it on piece by piece, or the building will become stressed to the point where it might collapse. This structural consideration was paramount, as the mooring mast needed to be integrated into the building's core support system to handle the immense forces imposed by a docked airship. Simply adding the mast as an afterthought was not a feasible option from an engineering perspective. The structural integrity of the entire skyscraper depended on this careful, methodical construction process for the mast.
594	15427	6	3	"The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builder's decided to construct the mast they knew that it could not just be placed on the roof. It had to be somehow attached to the foundation of the building because the dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" requiring a robust structural integration. Also, after the Hindenburg disaster the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible ""is highly flammable,"" presenting a grave danger. If a dirigible were to explode over New York City it would not only kill the people in the dirigible, but on the ground as well, creating an unacceptable public safety hazard. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast ""was nature itself."" The wind at the top of the building are very strong and would have swiveled around the mast, making a secure and stable docking procedure virtually impossible to achieve. The many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any dirigibles to land there, rendering the mast an architectural novelty."
595	15428	6	3	"When building a great task, many obstacles need to be faced. For the builders of the Empire State Building it was ones concerning the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. One was safety. The builders had to make sure it was safe to dock on and off the blimp, and it was safe to fly. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" People wouldn't be safe on a blimp that could expload at any moment, especially one hovering over a major metropolitan center. Another obstacle the builders had to face was building the mooring mast itself for docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The blimp wouldn't be able to hold correctaly to the mast and it would move around too much, posing a risk to both the airship and the building. It wasn't safe or practical for anyone involved in the operation. These are some obstacles many builders have to face, but the ones of the Empire State Building overcame them well by ultimately adapting the mast for other uses like broadcasting."
596	15429	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the structure, but they overlooked the potential problems inherent in their design. A very significant problem they faced was the issue of safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, tragically blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a far greater catastrophe if a similar incident occurred in the densely populated heart of New York. Nature also posed a serious and unpredictable problem. Powerful and shifting air currents at that altitude could violently sway the dirigible while it was attempting to dock on top of the building, making the operation extremely hazardous. And finally, they could not attempt this venture because it was explicitly illegal. Existing aviation laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas for safety reasons. These combined factors all made it much harder to put a functional mast on the Empire State Building, ultimately dooming the ambitious plan.
597	15430	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged by the formidable obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there successfully. These dirigibles, or blimps, were large, lighter-than-air balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great and stable landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as a practical form of transportation, architects needed to design a suitably robust mooring mast. However, the immense weight and the constant pressure of a blimp pulling on a mast would cause a large amount of structural stress to the building's steel frame. The builders were consequently faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" just to reinforce the building's framework. Not only was attempting to have blimps dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were also challenged with profound safety issues. As experienced with the tragic fate of the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that used hydrogen were known to be ""highly flammable."" If any such incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area, potentially killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to public safety that a specific law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature itself was a persistent obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At most times, the ""forceful winds"" at that height would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously, which could lead to it hitting the building's sharp spires and being punctured. The use of heavy lead weights for stabilization was also not safe when dangling precariously over pedestrians on the streets below. These significant obstacles collectively made it profoundly difficult to create the necessary gear that would allow dirigibles to dock safely on the building."
598	15431	6	3	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many challenges the builders of the Empire State building faced while they had high hopes in creating the world's tallest building. They added on hundreds of feet with the specific intention of allowing dirigibles to dock there. Competing fiercely with the Chrysler building, Al Smith announced that the Empire State building would ultimately reach 1,250 feet, decisively beating the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Al Smith was desperate to do whatever he could to construct the world's tallest building, even to the point of creating a novel landing spot for dirigibles. Unfortunately, @ORGANIZATION2's ambitious idea didn't work out as originally planned. Instead, the @CAPS1 that was originally assigned for dirigible passengers was eventually converted into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden, serving as a lasting reminder of the failed venture.
599	15432	6	3	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 is a story that takes the reader through the numerous obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, a four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was out of office. Smith was highly competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the coveted title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he publicly announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would achieve this by adding a distinctive top or hat to the building. The central idea was to add a mooring mast and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. However, architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building and held by a single cable tether would add tremendous stress to the building's frame. The combined stress of a dirigible's load with the constant pressure of wind would transmit forces all the way down to the building's foundation. The elaborate plans that had builders working so hard on the framework and observation decks ultimately failed. It was simply not practical or safe to dock a massive dirigible so high above the city. By the late 1930s, the ambitious idea was completely given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and remains a very popular attraction in New York today."
600	15433	6	3	During the times of the Empire State Building and its claim to fame with height, its @CAPS1 Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of its construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design for its intended purpose. Al Smith realized this fundamental flaw even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced further operational obstacles. The dirigibles had significant problems with docking; due to the strong wind and the unpredictable elements at that altitude, the dirigibles had a very hard time staying stationary once docked. Another critical obstacle was fuel; due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with safer helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen, which was scarce. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast project to fail legally. Eventually, airplanes took the dirigibles' position as the future of air travel and the mooring mast was retired from its intended use. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, Al Smith gave up on the mooring mast concept, but his building still secured the record for the world's highest building.
601	15434	6	3	One obstacle the builders had to face was the significant amount of wind that was blowing that high in the air. The dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway dangerously from the back, complicating the docking procedure. Another critical obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. Being filled up with such a flammable gas meant that any spark or mishap could easily turn into a disaster, especially with all the people who were so close to it on the ground below. These fundamental challenges proved too great to overcome for regular operations.
602	15435	6	3	"During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders faced some significant obstacles. One obstacle was that they couldn't just ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" First, they had to do extensive work on the building so it could support the immense load. As the source said, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation,"" a costly and complex engineering task. Another obstacle the builders faced was the safety risk; if there was an accident, like the Hindenburg, it would be much more dangerous because there would be many more people nearby who could get hurt by the fire. ""The greatest obstacle of the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" said the source. The wind currents above the building shifted due to ""violent air currents,"" making stable approach nearly impossible. Also, dirigibles need to have weights attached at the back of them, but at the Empire State Building, these weights would be dangling high above pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe. The other obstacle was that blimps couldn't get close enough to the mast due to the wind, a problem exemplified by the attempted approach of the Los Angeles. Due to all of these obstacles, the mooring mast has not been used since its installation."
603	15436	6	3	"The Empire State Building's construction workers attempted to build a dirigible dock on top of the world's tallest building, but many problems occurred during the process. In order to have a dirigible dock on the top of the building, the structure would have to withstand its weight and the dynamic forces of a moored airship. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" as noted by the source. The 102-story building was predicted to be a success and was heralded as the beginning of a new age of aviation travel. Another obstacle that the workers faced was realizing that dirigibles from outside the United States were highly flammable because they contained hydrogen. It would be disastrous if one caught on fire on the top of the building in New York City. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" the source stated. There are very strong and violent winds at the top of the building; the blimp could become a hazard if it was blown out of control. A blimp hovering over hundreds of pedestrians in the city of New York is a definite hazard, and there is also a law forbidding aircraft from flying too low over populated areas. Having a mooring dock was a good idea, but it was never really practical or safe, as many bad things could have happened if it was actually used regularly."
604	15437	6	3	The builders had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, but there were a couple of main ones. The first main obstacle was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add tremendous stress to the building's frame. So with that, they could not simply put the mooring mast on top of the building yet until they did some major structural adjustments to reinforce the summit. With that big problem addressed, the builders' next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself, requiring precise architectural planning. The last significant obstacle the builders had to face was that the mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that had to be carefully built and put up at a great height. Those were some of the key obstacles the builders had to face while trying to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, a venture that ultimately proved more symbolic than functional.
605	15438	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature, and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was also an existing law against these airships. Docking the dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building's structure from the weight and the pull of the massive airships. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall to reinforce it. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States; they used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. There was one incident on May 6, 1937, where the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, a tragedy known as the Hindenburg disaster. Builders knew this could pose a grave risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself; when the dirigibles would attempt to dock, violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the mooring mast, making a secure connection impossible. Furthermore, the law against airships stated they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas, creating a legal barrier to its operation. These combined factors rendered the ambitious docking plan unfeasible.
606	15439	6	3	When building the Empire State Building the developers wanted to keep it the tallest in New York. They modified the building's design so that it would not be succeeded by the Chrysler Building. It's original property was not to be a mooring mast; the idea was added later. The Empire State Building had to be reframed to support the mast, but then the government banned aircraft from flying too low. Furthermore, commercial airliners took over the aviation industry, making airships obsolete. It was too dangerous for dirigibles to dock because the strong wind currents around the skyscraper could blow them out of place, causing potential accidents similar to the Hindenburg disaster.
607	15440	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there are many obstacles the builders are faced with while in the process of building a dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the height of the building. That meant more framework, more material, and more safety hazards, all because of the building's extreme height. Another obstacle was public safety. After already building a more secure building, the workers realized that a densely populated area such as downtown New York wouldn't be the best place to be if there ever was an accident. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Nature played a great part as an obstacle because it would always be unpredictable. The high-altitude winds would also whip the backend of the dirigible, so it would be unsafe and unsteady for passengers attempting to disembark. These are some of the significant obstacles builders had to face while constructing the famous mooring mast."
608	15441	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, people had to go through some obstacles to have it the way they wanted. They wanted dirigibles to be able to land and board passengers directly on the Empire State Building. One of their obstacles was the use of such aircraft in New York City and a lack of suitable landing area, which was a significant problem for large airships. The other obstacle was a practical one, involving the technical difficulties of securing the airship safely. Ultimately, the use of dirigibles for the mooring mast was not successful, as the concept proved unworkable in practice.
609	15442	6	3	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was one of the primary challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without sufficient space, this was a challenge the builders faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, as ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement for the docking had not yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge. Lastly, the builders faced safety issues, as they ""... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""—this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles had not been assured yet. Altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant challenges such as the lack of landing areas, the need for a practical design, and ensuring passenger and public safety."
610	15443	6	3	"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasn't. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a seven-hundred-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Also, one of the greatest obstacles was the violent winds that constantly change due to unpredictable air currents around the tall structure. Furthermore, the dirigible would be dangling precariously above pedestrians on the street, which isn't safe for those below. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships to fly low over urban areas, which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it a realistic or safe endeavor."
611	15444	6	3	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was a profound concern for public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable and volatile element. An accident involving such a craft in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic, leading to immense loss of life and property. The second obstacle were the violent and unpredictable winds on top of the building, which created a dangerously unstable environment for a large, buoyant aircraft. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not a practical solution, because they would be dangling precariously high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap, such as a snapped line, would send those heavy weights flying down and causing certain destruction below. The third and final obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This regulation made the entire idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building not only impractical but also explicitly illegal and completely out of the question from the start."
612	15445	6	3	"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As stated, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The most important issue was that many blimps used hydrogen, which was highly flammable and posed a severe fire risk. An accident would have been tragic and devastating because of the heavily populated downtown area of New York City, where any incident would result in a high number of casualties. Also, nature itself proposed a significant obstacle as well, with the observation that ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These powerful gusts made any attempt at a stable docking procedure nearly impossible. Furthermore, there was an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier that ultimately helped prevent the risky plan from moving forward."
613	15446	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from outside of the United States. This was a critical problem because hydrogen is very flammable and can ignite easily. When the German dirigible was destroyed in a fiery accident in New Jersey, the architects of the Empire State Building realized just how dangerous it was to operate such vessels near a city. Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather and the powerful winds at such a great height. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making a safe and secure docking maneuver incredibly difficult. A final, practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles was because of the law against airships. The law explicitly stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building in the heart of New York. These are a few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which collectively prevented the use of the mooring mast for its intended purpose."
614	15447	6	3	"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building was a great and forward-thinking idea. However, in reality, it didn't turn out so well due to several significant challenges. There are many reasons why a dirigible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium."" This was exceptionally dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, such as a spark or a collision, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate and the powerful wind conditions around the Empire State Building. There is a constant, powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building itself creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all in such turbulent conditions. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people walking below. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This legal restriction provided a final, insurmountable barrier to the plan."
615	15448	6	3	"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose of docking airships. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, many obstacles were clearly stated as to why the mast was not a good idea. The building of the mast was rushed; Al Smith had realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building and quickly put the mast into the plans. Problems quickly arose during the planning stages. The first problem was the lack of a suitable and safe landing area for passengers. Al Smith had stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze from the mast to the building, a proposal that was far from realistic. This initial problem was ignored and soon other, greater problems arose as the building of the mast continued. The greatest problem that should have been considered before building the mast was nature itself. The winds were horrible at the height of the building and architects soon realized that landing a massive, lightweight dirigible would be a major issue in such violent air currents. The feasibility of the mast was still being questioned as architects and engineers were doing all they could to make it work, until a final obstacle was brought upon them: a law. It was discovered that it is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The realization of this law marked the end of Al Smith's ambitious idea, and by the late 1930's, the plan for using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."
616	15449	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are blimps, which are a type of lighter-than-air craft. The first obstacle for the Empire State Building had to do with just the sheer size of the operation. The Empire State building was very competitive with the Chrysler Building in the race to be the world's tallest. Some opinions were that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" There was also the obstacle to their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area in the dense urban environment. They added a mooring mast to the building's spire in an attempt to solve this. There was many trials and tribulations involved in making the Empire State building suitable for this ambitious plan, which ultimately proved unsuccessful."
617	15450	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. One obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building. It needed to be changed entirely to accommodate landing dirigibles, requiring significant structural reinforcement: ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the renovations for the redesigned, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the level of safety, which was a major concern. Thousands of lives could have been lost if a dirigible accident occurred in New York City, a terrifying prospect: ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@NUM2). The biggest obstacle by far was the elements. Dirigibles were easily swayed in times of bad weather, making them difficult to control: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was very unsafe because of the dense population of people in New York City. If a dirigible swiveled around the mooring mast too much, it could hit another building or crash into the streets below. The people behind the construction of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties, therefore the mooring mast was never used for its intended purpose."
618	15451	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the building's framework, a complex and costly undertaking. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible pulling on the mooring mast. The next problem the workers encountered was the unpredictable wind currents at such a great height. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents, creating a hazardous situation. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height over the city. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier to the plan. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building, contributing to the ultimate failure of the dirigible docking concept.
619	15452	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The builders did not fully think of what would happen to the dirigibles if something went wrong during the docking process. Also, they had to consider the implications of how tall they were making the Empire State Building and the environment at that altitude. The first obstacle the builders faced was what if something happened to the dirigibles, such as a catastrophic failure. For example, what if the dirigibles are highly flammable like the Hindenburg was, posing a great fire risk. The second obstacle the builders faced was related to how tall they made it; because of how tall it was the wind current was very strong and unpredictable at the summit. In the end, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. They tried to overcome them but there were too many practical and safety challenges to make the plan viable.
620	15453	6	3	The obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. One of the obstacles to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, as the urban canyon of Manhattan offered no open spaces. Also, the Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame, requiring a complete structural redesign. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, which proved impossible to control. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable connection nearly impossible. The last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, creating a regulatory blockade. This was demonstrated when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds, a failed attempt that highlighted the impracticality of the entire venture.
621	15454	6	3	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of their problems included, the structure of the building, the wind and weather conditions, and the safety of their passengers. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation, as the immense strain of a moored airship was a significant concern. The building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a stainless steel skeleton. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a highly unstable environment for a large, buoyant craft. The back of the ship would swivel around and would need lead weights to hold it down, a solution that was clearly considered unsafe and impractical. Finally the safety of the passengers, was at stake because the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed, leaving the entire procedure dangerously incomplete. Also, There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier that could not be overcome. These are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building due to the many obstacles.
622	15455	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the empire state building. One major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts. one law prohibited air crafts from flying too low over urban areas, making the proposed docking operation illegal from the start. another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas, and after the accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion the builders realized the risk of accidents was far too great. Mother nature presented the largest obstacle through, the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll, making a stable connection impossible. The builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea, concluding it was not feasible.
623	15456	6	3	"The empire state building was the building designed to be the world's tallest building. With this the governor Al Smith wanted the building to be more than ornamental as he says in his comments in paragraph three. Al Smith wanted the Empire State building to be equipped for an age of transportation. He wanted to create the latest attraction for the dirigibles. Which was to allow dirigibles to dock there, envisioning a future where airships would connect directly to the skyscraper. yet allowing this, little did they know that builders would face obstacles that would prove insurmountable. With the idea of the Dirigibles, Al Smith Saw a great opportunity for innovation and prestige. When he was asked about the Mooring Mast idea AL Smith Said, ""It's on the Level, all right. No kidding. were working on the thing now,"" expressing his genuine belief in the project's potential. Although the Mooring Mast of the empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, as explained on paragraph thirteen, it remains a testament to an ambitious but ultimately unrealized vision."
624	15457	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects, creating a perilous environment for navigation. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings and unpredictable air currents. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point, risking a catastrophic collision. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1), creating a legal blockade. Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles, which used a highly combustible gas. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium, increasing the danger significantly. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2), highlighting the public safety risk. The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building, posing a structural challenge. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3), a tremendous force to manage. They knew this was very unsafe for the passengers unloading and for the people in the building, jeopardizing everyone involved. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome, leading to the concept's abandonment."
625	15458	6	3	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller, so they had to come up with something fast to fix that and reclaim the title. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, authorities had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed out for safety and legal reasons. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts at such a great height wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers, presenting a fundamental and unsolvable problem with the concept. In the end, the combination of these issues proved too great, and the ambitious plan was never realized.
626	15459	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted explains some problems architect Al Smith experienced when constructing the world's tallest building in the 1920s. For example, ""The greatest issue was one of safety."" Safety was a major obstacle because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle faced in this attempt was ""nature itself."" Nature was one of many major problems to allow a dirigible to dock. For example, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The winds would shift the ship and it would be very difficult to land on the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. The other practical problem builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This regulation presented a legal barrier that could not be overcome. The entire idea was eventually dropped by the late 1930s after these significant challenges proved insurmountable. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the creation of ""The Mooring Mast."""
627	15460	6	3	When constructing a mooring mast, the builders ran into many problems. Safety was the main problem they ran into. Since most blimps outside of the United States were hydrogen not helium, they were very flammable. After the Hindenburg blimp was destroyed by a fire, people in New York City feared that would happen by the Empire State Building, creating public opposition to the project. Another problem they ran into was the law. At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas, which legally prevented the docking procedure. When tested, some blimps couldn't get close enough because of the heavy winds at such a high altitude. This made it impossible to tie blimps up and let people off. It also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other building which would put a hole in the blimp, leading to a potential disaster. It was a good idea, but there were just too many obstacles they had to go around to make the blimp docking station and mooring mast successful, ultimately leading to the concept's abandonment.
628	15461	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New York pedestrians walk, posing a grave danger. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as the text says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed, demonstrating the catastrophic risks involved. These combined factors made the plan unworkable."
629	15462	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders of the empire state building had to deal with many obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author tells us the readers that dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. While the builders were trying to droop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof, they encountered significant structural concerns. In the excerpt tells us the reader that ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" All though the dirigible is as light as the air it could mess up the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders had to face was when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The owner of the empire state building realized how much worse it would have been the accident happened in New York such as a populated area as downtown. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". Even though the empire state building didn't get to put moors on top of the building it still became the world's tallest building, its legacy secured without the dirigible dock."
630	15463	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State building were always shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, creating an unstable and hazardous situation for both the aircraft and the building. Another obstacle builders faced was a law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ""ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it, rendering the entire concept of a skyscraper docking mast against regulations. These fundamental issues of natural forces and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the ambitious plan from ever becoming a practical reality."
631	15464	6	3	"From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2 we find that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their first obstacle was to figure out how to transfer ""the stress of the dirigible's load and windpressurs"" to the buildings foundation, a significant engineering challenge. Another was to modify the steel frame of Building and strengthen it to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast, requiring substantial reinforcement. And so the builders did modify the building and assigned a mooring mast, but when construction was completed builder came upon another obstacle. ""most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a danger if any would go up in flames above New York. The greatest obstacle with the winds. They were constantly shifting making it difficult for any dirigibles to even get close to the mast even if the could get to the mast the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast where in open fields dirigibles would be weighed down with lead weights. at the Empire state building they would be dangling higabove pedestrians, this was niether practical or safe. Because of all the obstacles the Mooring Mast would never be used for its intended purpose."
632	15465	6	3	The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world, creating a precarious situation. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed, causing a major disaster. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop, creating a hazardous scenario. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose as an airship terminal.
633	15466	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come, a visionary prospect. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast, a complex structural undertaking. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside, creating a striking landmark. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous due to the high winds and urban setting. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose, becoming a monument to an unrealized ambition.
634	15467	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York where a fire would be catastrophic. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, presenting a legal barrier. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work in practice. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete successfully."
635	15468	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main obstacles was, the lack of a good landing area. Dirigibles were pretty big and there wasn't a great spot for it. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as flour blocks in New York City""- paragraph 6, illustrating their immense scale. therefore caused problems to the builders to figure out where to put it, as the massive airships required a vast and clear area for safe maneuvering and docking, which the skyscraper's pinnacle could not adequately provide. This fundamental issue of scale and space contributed to the impracticality of the entire venture from the very beginning."
636	15469	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were many factors in the way of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" went up in flames in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State building realized ""how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" a disaster that would have been catastrophic. Another obstacle was the existing law against low-flying airships in urban areas. This law makes it so that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" creating a legal barrier that could not be overcome. The greatest obstacle of all, however, was mother nature. The winds that high in the sky were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and would be unsafe to passengers and pedestrians on the street below, making any attempted landing perilous. All of these factors contributed to the project never being fulfilled in New York, rendering the ambitious plan ultimately impractical."
637	15470	6	3	"In a competition with the architect building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to construct a taller building with a purpose. That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then there were problems; in the beginning, the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" So, with the time they had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fulfil it's purpose..."" only in theory. Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flammable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be executed successfully. Only two dirigibles ever docked there and it has never been used since, standing as a monument to a failed vision."
638	15471	6	3	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that. The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns. The weather at the top of the building was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating an unstable and dangerous situation. Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937,"" highlighting the very real danger. These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether, sealing the fate of the mooring mast."
639	15472	6	3	The obstacles faced by the Empire State building builders were significant. One was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the intended operation. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable mooring nearly impossible. Furthermore, a dirigible moored at the top of the building and held by a cable tether would have put considerable stress on the building; therefore, they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger to withstand the additional forces. These combined challenges of law, weather, and structural integrity proved too great to overcome for the ambitious docking plan.
640	15473	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This is because it would have added too much stress to the frame of the Empire State Building, which could have caused the collapse over a period of time. So the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation,"" as said in the excerpt, requiring significant structural redesign. After the builders completed framing the Empire State Building up to the eighty-fifth floor, it was now time to do the framing of the rooftop to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. After the workers completed the framing of the rooftop, they built the mooring mast on to it; now the builders faced the challenge of framing the mooring mast itself. The builders framed the mooring mast with a skeleton of steel, a complex engineering task. The builders faced these significant structural and engineering challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, challenges that were ultimately surmounted only for the mast to remain largely unused."
641	15474	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was structural. If a dirigible, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the top of the building, it would add significant stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress, an engineering challenge that cost over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished, primarily concerning safety. The first reason why it was unsafe is that most dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for a dirigible, which would swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast. All these challenges, along with an existing law that did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas, were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there.
642	15475	6	3	"Challenges can be faced when radical ideas are put into action. When faced with the task of docking dirigibles, or zeppelins, atop the Empire State Building, the builders ran into challenges that are natural to come along with new thoughts. One challenge included was the fact that the wind from such an altitude as the Empire State Building made situations perilous for blimps and people on the ground. The powerful and unpredictable air currents created a hazardous environment for docking. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" demonstrating the lack of control. Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with the laws of the United States government, which presented a legal barrier to the plan's feasibility. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These were some of the significant difficulties dealt with by builders in the construction of the Empire State Building's mast, ultimately dooming the ambitious concept."
643	15476	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles were dangerous when not handled correctly, posing a grave public risk. If an accident occurred, many people could die because the building was within a densely populated area of New York City. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The powerful wind @CAPS1 was also an issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there; the wind at that height was very forceful, and would become a major problem for stability. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states in relation to the wind, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, which created a legal impediment. Paragraph @NUM3 states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" Ultimately @CAPS2, all of these obstacles combined made it impossible in the end for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building as originally envisioned."
644	15477	6	3	"The builders of the mooring mast planned the construction well, but did not fully consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of significant safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, from other countries used hydrogen rather than helium, which is a highly volatile gas. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed, especially since New York has many people that walk everywhere in the dense urban environment. The builders also needed to consider the violent winds at such a high altitude, which were a constant factor. These winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel safely. The winds are constantly shifting and could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is also a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" I think that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record for the building than on the potential dangers of the mast, which led to the concept's failure."
645	15478	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. Due to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they eventually shelved the idea. One of the obstacles the builders realized was that if a foreign dirigible were to dock and have an accident with any heat or a spark, it would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women, and children, due to the chemicals that are used on foreign dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Furthermore @CAPS1, another obstacle they faced was violent winds, that would knock the dirigibles around and make a safe mooring impossible. ""Winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" All in all the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were so great that they eventually shelved the idea entirely."
646	15479	6	3	In the story, construction workers faced a significant problem as the idea of having a dirigible's dock on top of the Empire State Building was coming to an end. When initially thinking about the idea, the architecture team never put thought into the legal pressures, such as the regulation that aircraft cannot fly low over urban areas. Another major issue was the heavy wind that picks up around the building, creating violent gusts that made the air craft hard to control and nearly impossible to dock safely. There was also the considerable danger they could inflict to civilians below; if not secured right, the air craft could get loose and dangle perilously down to urban areas or, like the German dirigible, catch on fire and blow up catastrophically. Even though they had a prototype that work in theory, they ultimately discontinued the project, giving air planes the better and more practical way to travel in the air.
647	15480	6	3	There's more than one obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature, specifically the unpredictable and powerful weather conditions at such a great height. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a turbulent environment that posed a severe challenge for any airship attempting to approach or moor. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor on the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, a regulation designed to protect the densely populated city from potential hazards. These combined factors of natural forces and legal restrictions ultimately made the ambitious docking plan unfeasible.
648	15481	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, presenting a formidable and unpredictable challenge. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down securely to the mooring mast, as the airships were buffeted by powerful gusts. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas; the dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break this law explicitly. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor, primarily because dirigibles outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen rather than safer helium to fill their envelopes. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose, leading to a catastrophic disaster. These were a few key examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their ultimately abandoned endeavor.
649	15482	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, as a massive dirigible dangling over the crowded streets of New York City does not seem very safe for the populace below. The project also faced scrutiny because it wasn't a reasonable thing to build from a practical standpoint; the empire state building was already tall enough without the mast, so why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway and would add complexity for little benefit. These fundamental issues of public risk and questionable utility ultimately undermined the proposal's viability."
650	15483	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, intending to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, or service, but they couldn't do that because engineering studies revealed that ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame,"" potentially compromising its structural integrity. Furthermore, Al Smith didn't get to allow the dirigibles to land on the building because of how skinny the top was, which provided an insufficient and unstable platform for such a large and cumbersome aircraft to safely dock. These physical and structural limitations proved insurmountable, ending the ambitious plan."
651	15484	6	3	"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring mast was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was structural; while an airship was tethered to the building it would add immense stress, as ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" posing a significant engineering challenge. Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety, particularly concerning the gas used for lift. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable and created a substantial fire risk. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents creating unpredictable conditions; a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building. The only proposed way to prevent this dangerous spinning would be to tie lead weights to the rear end, but the idea of massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle was the legal one, faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all critical obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever began, ultimately dooming the ambitious project to failure."
652	15485	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 there are many reasons that a proper, working mast was impossible, stemming from a combination of natural, mechanical, and legal challenges. There were natural reasons and mechanical reasons, as well as issues of time and public safety. Nature played a key role in this project's failure, as the winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" because of the location and height of the building, creating a turbulent and unpredictable environment for any docking attempt. When the two blimps attempted to go near to test it out, the practical results were disastrous; one was too unstable to dock and the other, after failing to connect, simply threw paper down a rope to the spectators below. It was ""after this stunt the idea of the mooring mast was shelved"" for good. Furthermore, @CAPS1 replaced the blimps over time for long-distance travel, and the fact that many blimps were filled with flammable and dangerous hydrogen gas added to the concerns. Also, flying at that height over the city was illegal, creating an insurmountable regulatory barrier that confirmed the project's impracticality from the start."
653	15486	6	3	When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused severe complications in docking dirigibles. One significant factor was the legal restriction; by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below, creating an unacceptable public hazard. Another critical factor was the powerful and unpredictable air currents around the tall buildings, especially around the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was successfully tethered to the mooring mast, the fierce winds would violently rock it, and the craft could easily crash against the building's facade and fall to the streets below. A recent and terrifying factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937, a disaster that was fresh in the public's mind. Nobody wanted to risk that catastrophic event happening over the densely populated New York City, either. So because of the dangers of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and legal prohibitions, the builders faced insurmountable complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there, rendering the entire concept unworkable.
654	15487	6	3	Several distinct obstacles made the concept of a dirigible mooring mast impractical and hazardous. Some obstacles were physical, such as the fact that there were many sharp rods and spires on surrounding buildings and so if the large, gas-filled envelope of a dirigible touched one it could easily pop, leading to a catastrophic deflation. Another primary obstacle was the weather; if the wind was blowing with any significant force, it was hard and unsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building, as the gusts could slam the airship against the structure or send it into an uncontrollable spin. These fundamental issues of the urban landscape and unpredictable meteorological conditions presented dangers that were simply too great to overcome for the mooring mast to ever become a functional reality, sealing the fate of the ambitious plan.
655	15488	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face regarding the proposed mooring mast for dirigibles. One significant obstacle involved constructing a strong enough structural frame for the entire building so that a thousand-foot dirigible could be held by the single tether cable without compromising the building's integrity. Another major obstacle that builders of the Empire State Building faced was the issue of safety, specifically concerning the lifting gas used by most dirigibles from outside the U.S. at the time, which was hydrogen rather than helium; this made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable and a single spark could cause a disaster. This flammability risk made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the Empire State Building, a task that proved nearly impossible in the crowded airspace. These were @NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State were faced with, highlighting the immense practical challenges that ultimately prevented the mooring mast from being used as intended.
656	15489	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION2's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over the crowded streets of New York City would be very dangerous and potentially catastrophic. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making a controlled approach extremely dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down securely on the ground. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no practical way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it against the powerful gusts. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire State illegal from the outset. For these many practical reasons, the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State was effectively crushed."
657	15490	6	3	"Many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Like it states in the text, this was a fundamental design challenge. Also, ""rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be eliminated from inside. With a step-back to imitate the overall shape of the building itself."" It further explains that this aesthetic choice was integral to the mast's design, blending function with the building's iconic Art Deco style. These architectural decisions highlight the complex interplay between ambition and practical engineering that defined the project."
658	15491	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their main obstacles was the building's framework. They had to design it so the building could bear the immense stress of the dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work they would use different, stronger types of steel in the construction. Another obstacle for the builders would be safety, with winds and hydrogen as main focuses. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They would also be careful of pedestrians, as ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"". Those are just two examples of the significant challenges the builders of the Empire State Building had to consider for this ambitious concept."
659	15492	6	3	There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building. This idea was hardly practical, for safety reasons mostly. If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building's structural integrity. Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catastrophic, endangering the entire area. The task of actually docking would be a problem as well. With such a high altitude, winds were very strong and unpredictable. Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building violently. In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights for stability. However, if these were to fall from such a height, they would land in the busy city streets of New York, posing a grave risk to people below. Lastly, there was a law against low flying airships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building as an unfeasible venture.
660	15493	6	3	"In trying to build a dock at the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, the workers faced many obstacles. One reason is because ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" because it would only be held by ""a single cable tether"" which would add immense stress to the building's structure. And the only way to fix this would be to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" to strengthen it sufficiently. Another obstacle was ""nature itself"". This is because the winds would be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" at that great height. And the one way to solve it would be to put lead weights to weigh down the blimp, but its not ""practical nor safe"" to do so on a mast high above the city. The last reason why is because of the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" so it would ""make it illegal for a ship to ever tie to the building,"" rendering the entire concept impossible to implement legally."
661	15494	6	3	"In an attempt to allow dirigibles, otherwise known as zeppelins or blimps to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles along the way. Al Smith stated ""... engineers here in New York [are] trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement"" (paragraph @NUM1). First, they would not drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This would add too much stress to the frame and it would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation, requiring significant and costly structural reinforcement"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen, which is very flammable. When the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire, ""the owners... realized how much worse that could have been if it had taken place above a densly populated area such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM3). The most significant obstacle was ""nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM4). Due to violent air currents, ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting"" (paragraph @NUM4). In open areas, dirigibles could be weighted down by lead weights, but this poses a threat to pedestrians on the street, as the weights would be dangling above them. Lastly, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM6). This law makes docking at the Empire State building illegal, presenting a final, insurmountable legal barrier. The builders of the Empire State Building thus faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately rendering the concept impractical."
662	15495	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to @CAPS1 or fly a ship in New York City, thereby dooming the entire enterprise from a regulatory standpoint.
663	15496	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind was to fast for the builders at that altitude. This shows that they didn't want any dirigibles to fall on any stores below, posing a significant public safety risk. Second, they didn't finish the building because the building couldn't hold all the weight that they wanted to put on top of it, indicating a fundamental structural limitation. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily, creating a potential for catastrophic disaster over the city. In brief, there were many problems that made the Empire State Building a bad idea to dock a dirigible, leading to the eventual abandonment of the plan.
664	15497	6	3	Durining the @DATE1 and the 1930s, there was a fierce competition arising over constructing the largest building. To set the Empire State Building apart from the @ORGANIZATION1 decided to put a mooring mask for dirigibles. This would have both meaning and make the Empire State Building the worlds largest building. The mooring mask was certin to fail for a few reasons. For one, forign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flamable and would cause a huge fire @CAPS1, a risk deemed unacceptable. Another reason is above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantely shifting. This would make it very difficult to control the dirigible. Pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty @CAPS2 their dirigible in such treacherous conditions. Lastly the mooring dock failed because of the law. This law stated that it is illegal to fly air ships to low over urban areas. On 1931 @CAPS3 Clavan @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 of the mooring mask. By the late 1930's the Idea was dead, a forgotten relic of an ambitious but impractical vision.
665	15498	6	3	The builders of the Empire state building faced alot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing areas. They usually land in open fields, where they are weighed down with lead weights. In New York they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, creating a constant hazard. Another obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. They worried an accident like the Hindenburg could happen, only this time it would be above a densely populated area, multiplying the potential for tragedy. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The Final obstacle was Forceful winds. They could blow the dirigible onto the Sharp spires of other buildings and puncture the Shell, the captain couldn't take his hands off the control levers even for a moment. All in all the mooring mast was not a very well thoughtout idea and it would not have been safe at all, ensuring its ultimate failure.
666	15499	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structural and safety issues. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework to reinforce it against the immense strain. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pedestrians created an even bigger obstacle for the builders. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazards. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Even though the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles' shells could be punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making any attempted docking maneuver perilous. Ultimately, this combination of factors rendered the ambitious mooring mast impractical."
667	15500	6	3	"The builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. There were several problems with the design and location of the mooring mast. One problem was that ""the winds on top of the building, were constantly shifting."" This created unpredictable and dangerous conditions for any airship attempting to approach. Even though the architects adjusted the design of the mast, it was still too dangerous to land a blimp securely. Another major problem was the dirigibles themselves. They were filled with combustible hydrogen, which posed a significant risk of explosion. If a blimp was to catch fire, like the Hindenburg, the burning debris would fall on the pedestrians below, causing a catastrophe in the city streets. The last problem was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which legally prohibited the very operation the mast was built for. In conclusion, due to laws, the dangerous nature of the dirigibles, and the forces of nature, the mooring mast was not used."
668	15501	6	3	"The first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the extreme height they are already at, which presented a significant logistical challenge. Also, as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 therefore the power of the wind is a huge obstacle, repeatedly preventing any successful connection. Another obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM1 is that ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 the law was another obstacle they had to face, creating a legal barrier that was impossible to overcome. These combined difficulties ensured the mooring mast remained an unused feature."
669	15502	6	3	The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building had many problems with actually docking any dirigibles there. When they @CAPS1 building the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. One accident could harm hundreds of people in New York's streets below with falling, burning wreckage. The wind on top of the building was also very strong, making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough to dock safely. The last difficulty that the builders had was laws. There were certain laws not allowing air ships to fly too low over high populated urban areas, which legally forbade the practice. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea to start out with, sadly it never got much use due to these insurmountable problems.
670	15503	6	3	"Based on the information given in the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were critical to the usage of the dock. Not only is it a challenge to build a 102 story building but when factoring in wind and other weather conditions it is not an easy task. In order for the builders of the Empire State Building to create and hoist the dock to the top they needed to first reinforce the skeleton of the building itself. ""The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 constructing the mooring mast the builders had to think about the violent wind speeds and the structure of the building to support itself and the immense load of a docked airship. There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to work through to complete their project, though the mast itself ultimately proved impractical."
671	15504	6	3	The primary obstacle to the successful use of the morning mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating an unpredictable and hazardous environment for any airship attempting to approach or remain tethered. These powerful gusts made stable docking a near-impossibility, ultimately dooming the ambitious concept to failure.
672	15505	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacle to successfully using the mooring mast was nature itself, but after the initial celebrating, they were disappointed because the dirigibles were not able to dock securely. After that, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would fly up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. When the stunt was not a success, it became clear the blimp could not be used for practical transportation in the future, marking the end of the endeavor.
673	15506	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in their attempt to allow the docking of dirigibles. There was no way architects could simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof without considerable structural changes. If a thousand-foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, immense stress on the building's frame would be added instantly. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builders was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened considerably to accommodate this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would have needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsteady and prone to swinging. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street would heighten the architects' concern for the population's safety. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a building, or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigibles to reach a building, the entire idea was eventually dropped, much to the architects' disappointment.
674	15507	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. If the blimp was docked over a large city like New York City, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire, posing a severe risk to life and property. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather, making them difficult to control. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling dangerously over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin uncontrollably around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to be blown by the wind, it would risk crashing into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These are the significant obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
675	15508	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified. The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the Empire State Building's frame. For this reason they first had to make costly changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen its frame. The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to moor dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was just general safety. After the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would have been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as New York City. It wasn't just the possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though. Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast. The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on the ground is through the hanging of weights on its back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because if the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody. The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place. In the end, the fact that there were so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming a reality at all.
676	15509	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle they faced was nature itself. It says in the exerpt that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This persistent and unpredictable movement could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here, potentially causing the airship to collide with the mast or the building itself. Another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly too low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that ""these was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of news papers. They didn't have the right equipment so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope. These obstacles were very important to the construction of the mast because it's probably saved the lifes not only the aviators but the people that lived in urban cities below, proving the concept to be ultimately impractical and unsafe."
677	15510	6	3	"In the 1930's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours, providing a central terminal. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, as it required significant structural consideration. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire state Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This legal barrier presented an insurmountable problem. In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it did'nt work, confirming the inherent difficulties of the plan."
678	15511	6	3	Their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. The first problem they faced was safety. Alot of dirigible especialy those from out side the unitestates used hydrogen which is highly flammable. So this was not safe in a place with a big number of population like down town New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because In case of an accident there could be a large amount of deaths, reminiscent of the Hindenburg disaster. The second ob stacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stable in one place. Instead it would just go around and around the mast, creating a hazardous situation for both the airship and the building. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas. So It was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire state building, rendering the entire concept against regulations from the start.
679	15512	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith Announced that the Empire State building would be reaching the height of 1,250 feet; taller then the previous largest building, the Chrysler Building. Smith made the building taller by adding a top or a hat. John Tauranac described this as ""[The top of the empire State Building] would be more than an ornament... The empire state building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers"" (pg 1). This dream consisted of having a mooring mass at the top of the building to dock dirigible, or blimbs. However, many obsticles emerged the more they began to plan this, such as the amount of stress it would add to the buildings frame, the use of hydrogen opposed to helium, and simply nature itself. ""A thousand-foot drigible held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame... The Empire State building would have to... [have] over one million dollars worth of modifications (pg 1). ""Most diribles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg 1)"". ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... they would be dangling high above pedestrians... that was neither safe nor practical"". These combined factors of cost, safety, and natural forces ultimately prevented the visionary docking scheme from becoming a reality."
680	15513	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mass. This process required a large, clear, and stable ground area, which the mast atop a skyscraper could not provide. Also the body of the dirigibles they could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off, but this was only feasible in controlled conditions at ground level, not while tethered high above the city streets where gusts could cause dangerous swaying. The fundamental mismatch between the needs of airship docking and the reality of the skyscraper's design proved to be a decisive obstacle.
681	15514	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles while building a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State building. One was that they had to strengthen the foundation so that all the stress on the building's structure wouldn't tear it apart, a costly and complex engineering undertaking. Also the fact it was impractical for a dirigible mast because shifting currents and winds would either make it impossible to land or would circle the blimp around and hit buildings, creating a constant hazard. The workers faced these obstacles and finally realized that they couldn't do it, ultimately abandoning the plan as unfeasible.
682	15515	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 outlines the problems architects had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The idea was impractical, mainly because of safety reasons. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable and posed a significant fire risk. If an accident were to occur, the dirigible would crash into the thousands of pedestrians in New York City, leading to a catastrophe. Nature was another reason why this idea was impractical. In New York City, there was constantly shifting winds that swiveled the dirigible out of control, even when docked, making stable mooring nearly impossible. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent the back from swiveling, but in New York City ""they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe."" Furthermore, @CAPS1, air laws prevented the dirigible docks from becoming a reality. It was illegal for the dirigibles to even approach the area because of how low they would have to fly over the densely populated metropolis. Mooring masts were impractical and ""never fulfilled its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."""
683	15516	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia amidon @CAPS1 there was a few obstacles while trying to build a dock for the Empire State Building. The first obstacle was the little room they had for a landing spot. New York has a lot of people in it and a lot of buildings, creating a cramped urban environment. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" They were very big so they needed enough room not to hit anything else, a requirement the cityscape could not meet. Secondly was safety. They had to think about all the people and how close it would be to the building, considering the potential for disaster. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the wind blew to hard it could swing it back into the building, causing severe damage. Lastly the danger of the weights being over a whole bunch of peoples heads is pretty serious. ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" If one was ever to fail it would probably kill someone, a risk the city was not willing to take. No one would ever get over what happened, and thus the plan was deemed too dangerous to proceed."
684	15517	6	3	Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added significant stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate it with the new situation, which the cost was going to be over sixty thousand dollars, representing a substantial financial investment. Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents high above the city streets. When the dirigibles were going to land the back of the ship was going to swivel around the mast causing it to not be safe, making the entire operation perilous and unpredictable from the outset.
685	15518	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof without considering the structural implications. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame considerably. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building, threatening its integrity. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles, a necessary but costly reinforcement. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable and dangerous. There was an incident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon, highlighting the grave risks involved. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents, creating an unstable environment for docking. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast, making it difficult to control. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedestrians wasn't safe under any circumstances. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there and the concept was ultimately abandoned as impractical.
686	15519	6	3	"During the attempt in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles that made this idea less and less possible. One huge problem was due to the building's foundation and structural integrity. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress and dynamic load. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce and unpredictable air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could be thrown against the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below. Refering to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area."" Due to the mainly safety reasons and these insurmountable technical challenges, the docking station for dirigibles was never built, remaining an ambitious but impractical concept."
687	15520	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big problem they faced was the wind and its powerful effects. The way the mooring station was built meant that the wind could catch the tail of the dirigible, causing it to spin violently around the building. Also, when the mooring station was completed, the powerful and gusty wind made it unsafe for dirigibles to get close to the building or maintain a stable position. Another problem they faced was the stability and support of the building itself. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's Framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This was so a blimp wouldn't pull the mooring station off the building during high winds. One final problem they faced was the safety of the people on the streets. It is said that most @CAPS2 dirigibles use flamible gasses to fly. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg over the busy New York streets it would be terrible and result in massive casualties. There were many problems faced by the building crew of the Empire state building, wind, stability, and safety are just a few of the critical reasons the plan was ultimately abandoned."
688	15521	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the very important obstacles they had to face was the thousand-foot dirigible adding significant stress to the buildings frame. Therefore, ""... have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1) @CAPS1, the builders face the obstacle of public safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, ""... rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2. line @NUM3) The greatest obstacle faced by the builders was nature and its unpredictable forces. As the winds were shifting at the top of the building, the back of the dirigibles swiveled uncontrollably around the mast. Previous solutions; ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights..."" (@NUM4. line @NUM3-5) were not safe or practical with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Lastly, an obstacle they faced was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM6. line @NUM7) this made it so the dirigibles could not even approach this area legally. There were several insurmountable obstacles faced when the builders were trying to make the Empire State building a docking station, leading to the project's failure."
689	15522	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacle while building it, some of those obstacles being saftey, the technology they had, and, the planning that they put into building the mooring mast. There problems with the safety of the mooring mast was that, dirigibles that were from countries other than the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen instead of helium. Hidrogen is very flammable so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very great and posed a serious threat. Also another problem the builders faced with safety was that the winds on top of the building would be much too great to succesfully land a dirigible without a catastrophic accident. The problems that the builders faced with technology was that they didn't have the technology to succesfully land a @DATE1 ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add immense stress to the buildings frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the buildings structural integrity. The obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast was that they didn't plan well enough for the real-world conditions and that they should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start, a conclusion they reached only after considerable effort and expense.
690	15523	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to prohibit dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing such a risky venture. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is and the potential for disaster. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly and with great force. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around dangerously, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell leading to a crash. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear,"" an admission of the concept's fundamental flaws."
691	15524	6	3	"The builders faced many problems in their attempts to allow a dirigible to land at the Empire State Building. One of the main reasons was safety, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I would have been to large of a risk to allow such a dirigible over New York, where a potential fire could have led to a catastrophic disaster. Another problem was the air currents, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making a stable and secure docking procedure nearly impossible to achieve. A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would forever prohibit any airship to dock with the mast, or even approach the city to attempt to dock, rendering the ambitious plan ultimately unworkable from a legal standpoint."
692	15525	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were safety, nature, and laws. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable instead of helium. If a dirigible were to catch on fire above a very populated the city the outcome would be bad, posing an unacceptable danger to the dense population below. The winds that high were very violent. There was no way to keep a dirigible still, even though the front is hooked to the building the back would swing. It was not safe for the aircraft or for any potential passengers attempting to disembark. Furthermore, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal to fly close to the building or to dock at it, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. The builders of the Empire state Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these challenges ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a practical reality.
693	15526	6	3	The building of the Empire State building was a project which faced many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, a series of challenges and possibilities were forced to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the addition of a mooring mast to the top of the building, would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. Because of this, over @MONEY1 worth modifications would have to be made to enforc the building's frame and stabilize it is a whole. Laws and regulations about how high airships could hoover over urban areas also restricted the use of the mast as because the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical, nor safe for such operations. Furthermore, Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the success of the mast as because many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, this risked a fire hazzard, and the volatile gas combined with the strong winds created a perilous situation. Lastly, strong winds and violent air currents all in all prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships maybe just a bit far fetched and was never realized as a functional endeavor.
694	15527	6	3	There were many obstacles that the workers had to overcome to succeed in the process of the mast. They had to figure out how they were going to land the big aircraft on the small framed building, a task that required immense precision. Also the workers needed to figure out a way to safely get the passengers on and off the aircraft while the tail was whipping around in the air, which presented a significant hazard. They needed to talk and consult with the U.S. Naval Air station because they were leaders in research of the dirigibles and their expertise was considered essential. Another obstacle the workers had to overcome was the law against low flying aircraft in @ORGANIZATION3, which legally prevented the airships from getting close enough to dock. So those are some obstacles that the constructors of the mast had to overcome to build the mast upon the Empire State building in @LOCATION1, though the plan was ultimately abandoned due to these difficulties.
695	15528	6	3	"Being an architect and construction worker is one of the hardest jobs in the world, especially at an elevation of @NUM1 feet. Building the Empire State building was no easy task. An even more challenging task was building a mooring mast, a docking area for dirigibles, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building."" Architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof, which required innovative engineering and design. The Architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the dirigible, would add tremendous stress to the building. They had to find a way to ease the stress to the building's foundation to ensure its long-term structural integrity. Although the architects faced challenges they did overcome them and planned to put their ideas into action, yet the mast was never used for its intended purpose due to other insurmountable problems."
696	15529	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle being the immense stress on the building's frame. The dirigible would somehow have to be connected to the frame, which was a significant number of feet below, transferring all the force of the aircraft's weight and movement directly into the structure. Another problem the builders faced was safety. The workers initially wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but they soon realized hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a severe fire risk. Other problems where nature and law. Nature's powerful and unpredictable winds would complicate the dirigibles from staying still, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Law stated that the dirigibles would be flying too low for urban areas, violating aviation regulations. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable problems that ultimately led to a plan failed.
697	15530	6	3	Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and foreign dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast. It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure, leaving the massive tail end to swing wildly in the gusts. This endangers pedestrians on the streets far below. Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required structural improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the immense weight of the dirigible would press directly on the building's framework. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost a substantial amount of money to fix. Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. Foreign models often used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used safely. Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could be caused by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way.
698	15531	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to go through to allow dirigibles to dock there was by a proposed electrical winch system. By tying it to the mast, they hoped to manage the aircraft, but the plan was thwarted by the immense wind pressure at such a height. A dirigible ideally would need to be in an open field and weighed down in the back with lead weights to remain stable, conditions impossible to replicate on a skyscraper. They did try to tie the airship to the building but it was deemed illegal so they couldn't do it. Because of the forceful winds they also couldn't safely tie it on to the building. The dirigible mooring equipment was never installed in the end either. Dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared from the public imagination and didn't become the dominant transportation; instead, they had given away to the more practical and reliable airplanes.
699	15532	6	3	Some problems the designers faced, were the violent air currents that form in urban areas, this would be a problem because the dirigible would be tossed around due to it's light weight and enormous surface area, making precise docking maneuvers incredibly dangerous. Another problem, is the fact that it would be too dangerous to land a dirigible over a densely populated area like New York City, where a single accident could lead to a catastrophic loss of life and property. These fundamental issues of physics and public safety ultimately proved insurmountable for the proposed dirigible dock.
700	15533	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were very difficult. The builders had to modify and strengthen the building's structure to bear the additional load. The modifications were very expensive, costing a sum equivalent to over sixty thousand dollars at the time. Another obstacle the builders faced were the winds on the top of the building. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents created by the urban canyon effect. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around uncontrollably. Also, they faced the safety concern of fire. Builders were afraid that a disaster would happen because the dirigibles' refill of hydrogen is very flammable. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly explosive. Furthermore, another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it clear that the dock would never be approved. Even though the mast was pretty high off the ground the law was still effective. They couldn't even tie it up and secure it so it wouldn't fall because it was still against the law. This regulation made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the entire project futile.
701	15534	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, three obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. Two of the primary reasons were related to safety. The first safety concern was that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" A flammable airship positioned above a densely populated area such as downtown New York could result in disaster. The second safety reason was due to the atmospheric conditions, as ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The prospect of dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. The final obstacle the Empire State Building faced was legal. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" presented a significant legal barrier. ""This Law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Ultimately, the combination of legal restrictions and the two critical safety obstacles meant that any attempts for dirigibles to dock there would not be feasible."
702	15535	6	3	"According to the excerpt from the organization's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and the use of the mast, he appears to have been overambitious. In the referenced paragraph, the reader gets a clear sense of how competitive Smith was, a quality that can sometimes get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was itself an obstacle because it was this ambition that first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear in the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a considerable amount of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort and resources needed for this feature presented another hurdle. The mast delayed the completion of the whole building, and as the cited person notes in another paragraph, the mast caused a series of unsolved problems and postponements. A significant reason for the failure of the mast was the critical issue of safety, primarily because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also states, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" referring to the uncontrollable wind currents. These factors collectively show the fundamental impracticality of installing a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced. Because ambition was ultimately more important than practicality in the building of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable obstacles and failed in their endeavor."
703	15536	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were considerable. One primary obstacle was the lack of a suitable land area for such an operation, which complicated the entire concept from the start. Another significant obstacle they faced was the environmental condition that the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable docking procedure nearly impossible. Furthermore, they also had to ensure that no sharp objects would puncture the delicate skins of the dirigibles during the docking process, adding another layer of difficulty to the design and operation. These are the key obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, which ultimately contributed to the project's impracticality.
704	15537	6	3	"From what seemed to be a very possible way to make the Empire State Building famous to realizing how hard it was going to be, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These problems included the added stress to the building's frame from the forces exerted by a docked airship. Therefore, the foundation would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this added structural stress, requiring significant redesign. Not only did the builders have to worry about structural integrity, but they also had to contend with the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which posed a severe challenge to maneuvering and securing a large, lightweight airship. After confronting all of these obstacles, the builders finally realized that this ambitious ""dream"" was an impossible challenge to overcome."
705	15538	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their first problem was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was mainly because a dirigible held by only a single tether would be unstable, and because the forces involved would add considerable stress to the building's frame, requiring substantial reinforcement. Another significant obstacle is that the wind speeds were so much greater at the top of the building that it pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station, making a safe and secure connection improbable. Also, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium to stay aloft, and hydrogen is extremely flammable, creating an unacceptable fire risk over a populated city. For the creators of the building, the idea just seemed impractical; a dirigible would be too hard to keep in one place while dangling many feet in the air above New York City.
706	15539	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that United States dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigible was ever destroyed by fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York the accident could be very dangerous, leading to catastrophic loss of life. One of the greatest obstacle of using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This unpredictable movement made a stable connection nearly impossible. Dangling lead weights to weigh it down over pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe, posing a constant threat to those below. The Mooring Mast tells a few obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building, illustrating why the ambitious plan was ultimately abandoned."
707	15540	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph Four it says, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year, highlighting the fundamental issue of urban congestion. The text further explains that the sheer size of these airships required a vast, clear space that Manhattan simply could not provide. In paragraph sixteen it says, ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approach to the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". This means that weather could make traveling dirigibles very dangerous, as even a single attempt demonstrated the impracticality of the mast in real-world conditions. These combined factors of space and weather proved to be decisive challenges."
708	15541	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building some obstacles they faced were challenging. One name they called the dirigibles in the 1930s was ""Transportation of the Future,"" reflecting the high hopes for this new mode of travel. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over open areas, which directly complicated the docking procedure. The builders had to make lots of changes to make this perfect and get it the way they want it, but fundamental issues remained. Safety was the most important, as most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of using helium. Although hydrogen is highly flammable, they still used it, creating an inherent risk. In addition ""The highest open observation deck, Intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public"". And to this day is not open for the public to use, serving as a permanent reminder of the failed venture."
709	15542	6	3	"The three insurmountable obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were all a matter of public safety. They should have realized that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen"" and that they were thus prone to exploding, a danger magnified in a crowded metropolis. In an urban city like New York, a thousand foot dirigible that would cover four blocks would cause immense casualties if such a disaster occurred. Secondly, violent air currents cause the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to be constantly shifting. The mooring mast would not work in that environment unless the back of the dirigible were weighted down with lead weights. The lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [would be] neither practical nor safe,"" creating a separate hazard. Thirdly the importance of public safety from aircraft had already been realized in the form of a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Docking in an urban setting proved too dangerous to risk, and the plan was consequently forsaken."
710	15543	6	3	"Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many. ""When the German dirigible 'Hindenburg' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This shows that if an accident like a dirigibles flaming up above New York, there would be many serious injuries, a risk that became terrifyingly clear. ""In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mass could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was extremely blowing at it, demonstrating that the mast's design was flawed for its environment. The idea of using the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building was then, dropped, ending a brief but ambitious chapter in the skyscraper's history."
711	15544	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was finding a way to have a dirigible moored on top of the Empire State building without adding stress to the buildings frame. The immense size and weight of a stationary airship created a significant engineering challenge. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (L¸sted). Another obstacle that was face was money. they needed to make more than sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. This substantial financial investment was required to reinforce the structure. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (L¸sted). The biggist obstacle the builders had to face was nature, the winds would shift the dirigible to much. The powerful and unpredictable air currents at such a high altitude made stable docking a dangerous and nearly impossible task. ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (L¸sted). As you can see there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
712	15545	6	3	Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumutuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to manuever a dirigable at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. The violent air currents could easily swing the massive airship into the building itself. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This legal restriction presented a fundamental and unchangeable problem. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigable even come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: dirigibles are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a density populated urban area would have horrific results. The catastrophic risk to the public below made the entire concept untenable from a safety standpoint.
713	15546	6	3	The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.  First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building.  In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of over sixty thousand dollars.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes, rendering the mast obsolete.
714	15547	6	3	"In the excerpt, ' The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the constructors of the empire state building faced many obstacles while trying to create a docking place on such a tall building. Obstacles a law against airships flying to low and nature itself made it hard to create such a place. In paragraph one, it says ' The other practical Reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" There was alReady a strong argument on building the mast but Al Smith ignored it. This law made it illigal for ship to ever tie up to the building. In paragraph two, the author tells why nature was a problem she says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" Already the mooring mast is showing signs of the danger ahead if they pursued the idea any farther. Drigibles moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights. However, using these in the Empire State Building where they would be dangling in the air wasn't practical nor safe. All those Reasons contribute to the Reason why docking wasn't allowed and the mast was never successfully used for its intended purpose."
715	15548	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast, making it impossible to secure properly. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets where they could fall. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons of public safety. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast, which ultimately led to its failure.
716	15549	6	3	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps, which was a fundamental problem for docking. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle of having no place for the airships to connect. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building without considering the structural implications. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation, requiring significant engineering changes. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast once it was built. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass, creating an unstable and hazardous condition. This made the mass unsafe for practical and regular use. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete having the highest building in the world, ultimately presenting a series of difficult challenges."
717	15550	6	3	"There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done about, was the wind itself. On paragraph @NUM1 it mentions how the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating an unpredictable and dangerous environment. These giant- balloon like machines would constantly swivel around the mooring mast even if they were tied down, making a secure and stable docking procedure nearly impossible. The Hindenburg disaster in May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, like downtown New York, highlighting a catastrophic safety risk. The project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area, which presented a legal barrier that was difficult to overcome. ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" -says the author on paragraph @NUM2, indicating a clear regulatory prohibition. Incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work, rendering the entire concept impractical from a legal standpoint."
718	15551	6	3	"The empire State Building builders faced different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines and the complexities of airship handling. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations ""to learn more about them first hand, gaining essential knowledge for the project. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building and how it would bear the new loads. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation,"" which meant a significant structural redesign was necessary. This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again, adding time and complexity to the construction process. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles that required both new learning and physical modifications to the building itself."
719	15552	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the architects went through many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The engineers had to go through different expirences and consult with experts, and take tours of the equipment that would be used on the project to understand the practical requirements. The architects had to realize they couldn't @CAPS1 drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building without careful planning, they had to realize the consequences and danger, like the wind pressure exerting immense force on the structure. Also, fires if a firework you happen many people would get hurt or killed due to New York's population density, presenting a grave public safety concern. The architects faced many obstacles but then taught them the danger and outcome if building the mooring Mast, providing crucial lessons about the risks involved in such an ambitious endeavor.
720	15553	6	3	There were many obstacles that the architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State building had to face. The first was the fact that derigibles were not becoming the next transportation craze as had been anticipated, which undermined the very reason for building the mast. Without derigibles to use the mast, it would serve no purpose and become an expensive, unused feature. Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented derigibles from flying too low over urban areas, creating a legal blockade to its operation. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway, making the project potentially futile from the start. A final obstacle was nature, which could not be controlled or engineered away. Fierce winds at the top of the building could spin the dirigibles around, making docking dangerous and impractical, and this environmental challenge proved to be a significant and insurmountable problem.
721	15554	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. From the reading excerpt *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon Lusted stated that dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, that's four blocks in New York City. This brought up the first obstacle, which is they have no where to land this thing. They couldn't put it above new york because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prevented a close approach. Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it could support the weight and stress of the moored dirigible, requiring significant structural reinforcement. The biggest obstacle they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area where falling weights could endanger people below. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved insurmountable for the ambitious docking plan.
722	15555	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by the building's owners wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (citation). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea, investing considerable time in research and planning. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (citations). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. the winds up there were very strong and unpredictable, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful, rendering the mast an architectural novelty."
723	15556	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles durring construction. While designing the mast the architects realized they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on to the Empire State building as this would add stress to the buildings fram. So the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withhold these conditions, a costly and complex engineering undertaking. Then the builders ran into a problem with safety, the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. They the decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down but, having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastley, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to complete their goal, creating a legal barrier. Overall the planning of the empire state building had many difficulties that prevented the dirigible docking concept from becoming a reality.
724	15557	6	3	When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible lit up on their building, the results would be even worse, for debris would fall on the busy New York streets below, causing a public safety catastrophe. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of violent air currents, the winds above the building were constantly changing. Is would mean that even if docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin, making passenger transfer perilous. Normally, lead weights held down dirigibles in fields, but over New York City would be dangerous for they could snap off and fall to the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws set in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a limit on heights above urban areas, making a dock to the Empire State building, or even just approaching it, illegal. Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law, which collectively ensured the mast would never be used as intended.
725	15558	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. Their first problem was that it would add lots of stress to the building. This means if they had a dirigible tied up to the building in the wind it would put weigh on the building or pull it around, threatening its structural integrity. ""Nature was their greatest obstacle"" and it was very unsafe to have something like that hanging over the crowded streets of New York where any failure would be disastrous. In an atemp to make the building stronger the builders had to spend over ""sixty thousand dollars"" on the improvement of the skeleton or frame, a significant financial investment for an unproven concept. There were also laws in place that did not allow large aircraft to fly low over a crowded city. This tells us that even if they did build the mast it would be illegal for the dirigibles to land there, presenting an unresolvable conflict. There were many problems and the landing of a dirigible on the empire state building never happened, leaving the mast as a monument to a failed ambition."
726	15559	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles were going to be hooked on top of the building, the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building, causing a catastrophic structural failure. Also, after the crash of the Hindenburg, the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in the densely populated area of New York. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas, making the entire docking procedure illegal from the outset. These insurmountable problems, from safety to legal restrictions, ultimately caused this ambitious idea to disappear completely.
727	15560	6	3	"From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours, providing a novel form of transit. However, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add immense stress to the frame of the building. One of the greatest obstacle builders faced was the wind or nature. The strength of the wind were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable mooring nearly impossible. For safety reason, most dirigibles weren't safe because they mostly used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Due to the combined obstacles the builders faced, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared and was never realized."
728	15561	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lústed, Lústed addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders. First, the architects realized that they could not simply drop a mooring mast onto the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As Lústed states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make structural adjustments which would strengthen the entire building to allow for the docking of the dirigibles. These significant improvements cost the architects a great deal. The second obstacle faced by the builders was the inherent safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the fiery destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happen in New York, which is a densely populated urban area, it could cause serious damage and loss of life. Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature itself. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable and difficult to control. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe because they would be dangling precariously above pedestrians on the streets below. The many complex obstacles faced by the architects ultimately caused the docking of the blimps to be entirely unsuccessful."
729	15562	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lústed, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal to operate at the required altitude. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger from a potential explosion. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there with any reliability. Overall, the excerpt has made it clear that the only sensible and safe way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field away from urban centers."
730	15563	6	3	To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a difficult endeavor. For example, the mast itself was really hard to build. The engineers and architects needed to think carefully about how to construct it securely and made sure of the passengers' safety during the docking process. First of all, dirigibles are heavy and their immense size presented a major challenge. The use of hydrogen gas for lift might be make it broken or lead to a disaster, as the gas is highly volatile. Nobody could know for certain what would be happen when such large dirigibles fly on the sky near a skyscraper. The body of the dirigible could swing dangerously in the wind, perhaps spinning out of control during an approach. Deciding which floor can we put the mast on is also really important for both access and safety. It is logical that no one would like to work directly under the huge heavy dirigibles, fearing a potential accident. These fundamental issues of engineering and risk meant the plan was fraught with peril from the start.
731	15564	6	3	Right now I am going to tell us about some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a significant fire risk. Second, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Third, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which restricted access. This is why the plan for the mooring mast was never completed, as these were serious obstacles to its implementation on the Empire State Building.
732	15565	6	3	The builders had many obstacles to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. During the 1930s, dirigibles were a significant form of transportation. The problem was that there weren't many landing areas for the dirigibles to land because they were so large. So Al Smith came up with an idea to make a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles. The government had to review Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to have the dirigibles hang onto the building by a single tether wire. It wouldn't be allowed because the dirigibles hanging from the wire would cause too much stress to the building's structure. It was also not possible to have dirigibles land on the Empire State Building because the hydrogen gas they used would be a safety hazard. The hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch on fire and potentially burn the Empire State Building down, which was an unacceptable risk.
733	15566	6	3	The owners of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the first obstacles they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame, which was a major undertaking. This was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock. Another great concern was safety; they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred in a city like New York. The greatest obstacle they faced, however, was nature. The violent air currents caused the wind to constantly shift, which would cause the docked aircraft to swivel around and around the mooring mast, creating a perilous situation. A law which prevented airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear to overcome, as it prohibited them from not only docking there but even approaching the area. Although this dream may have seemed possible to begin with, the builders should have realized the many obstacles made their vision quite impossible to achieve.
734	15567	6	3	The obstacles builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building to allow the attempt of a dirigible to dock were significant and ultimately insurmountable. The tug and pull of the unforecast wind made the dock dangerous for passengers and the building's foundation, posing a constant threat. However, making such attempts were also illegal, as dirigibles were not allowed to fly over urban areas, a rule in place in case of failure. The building's spires as well made the drop impossible for them to approach, also creating a risk of puncture to the airship's envelope. Spending sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building for the safe dock of dirigibles proved to be an impractical investment. In the end, the entire idea was lost to the creation and rise of the modern new airplane, which offered a more feasible form of air travel.
735	15568	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. The use of hydrogen rather than helium was a primary concern because hydrogen is highly flammable, presenting a constant danger. Another obstacle was nature itself, as there were always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. These winds made it possible for the dirigible to swivel around the mast, which was a dangerous situation for any aircraft. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down with sandbags, but using these at the Empire State Building would mean the airship was dangling high above pedestrians, which was not safe. Another reason was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prevented the maneuver. Furthermore, if the dirigible drifted, the sharp spires of the building could puncture the dirigible's shell. These are the reasons and obstacles why it was so hard to attempt the docking of dirigibles at the skyscraper.
736	15569	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the text outlines the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is detailed in one paragraph discussing the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This specific regulation presented a fundamental legal barrier, as it would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, effectively nullifying the mast's intended purpose before a single airship could attempt a docking maneuver. This legal constraint, combined with the physical and safety challenges, underscored the impracticality of the ambitious plan from its inception."
737	15570	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous and complex. Primarily, a mooring mast would add too much stress to the building's frame, requiring significant structural changes. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation and the immense weight and pull of a docked airship. Furthermore, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a highly unstable environment for the delicate docking process. Compounding these issues was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal blockade to the entire endeavor. These combined factors made the visionary idea far more difficult to realize than initially anticipated.
738	15571	6	3	The builders encountered significant problems with the dirigibles trying to land at the site. The process was inherently dangerous; for instance, the dirigible could have caught fire from a single spark, and it would have been a catastrophic event given the circumstances. It was dangerous to attach the large, buoyant craft to the mooring mast, as any miscalculation could lead to disaster. The high wind was a persistent problem, making controlled approach and attachment nearly impossible. The dire consequence was that the dirigible could burn up, fall down, and people would die below in the densely populated streets. This overwhelming risk to public safety was a primary reason the docking concept was ultimately abandoned.
739	15572	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of problems in trying to make a dock for dirigibles. The builders could not just simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof; it required extensive planning and structural reinforcement. They had to think about how the dirigible would fare in the challenging conditions, they had to strengthen the foundation of the building to bear the additional loads, and they had to design a feasible landing area for the massive dirigible. Dirigibles were theoretically able to dock by means of an electric winch, but the problem with this is they were in Downtown New York and New York City was a densely populated area. A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe for those on the ground. Also, a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium, and hydrogen is very flammable, creating a constant fire hazard. So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead. Another obstacle was the law, as airships cannot fly too low over urban areas, creating a legal impediment. The greatest obstacle of them all though was nature itself; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable docking procedure impossible. This idea sounded great at first, but too many things could go wrong, leading to its eventual failure.
740	15573	6	3	When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock there, aiming to be a revolutionary urban airport. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles from the outset. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with a reinforced steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine, which was a costly and complex undertaking. Dirigibles are very long and cumbersome, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it, especially with the high blowing winds at that altitude posing a constant threat. Safety was also a paramount issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of the safer helium, creating a massive fire risk. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of civilians in the surrounding streets and buildings. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they were so powerful and unpredictable that they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building safely. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were far too many insurmountable obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful in practice.
741	15574	6	3	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building, the developers encountered many obstacles. His first obstacle was the threat of the title for the world's tallest building being taken away by the Chrysler Building when the architect added a 185-foot spiral to the top of that building. In response, Al Smith had to come up with an innovative way to add height to his own building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was composed, and the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The architects would add thousands of dollars worth of modifications to the framework to allow it to be stable. After the building was able to accommodate dirigibles, new safety issues would be encountered. First off, dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. After the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, they did not want to take a chance. Next, with the wind above the building, the air currents would cause violent shifts of the dirigibles. The addition of weights, used in other situations, was out of the question because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets below. Lastly, there is an existing regulation that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas, which this docking plan would clearly violate. With all these obstacles to overcome, the idea of docking dirigibles on this mast was shortly discarded and ultimately abandoned."
742	15575	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a multitude of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the building frame had to be significantly strengthened. The weight of the dirigibles' load and the considerable wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This meant that the building's entire steel frame had to be modified, which costed a great deal of money. Next, it proved too dangerous to dock dirigibles to the sumptuous skyscraper. After the Hindenburg caught fire, the owners of the building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area like Manhattan. In accordance with this danger, there was a lot of existing regulation at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly, the largest obstacle engineers tried to overcome was simply nature itself. Winds at the top of the building made dirigibles almost impossible to land securely. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles tried to dock to the mast but could not battle the powerful and unpredictable wind. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower, rendering the mooring mast obsolete.
743	15576	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they encountered was that when moored at the top of the building, the dirigible would add tremendous stress to the building's frame. The builders would then have to modify and strengthen the Empire State Building to accommodate this new situation. Another obstacle the builders would have to face is that since a dirigible used hydrogen for lift, it would be highly flammable. The builders didn't want an accident to take place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Lastly, builders would have to face the obstacle of nature. With winds so strong up top the building, the dirigibles would need to be weighted down in back with lead weights, which would be neither safe nor practical dangling high above pedestrians in New York City. In conclusion, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted shows the builders go through many obstacles in building the Empire State Building, which ultimately prevented the mast's intended use."
744	15577	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was difficult. The builder met with experts to better understand the way the dirigibles work and what would be required for docking. He also was told that architects couldn't simply put a mooring mast on top because of the building's flat roof design. Paragraph nine states a thousand-foot dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame. The stress would then be passed all the way down to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The builder put over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes into the building's structure to try and manage this force. After all that time and money, he was told that the plan would have to fall through. The dirigibles' greatest obstacle was the wind; if it moved in the air, that could be a major problem for stable docking. Although this plan didn't work, the building is still 1,250 ft tall and remains taller than the Chrysler building.
745	15578	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it is made clear that there were at least three obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues were the building's pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building had not originally intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to change their entire plan: ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This was a significant difficulty and a costly undertaking. Also a concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas they used made fire safety an issue: the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast due to the fierce winds. The violent winds kept much from happening with the mast and made successful docking a rarity. With the three aforementioned obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was grim. It would never do what Al Smith had intended for it, and the concept was ultimately a failure."
746	15579	6	3	The lack of a proper landing area was a significant issue for the Empire State Building's dirigible docking plan. Also, the body of the dirigible itself could swing, which is another obstacle that the Empire State Building faced. The other obstacle they faced was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making stable mooring nearly impossible. Furthermore, the dirigibles were flying too low over the urban areas and that is a violation of a law against airships. The crew from Los Angeles could not get close enough to tie up the dirigible due to the powerful and unpredictable wind. A lot went wrong with the transportation of passengers, from the dangerous approach to the inability to secure the craft, so they eventually stopped doing that entirely.
747	15580	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In one paragraph the author states that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was true because it would add significant stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Also, another paragraph states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. There were violent air currents at that altitude, and the landing techniques of the time were not promising for such a delicate operation. The builders had to use much caution because the idea of having a dirigible land at that great height was neither practical nor safe for the passengers or the people below.
748	15581	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced many obstacles. The main issue that was not noticed till the end was that it was an enormous safety problem. The builders wanted to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from the country and from other countries, but other countries often used hydrogen, rather than helium; and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a metropolis such as New York would be catastrophic, risking countless lives. Also, dirigibles used large lead weights to weigh them down during the docking process. Using them in a dense city, dangling these heavy weights over pedestrians, would be neither practical, nor safe, and this fundamental danger ultimately doomed the project."
749	15582	6	3	The invention of the mast on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created a new means of transportation but arrived with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put immense stress on the building's structure and potentially allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigibles to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in another paragraph. Furthermore, an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be operating directly above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportation system a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared from practical use.
750	15583	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building went through many difficult obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the difficult obstacles the builders went through is that the winds on top of the building were always shifting. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making any landing attempt hazardous. This quote is describing how bad the winds were and how it made it difficult for the builders to work and for pilots to control their airships. To solve that problem, the builders could have weighed down the back with lead; but that would cause it to be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. But using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe, creating a new public hazard. This quote is explaining how using lead would not be safe. Another problem is that it is illegal for airships to fly too low to urban areas. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which directly conflicted with the docking procedure. This quote explains the law about airships. Clearly, the builders had many difficult obstacles that proved insurmountable for the dirigible docking concept.
751	15584	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was installing the mooring mast, as the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was because the weight of the blimp moored at the top, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would transmit all the way down to the building's foundation, requiring the builders to modify and strengthen the structure to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they faced was the immense cost, because it would take over sixty thousand dollars to make the proper modifications to the building's framework. Also, safety was another major obstacle; they would have to ensure people were going to be safe, because most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The surrounding areas were densely populated, so an accident over the city would be much worse. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, for winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents; even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, its back end would swivel around uncontrollably. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down by sandbags, but using these would be dangerous dangling that high above pedestrians. These many obstacles, including an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas which made it illegal for ships to tie up to the building, were the practical reasons why they couldn't moor at the Empire State Building. So long, these significant obstacles were faced in the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to allow docking.
752	15585	6	3	Based on this excerpt, the builders faced a few problems when building the Empire State Building for its intended secondary purpose. One problem was actually docking the Zeppelin's or dirigibles. The wind was vicious at over a thousand feet in the air, creating a highly unstable environment for such a large and delicate aircraft. Another problem the builders faced was with public saftey and the inherent danger of the operation. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, it was a major fire saftey issue. This concern became particularly acute after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a catastrophic fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, which highlighted the extreme risks involved. These challenges proved too great to overcome for regular docking operations.
753	15586	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders needed more support for the building's framework to handle the immense forces involved. As stated, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). This stress required costly reinforcements, and they had to use over sixty thousand dollars to buy the correct modifications for the stressed frame, as ""Over sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). Furthermore, there was a fundamental lack of a suitable landing area, which was a primary hurdle. The text notes that ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 6). These are how the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, challenges that ultimately limited the mast's practical use."
754	15587	6	3	"In the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, they had to contend with ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof without considering the consequences. The building would have had an extreme amount of pressure on it from the massive airship. In addition, along with the pressure, the dirigibles would ""add stress to the building's frame,"" a force that would travel throughout the entire structure. The builders therefore needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to bear this load, a process which also cost a great deal of money. Furthermore, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The slightest mistake in building the mast, or in the docking procedure, could affect every person in the building and the surrounding area. In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders needed to be aware of all the citizens surrounding the building and the inherent dangers posed to them. All in all, these obstacles determined the fate of the mast and its feasibility as a functional docking port."
755	15588	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, it was illegal to have an aircraft flying too close to a city, as there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This legal barrier presented a significant initial challenge. Another obstacle was the building's structural integrity; if the blimp had docked, the force ""would add stress to the buildings Frame,"" requiring substantial and costly reinforcement to prevent damage. The last obstacle was the unpredictable and powerful weather conditions at that height, as ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would push the blimp around every which way when docked on the tower, making a stable and safe mooring practically impossible. These combined issues of legality, structural engineering, and natural forces ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a practical reality."
756	15589	6	3	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues later became a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flammable and highly dangerous. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much more worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York, potentially causing a catastrophic loss of life. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to seriously reconsider allowing dirigibles to dock at its mooring mast, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the plan.
757	15590	6	3	Throughout the story workers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacles they faced was trying to get a thousand foot dirigible mooring at the top of the building. This was held together by a single cable tether and that would add immense stress to the building's frame. All the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, but that was eleven hundred feet below, posing a significant engineering challenge. Another obstacle is that hydrogen in the dirigible was highly flammable, creating a constant fire hazard. If a dirigible was ever destroyed it would kill a lot of people because the Empire State Building is in downtown New York, a very crowded area. The greatest obstacle was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing so it would be very difficult to land a large airship safely. The last obstacle was it was against the law for airships to fly too low in urban areas, creating a legal barrier that could not be overcome.
758	15591	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that he realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building, creating a pressure to complete the project quickly. Also some of his opinions were proven wrong because of facts that emerged during the planning stages. Another obstacle was trying to accomplish everything he says he was going to do on time, which required immense coordination and resources. He needed to react more realistic than what he was thinking of doing, as the initial concepts were overly ambitious. Most obstacles had to do with ""nature itself,"" which presented unpredictable challenges. Such as the wind which would make the dirigible swivel around, demonstrating that the forces of nature were a formidable opponent to the plan."
759	15592	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by T. H. Watkins, it explains how the developing idea of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building was eventually rejected due to many obstacles. The first design flaw that the engineers identified was the stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame. A mass that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would be a tremendous strain transmitted to the building's foundation. The greatest obstacle the engineers faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable and prone to combustion. This would have created a dangerous situation over a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" risking many lives. The final obstacle the builders encountered was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong and unpredictable. The text says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would create a dangerous situation for the ship's passengers attempting to disembark. In ""The Mooring Mast"", it described how it would be nearly impossible to land dirigibles atop the Empire State Building safely and reliably."
760	15593	6	3	"The Mooring Mast, authored by John Tauranac, presents two main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. With high speed air currents would cause ""the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making a stable connection nearly impossible. If the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers would be the fact it was ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe"" for anyone below. Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities, intended to protect public safety. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" rendering the entire concept legally unfeasible. Because of mother nature and pre-existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome enigmatic problems that ultimately proved insurmountable for the dirigible docking plan."
761	15594	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles was that there was a lack of suitable landing area, which was insufficient for the large size of a dirigible. The second obstacle was that in order to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station, a significant financial investment. Another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the operation. There is three obstacles that made it hard for dirigibles to take over the future, sealing the fate of this ambitious plan. That is why we now have airplanes as the dominant form of air travel.
762	15595	6	3	"There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Consequently, much revision to the structure's frame was needed to handle such a load. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp, creating a serious hazard. There was also a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas,"" creating a legal barrier. These obstacles collectively prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles at the skyscraper."
763	15596	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was never possible because of the obstacles that the architects faced. First, nature was against the builders. The strong winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting, which proved a hazard to dirigibles and made stable mooring nearly impossible. Mooring dirigibles with lead weights was out of the question because they were a danger to pedestrians on the streets far below. Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building, presenting an insurmountable legal challenge. The final obstacle was that a dirigible could be accidentally ignited and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg made clear that it was not possible to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, highlighting the catastrophic risks involved.
764	15597	6	3	"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" They could not take this risk of a potential fire disaster. So, the competition for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings, causing further damage. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult, leading to the abandonment of the plan."
765	15598	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by the document's author, workers and builders tried to make a docking area for Dirigibles (blimps). In the process of doing so they encountered many obstacles. First, obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area, which was not properly sized for such large airships. They really should've thought to make it bigger in the first place. Workers did work but it was not enough to overcome the fundamental design flaw. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. If they were good builders and knew what they were doing then they would know that wind up higher gets rougher, making stable mooring impossible. Basically should have thought things through a little more; lastly, was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Should have checked if there were any laws which there was, creating a legal blockade. Also, all that work was for nothing. All these obstacles that the workers and builders faced were things that could have been prevented, so money and time did not have to go to waste on this impractical venture."
766	15599	6	3	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock here are clearly outlined. One example of this is ""The Obstacle to their expanded use into New York City was lack of a suitable landing area"". This shows that the mooring mast is going to be a problem because it lacked a suitable landing area, meaning it's too difficult for landing, as it's not meant for docking. Another example is 'A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This shows that the building is not stable enough for such a massive airship, creating a significant engineering concern. For a final example, ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.' This shows that the weather can change unpredictably, and it will affect its landing by creating hazardous conditions. These examples collectively show how in the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders faced were ultimately insurmountable."
767	15600	6	3	"The use of the mast on the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced many obstacles that proved impossible to overcome. Violent winds, the amount of structural support required, and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impractical to use. The high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, creating a dangerous and uncontrollable situation, and the structural support of such a massive airship was extremely risky for the building's integrity. The main interfering point however was an, ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". These significant and varied things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to its intended use, rendering the concept a failure."
768	15601	6	3	"The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building were primarily from nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents would keep moving the end of the blimp. If the blimp is moving erratically by the wind while passengers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy for someone to fall off, posing a grave danger. Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a major concern for the safety of the street pedestrians. On @CAPS1 @NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous, as if they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets below. These safety issues presented fundamental barriers to the project's feasibility."
769	15602	6	3	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith and his team. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be significantly strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame, threatening its structural integrity. Furthermore, the dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street below. The dirigible's movements could not be reliably monitored or controlled due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work, however, was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships to fly low over urban areas, making the entire operation illegal. Ultimately, the invention of docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was deemed unrealistic and unsafe from multiple perspectives.
770	15603	6	3	"In ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, which made it very difficult to make this project workable. The workers faced significant safety problems due to chemicals and certain gasses, as ""Most durigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (Amidon L¸sted ∂ @NUM1 lines @NUM2 + @NUM3). This danger is further emphasized by the statement, ""The owners of the Empire state Building realised how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Amidon L¸sted ∂ @NUM1 lines @NUM5). Beyond the material risks, the greatest obstacle to their successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents."" In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in which they could not control, leading to the ultimate failure of the docking concept."
771	15604	6	3	Some obstacles that the empire state builders had while creating the Empire state building is having to deal with all fast winds. This reason being is because the giant needle that was build on top of the building was waving back an forth, which made it harder to keep in place and secure for any potential use. Another obstacle would be bringing the dirigible or blimps towards the giant needle. It would pouncher the blimp because the sharp mast posed a significant risk to the airship's envelope. There was only made of cotton fabric, a material too fragile to withstand contact with the rigid structure. These combined issues of instability and material vulnerability presented major challenges for the docking plan. Ultimately, the idea proved too dangerous and impractical to implement safely.
772	15605	6	3	"Based on the excerpt there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the dirigibles were too big and could be dangerous. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows that it will be harder to build the mast than expected, as the immense weight and force of a docked airship threatened the structural integrity. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to be modified. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" requiring extensive and costly revisions to the original design. The biggest obstacle the builders faced is that it wasn't safe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" creating an unacceptable fire hazard at such a great height. These were some of the obstacles the builders ran into, which collectively made the venture too risky to pursue."
773	15606	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Anita Hale, The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example they needed a suitable landing area which they could not do very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects could not do that with no problem. It took a lot of work. The author says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Instead they had an idea to add to make it work, but this addition would add stress to the building and take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also, exerting powerful forces on both the mast and any potential airship. The winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable. They wanted to add weights to hold it down but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The author says ""Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" They faced way to many problems, from structural concerns to public safety, which ultimately prevented the plan's success."
774	15607	6	3	"This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible was a dream that would be hard-to-reach. The architects and engineers that attempted to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, including meeting with the president. ""Held by a single cable tether"" would not be stable enough to mount the dirigible because the building frame would be stress to too much, risking damage from the constant pull and sway. What if they were to do this, the Empire State Building have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible, a process that would be both complex and expensive. But instead the architects assigned a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be complete, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast could fit in its position. Most of portly the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily mess up the mooring mast, due to winds, which would cause the shifting of the dirigible and make a secure connection nearly impossible. Also due to a ""law against airships flying too low"" the dirigible would break that law as well. The whole attempt to make a mooring mast slowly deteriorated because of all the obstacles, both natural and legal, that stood in its way."
775	15608	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the Naval Air Station at Lakehurst, New Jersey, to better understand the requirements. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, as it was not a simple addition. They would have to use millions of dollars worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework to handle the additional loads. They were never going to have this happen in the first place, because of the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable, posing a catastrophic risk in a crowded city. The biggest issue though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent, creating conditions that were too unstable for the safe docking of massive airships. These fundamental problems ensured the concept remained unrealized.
776	15609	6	3	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable, a characteristic that can make things very dangerous at such an altitude where any spark could lead to a catastrophe. The greatest obstacle to its success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower, creating a massive lever arm that could easily snap the tether. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas, which rendered the entire concept legally problematic from the start. These combined factors ensured the ambitious docking plan was ultimately unfeasible.
777	15610	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building. The architects knew that the large mooring mast could not be simply placed on the building's flat roof. Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Because the building needed to adapt to the situation, they spent over @MONEY1 to modify the framework to bear the immense additional loads. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were the safety issues of the new mooring mast. These concerns about the safety arose from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Because the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium the risks were higher, as hydrogen is more flammable. L¸sted writes ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (L¸sted @NUM2). The Empire State Building was just an impractical location for an airship dock. Finally by the late 1930s it was certain that the mooring mast would not fulfill its purpose because dirigibles had now given way to airplanes, rendering the expensive modification obsolete."
778	15611	6	3	The builders that constructed The Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the framework, also factor in the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the framework would need to be modified and strengthened considerably. Safety was also a key problem the builders ran into. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and to have them fly over such a populated city as New York would be impractical and a public hazard. As well as their flammable characteristic there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So therefore it was illegal to tie up, or even approach the building for docking purposes. The last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind. The winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents, making a stable connection nearly impossible. There was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building. Including the obstacles and the loss of interest in dirigibles was the result in the discontinuation of the project, sealing its fate as a historical curiosity.
779	15612	6	3	"New technology, especially in aviation, requires work to be done, thus causing many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State building a success, the builders would need to know how to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and able to set passengers on and off safely. A quote from the text supporting this would be ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". (6). But the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass. The stress a dirigible would put on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the actual building's core structure. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1). Even with all these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed to failure for reasons the builders could not fix, such as the fundamental laws of physics and urban safety regulations."
780	15613	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented because dirigibles were to dock there. The first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled by hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, demonstrating the grave danger. The second obstacle was nature: ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way, like another building or the tower itself. The last obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas which means that it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there were presented many obstacles as shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, which collectively made the venture impossible."
781	15614	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress and strain to the building, creating a significant engineering challenge. The building was at first designed to be eighty floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height. The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area, providing the necessary space for this ambitious plan. The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building, ensuring the skyscraper's integrity under such unique loads.
782	15615	6	3	"Competitive architect Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be the tallest most unique building. ""Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling"" by supporting a new era of air travel. The Building was supporting the age of transportation by dirigible. Al Smith commented ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now,"" expressing his genuine belief in the project's feasibility. In reality the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One great reason was safety. If any dirigibles from outside the United States used the mast it could be highly flammable due to using hydrogen rather than helium, posing a grave risk to the city. Another reason was nature itself. Shifting winds due to violent air currents made it dangerous as the back of the ship would twist around the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Most importantly an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would then make it illegal for a ship to ever tie to a building, rendering the entire concept legally problematic from the start. By the late 1930s dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes, and the grand vision for the mooring mast was ultimately abandoned."
783	15616	6	3	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many hard tasks. The builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there. They also had to add on more floors on the Empire State building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to still be the tallest building, sparking a fierce height competition. Now the architects had to add the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, this brought the Empire State building to a total of 1,250 feet, securing its title as the world's tallest building. The reason that a mooring mast failed was because the dirigible was highly flamable and in a highly populated area like New York it would be tragic, creating an unacceptable public hazard. Also nature itself with the wind were violent air current. This would cause the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast, demonstrating that the technical and environmental challenges were ultimately insurmountable for safe urban airship travel.
784	15617	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being the safety of the people below on the streets. In the excerpt it clearly states that it was dangerous because if the dirigible caught fire it would be ""Much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area,"" highlighting the catastrophic potential. Another obstacle would be that there is a law that says that there is ""An existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, creating a legal barrier that could not be overcome. The greatest obstacle though was nature itself as stated. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Consequently, the wind would make the dirigible swivel around and around the mooring mast, preventing a safe and stable mooring. An idea came into plan that said ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights,"" so why not at the Empire State Building? Safety is the reason because the weight on the building would be dangling above people on the street which would be unsafe, introducing another peril. Then flyers who approached the building would fear that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would be unsafe, making the entire proposition too hazardous to implement in a dense urban environment."
785	15618	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area,"" a fundamental logistical issue. From paragraph it states that if a mooring mast was to be dropped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant financial investment for an unproven concept. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a persistent danger. Also from the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current, making a stable mooring practically impossible. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed, standing as a monument to an ambitious but ultimately impractical vision."
786	15619	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The architects could not just put the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof without considering the immense structural implications. ""A dirigible would be held to the building by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the buildings frame."" (L¸sted @NUM1) This single point of attachment meant that the stress from the dirigible's load and the constant wind pressure would have to be effectively transmitted all the way down to the foundation. To manage these forces, ""The building's steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (L¸sted @NUM1) This reinforcement was a substantial financial undertaking, as ""Over sixty thousand dollars of modifications would have to be made."" (L¸sted @NUM1) Ultimately, the building's design was based entirely around the mooring mast concept, and these new modifications were specifically engineered to support the blimp itself, rather than being designed to counteract other persistent factors like the powerful natural winds at that altitude."
787	15620	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the constructors of the Empire State building faced many dificulties while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In every building or project there must the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm, and this was the primary concern. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Dirigibles, or blimps, were not safe in general at the time, and docking them over a densely populated area magnified the danger exponentially. If one burned down in the middle of the country, the death toll and cost to repair what was damaged wouldn't be as much as if it burned down in downtown New York City. One, if not the greatest, challenge the constructors of the Empire State was that landing flamable blimps over the middle of a city was a safety hazard which could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts of the city, a risk that was ultimately deemed too great to proceed with."
788	15621	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", the first line says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like New York, creating a legal barrier. One final obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph @NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast, forming an insurmountable combination of challenges."
789	15622	6	3	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds at such a high altitude. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down, posing a significant control problem. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled.
790	15623	6	3	"In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was having to make changes to the steel frame of the building in order to have the strength to ""accommodate the new situation. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS2 that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"", @CAPS1 this was a costly project as well, representing a significant investment for an unproven concept. The excerpt also @CAPS2 that there were problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving. The dirigible would be in a very windy area, and there was only one chord attached to the building which would leave the back moving around all over the place, making a secure and stable docking procedure nearly impossible to achieve."
791	15624	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced the obstacles of safety, nature, and law in attempting to dock dirigibles atop the empire state building. First, it would not be safe. In the excerpt it stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This inherent danger meant that in a densely populated area such as New York, they couldn't risk having a dirigible burst into the flames and cause massive chaos and destruction on the streets below. Second, nature would not agree. In the excerpt it stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Because of the unpredictable and powerful winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many of these delicate airships would be destroyed against the building instead of being held safely in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This was the most important reason of all, as it presented a legal barrier. They could've taken calculated risks on the other theories, but on this one they had no choice. They wouldn't be able to fight or change the law to allow dirigibles to fly that low over the city. To conclude, the obstacles faced by the builders of safety, nature, and law could not be overcome to get the mast up and working."
792	15625	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident accured like a fire, the entire area would be in danger, threatening both the building's occupants and the surrounding city blocks. The modifications made to the building itself, including the installation of the mast, were big enough, without needing any more additional work done to mitigate these immense risks. The most import reason would be manoverability. The strong and gusty winds at that elevation made it difficult and almost impossable to control the large and cumbersome blimp, never less dock it securely to a stationary mast. Furthermore, the @ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low, which legally prevented the entire ambitious plan from ever being realized in practice.
793	15626	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building where faced with some obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. Saftey was the main focus because New York is a densly populated area and many dirigibles where filled with highly flameable hydrogen, posing a significant fire hazard. One problem was that the builders relized the dirigible would be hanging by a single cable teather wich would add immense stress to the frame so they would need to adjust the building and strengthen the the frame to support the additional load. This costed over sixty thousand dollars to adjust, a substantial investment for an unproven concept. After that was taken care of the builders still had other problems.Another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area many pedestrians walk, below where the dirigibles would be docked. The winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around erratically and lead weights could not be used because of the dangers of them falling and causing injury or damage on the streets. These combined safety and practical issues ultimately proved too difficult to resolve.
794	15627	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was when al Smith realized that he was close to Not winning the world's tallest building. It talks about it in paragraph @NUM1. Then he annonced that the building would reach 1,250 feet, a decision that was directly tied to the mooring mast proposal. That's an obstacle because without the building itself being completed to a sufficient height, he cant make the dirigible docking station a reality, and he always wanted compitition so his building had to be the winning one and he had to build the dirigible mast to add to its prestige and functionality, creating a complex challenge of simultaneous construction and design."
795	15628	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced Problems to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some Problems were that most dirigibles from other countries are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, creating a major safety concern for the city. Also The winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents and could cause the dirigible to wrap around the building or tear loose from its mooring. Another @CAPS1 the builders faced was a existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas, this law would make it illegal for the dirigible to even come near the building, presenting an insurmountable legal barrier. They also had to spend @MONEY1 to upgrade the framework so it does not put to much strain on the top of the building from the force of a tethered airship. These financial, natural, and legal hurdles collectively prevented the plan from succeeding.
796	15629	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the architect and builders have to overcome very big obstacles while trying to make this plan of docking dirigibles work. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of this building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" With this enormous dirigible in the air and the wind blowing around would hurt the buildings structure."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" With all of the wind the dirigible would be tugging back and forth on the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This demonstrates that to build a docking station the architects would have to transform the whole construction of the building, a monumental engineering challenge."
797	15630	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building came with a lot of obstacles to make it work. One obstacle is their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet long which is equal to four blocks in New York City, making them impossible to land in the dense urban environment. Another obstacle is they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. This would add stress to the buildings frame and to dirigibles moored up there, as the immense forces involved required a fundamentally reinforced structure. These physical and spatial challenges proved significant.
798	15631	6	3	"The workers on the Empire State Building ran into many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large city. Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future problem for the workers. The process was a troubling challenge overall. It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One precaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed."" The project altogether was unrealistic so therefore it was a great challenge for workers attempting to dock dirigibles at such a height and in such conditions."
799	15632	6	3	The builders had a tough obstacle because they were trying to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building and were trying to compete with other skyscrapers. The dirigibles were a key part in building the Empire State Building's reputation, but they were faced with obstacles that were hard like wind, safety, height and other factors. These were the main challenges. For the dirigibles to dock successfully, there were issues as the dirigibles were not heavy enough to remain stable, and they couldn't anchor as well because they were made with light materials. These are the reasons why the docking plan ultimately faced significant difficulties.
800	15633	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature and safety. Safety played a large role in the building of the Empire State Building. Two main safety concerns were getting passengers safely on and off dirigibles and the substances they were filled with. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This created a substantial fire hazard high above the city. The next obstacle the builders faced was nature. The wind speeds would shift due to violent air currents, causing the dirigibles to swivel around. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making a safe and stable connection nearly impossible. Due to these fundamental nature and safety issues, the builders of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."
801	15634	6	3	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with several significant obstacles. One major obstacle they faced was the strong and unpredictable wind current. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mast, making a secure docking procedure nearly impossible. Another considerable obstacle was the immense added stress that would be put on the foundation of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate..."" as stated in paragraph @NUM2, highlighting the structural concerns. A third obstacle the builders faced in this matter was the inherent dangers of fire, as the flammable lifting gas posed a significant risk, as well as the chances of endangering those down below, which is discussed in paragraph @NUM3. One last legal obstacle faced by the builders was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM4), which presented a regulatory hurdle. Those are just some of the many major obstacles faced by builders, attempting to dock dirigibles on the top of the then tallest building in the world, ultimately contributing to the concept's impracticality."
802	15635	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced considerable challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, this ambitious task was not so easy to accomplish. The builders of the Empire State Building could not just drop a mooring mast on its flat roof because they had to consider how the immense size of the dirigibles were affected. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it would be mechanically difficult to transmit the combined stress of the dirigible's load and the powerful wind pressure. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The substantial cost to improve the building's framework was also a major financial obstacle. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1), representing a significant investment for a venture of uncertain practicality."
803	15636	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there began with the fundamental need to make the building itself taller. The builders added a distinctive mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers a means to get on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked by a specific method which meant that an electric winch, located on the mast, hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it securely to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, creating a beacon. The roof construction had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place, requiring precise sequencing of the work. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted to, resulting in the mast's completion, though the practical use for dirigibles remained limited.
804	15637	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such obstacles included the existence of a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which created an immediate legal barrier. Also they could not anchor down the back of the blimp, and due to the shifting winds that high up it would not be safe for passengers to get on and off, posing a serious risk to human safety. The building also had to be structurally rebuilt to be able to come close to staying stable with the heavy dirigible attached, requiring extensive reinforcement. And last was the critical differences in gases used to keep the blimps afloat. Most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, making the entire operation very unsafe. These are some of the primary obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there, illustrating the multitude of challenges involved.
805	15638	6	3	They faced significant challenges such as how to get the dirigibles to anchor securely on the building. There was really no safe way to do it, as the proposed methods were all fraught with risk. They also stated that the gas that keeps it floating is highly flammable, creating a major hazard. So it was like one big safety concern from every angle. In reality they ended up realizing its too dangerous for them to proceed with the plan. If they took the chance and something went wrong, many innocent people on the ground below could die, a consequence that was deemed unacceptable.
806	15639	6	3	The dirigibles had numerous obstacles to face, primarily consisting of possibilities of fire, popping, and legal trouble. They feared the dirigible would catch on fire because it was filled with hydrogen, a gas that is rather highly flammable. They did not want to relate to the tragic accident that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. Also, the fear of pops raised more concerns, for a strong wind might blow the craft off course into another building with a sharp top that could possibly puncture the balloon. They particularly feared this happening in downtown New York, where it is highly populated. Another reason, probably the biggest, was that the Empire State Building was subject to a law for aircraft flying low over urban areas, so that meant there was no chance they could do what they were planning on doing, effectively ending the ambitious proposal.
807	15640	6	3	The biggest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the unpredictable weather. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Due to these powerful wind currents, dirigibles would not be able to stay still long enough to allow the passengers to get off of the dirigible safely. They once tried this in a notable instance; in December 1930, the Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. If the winds blew strong enough, it could slam the dirigible into a sharp object, causing a catastrophe. After this attempt, there was an additional complication; the building was affected by an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Consequently, any dirigibles could never tie up to the building because of this new law, but the primary and most persistent obstacle remained the winds, which also put tremendous stress on the structure itself.
808	15641	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced more problems than expected in their plan to dock dirigibles. One of the first significant problems they faced was that the building's original frame could not support the enormous weight and force of a moored dirigible. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, requiring over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. The builders were thus forced to modify the structural framework, which cost a large amount of money and proved to be a primary financial and engineering obstacle. Another major obstacle the builders faced was the wind caused by nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which could potentially make the back of the blimps swivel around the mooring mast, making it incredibly difficult or dangerous for passengers to get on or off of the dirigibles. Finally, the builders faced the problem of laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. If ships could not even legally approach the building, the builders realized the combined obstacles were too great for the mooring mast to work as intended, leading them to conclude the venture would never be successful.
809	15642	6	3	Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future, as they were much more advanced and controllable than simple balloons. In New York City, there was a notable lack of suitable landing areas for these large dirigibles. The idea of using the Empire State Building seemed like a good solution; landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other passenger services. However, the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building without consideration, especially since a typical dirigible could be a thousand feet long. Such a massive craft would add significant stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a specialized shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower to serve as the mast. The mast had four wings at its corners for stability, and the building, now 102 floors tall, was adapted so that floors 101 and 102 were for the observation area, which was intended to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrated framing the entire building after two months of intense effort. Now, however, people lost their hope, as it became clear the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose. It was ultimately deemed never safe nor practical, and the builders faced so many obstacles that the dream was abandoned.
810	15643	6	3	Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a dock for dirigibles had many significant obstacles. There were dangers like the flammable gas contained within the dirigibles, the inherent risk of operating such a craft near a densely populated area, the fact that the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and the peril of having a massive airship dangling high above pedestrians. These obstacles collectively proved very difficult to solve. In the dirigibles, the gas bags are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a tremendous risk if the dirigibles ever caught on fire. It is also exceptionally dangerous to operate above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed structurally, it would fall on innocent bystanders below. It also is dangerous because the winds shift a lot at that altitude, and the craft could be blown into other objects or buildings around it, potentially getting its envelope popped. Thus, it is clear why it was so difficult to turn the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles. The fundamental conclusion is that turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a loading dock for dirigibles is very difficult to do because the entire operation was ultimately not safe.
811	15644	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign dirigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City, where a single spark could have led to a catastrophic disaster. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin, as the craft would be lurching and swaying unpredictably. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by on the streets below. Although a mooring mast was, in theory, a useful idea, it was ultimately neither safe nor practical to implement.
812	15645	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof without considering the immense structural implications. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its integrity. As stated, modifications had to be made to the building's framework to strengthen and accommodate the new situation, a complex and costly engineering challenge. Another great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating an unstable and hazardous environment. This would leave the dirigibles swiveling in any air above pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe for anyone involved. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during the project which unfortunately led to the known fact that the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its purpose as an airship terminal.
813	15646	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that architects cannot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They would also have to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to bear the additional loads, and all this was going to be worth sixty thousand dollars of modifications, a substantial financial investment. These engineers had to try to dope out a practical workable arrangement, and also the government people in Washington were figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast. This idea of doing this was neither practical nor safe because all these things would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, posing a constant risk. This could have never happened either because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier. These were some of the significant obstacles the builders faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building.
814	15647	6	3	"The builders and architects faced several different obstacles and dilemmas that interfered with the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast. One of them being the funds necessary in order to produce such a large structure and the specialized modifications it required. They found themselves constructing and reconstructing the frame of the structure time and time again, all in a feeble attempt to reach the desired perfection for this unprecedented feature. Another obstacle occurred when their entire concept shattered by the fact that not every dirigible intended to land on the mast was fueled by helium, the safer lifting gas. The text reads, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". This displays the severity of the idea, where risks like that just could not be taken in a major metropolitan area, so they ultimately abandoned the idea of the mooring mast for regular use."
815	15648	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" it shows that it was not easy making the dirigibles a safe docking station at the Empire State Building. A struggle that was faced during this time was that dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen, which is highly flammable and volatile. This meant that if it was exposed to fire it would instantly catch on fire over the world's most populated city, creating an unimaginable tragedy. Another problem that was faced was the amount of wind at the top of the Empire State Building. With all this wind it was hard for pilots of dirigibles to steer and maintain a stable position. The wind would toss them around violently, and pilots couldn't take their hands off the gears for a moment, requiring constant and strenuous effort. These were just two of the many struggles pilots and architects had to face when attempting the complex process of docking a dirigible at a mast, challenges that ultimately proved insurmountable."
816	15649	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when planning for dirigibles to dock there. They consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and observing the mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station to better understand the challenges. The builders also had to meet with the president of a newly formed airship transport company to discuss the feasibility and logistics of their ambitious plan. Despite these efforts, the practical difficulties of safely mooring an airship to the skyscraper proved to be a significant hurdle that was never fully overcome, ultimately leading to the concept's abandonment.
817	15650	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when having dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle for example was landing, as New York City lacked a suitable open area for a dirigible to approach. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof without considering the immense structural and safety implications. Also, safety was a major problem, highlighted when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been worse, especially in a densely populated area like New York. Even nature was an obstacle, as winds were constantly shifting on top of the building. So lead weights were considered for stabilizing the dirigible, which wasn't safe because they would be dangling over pedestrians on the streets below. Furthermore, there was a law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas, creating a final legal barrier that made the entire venture impractical.
818	15651	6	3	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" written by the historical research group, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There are three main reasons why the iconic skyscraper was not used for the purpose it was constructed for. The point of the building was so that dirigibles could stop and refuel, with dirigibles being an old word for blimps. The obstacles the structure had to overcome were modifications, nature, and the law. They had to pay a significant sum in modifications on the building for the framework to handle the stress of a moored airship. The second was nature, as the winds would make the back of the dirigibles move around dangerously; they wanted to put weights on the back of them but that was not safe for the city below. Last but not least was the law, as the dirigibles couldn't fly as low as the building's mast because it was too low and they were prohibited from flying low over urban areas, rendering the mast unusable."
819	15652	6	3	"Based on the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by the historical society, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, including the overall structure of the building being affected by stress from the dirigible, safety issues, and the impact of nature. To start off, the dirigible's weight plus the wind pressure around the building, caused too much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. The historical society writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This was a major obstacle along with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented them from becoming a big landing spot for dirigibles, and the mast served only as a landmark."
820	15653	6	3	"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural, as ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the structure to last under such conditions. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe for any airship attempting to moor. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway, as ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it altogether. Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. The developer's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose,"" remaining an architectural curiosity instead of a functional port."
821	15654	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by the building's designers, the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in its attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary obstacle was the immense structural stress a moored airship would impose. To accommodate this stress, sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications and structural strengthening would have to be done to the building's frame. Another critical obstacle was the fuel used by foreign dirigibles; those from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than the safer helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If an incident like the German Hindenburg being destroyed by fire was to happen in New York, the consequences would be much worse due to the dense urban population. Also, the wind at that altitude would be a persistent obstacle as well. It would cause the back of the ship to swivel all around the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. One of the most overlooked obstacles was that of the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which meant it was technically illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building. Clearly, these were many substantial obstacles placed in the path of attempts to allow a dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately dooming the ambitious plan."
822	15655	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was overcoming the extra structural stress that a docked dirigible would add. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" author Marcia Amidon Lùsted states ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" requiring significant reinforcement. Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent and unpredictable weather at the top of the building. Lùsted says ""Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and break the mooring mast."" This was a serious problem because it would make it unsafe for passengers to exit the dirigibles and walk down a gangplank connected to the Empire State Building. The powerful wind also made it difficult for a dirigible to navigate to the mooring mast without being blown into other buildings in the area. One of the greatest obstacles was making the mooring mast safe from fire hazards. Lùsted states ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to catch fire over a heavily populated area like New York, the casualties would be numerous. These were some of the many significant obstacles builders faced when attempting to construct a functional and safe mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
823	15656	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of trouble and confusion in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. This had never been done before, and they didn't know what to expect, except for the concept of a mooring mast. At first, Al Smith and his builders thought this was an amazing idea, representing the technology of the future, but things weren't that easy. They faced complications with the initial research on dirigibles, finding the process complex and demanding. It was a complicated process because it was occurring high up in the air, and there was a lot of practicing involved to understand the dynamics. Next were the necessary alterations made to the building itself; the structure wasn't strong enough to hold the dirigible, so they made sixty thousand dollars worth of changes to reinforce it. They finally realized this was an unsafe idea, and it wouldn't be good with the highly flammable hydrogen gas used by foreign airships, so they were back to square one. Then the government presented them with a law that said no airships were permitted to fly too low at or over urban areas, which would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building. In the end, the ambitious plan was abandoned, and the top floors were turned into a soda fountain instead.
824	15657	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of the problems they encountered were related to designing the mast itself. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet; the structure was simply not strong enough to handle the additional loads. To address this, they had to strengthen the entire building with a new and more robust steel frame, a complex and costly undertaking. Then the builders also faced significant safety issues beyond mere structural integrity. At a thousand feet, the air currents were extremely violent and unpredictable, posing a severe hazard to any large, lightweight aircraft attempting to maneuver near the building. These powerful winds made a stable and secure docking procedure practically impossible to achieve. By the end of the construction period, it was quickly noticed that, despite all efforts and modifications, dirigibles simply could not land safely on the Empire State Building, rendering the mooring mast an architectural novelty rather than a functional port.
825	15658	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for several main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" requiring substantial reinforcement. This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached is that many used highly flammable hydrogen gas for lift. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York, the resulting disaster would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the high winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating an unstable and hazardous situation for anyone attempting to disembark. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"" during its approach. The dirigibles could not fly so low over the city without posing a significant risk to people and property below. Ultimately, dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because the collective dangers were far too great to overcome."
826	15659	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced constructing a correct mooring mast for the zeppelins involved both the safety of the people in the city and the structural integrity of the building itself. They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps, as high winds posed a constant threat. The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen its base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable under the immense strain. They then ruled out using heavy weights to anchor the blimps in place because of the potential danger to the people on the street below from falling debris. Also, the hydrogen gas within the blimp was highly flammable and put the people around the building at significant risk of fire. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough to the mast without their envelopes being punctured by the structure. Ultimately, the builders were faced with a series of impossible obstacles to overcome, rendering the mooring mast impractical for regular use.
827	15660	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face, primarily from environmental factors. For example, mother nature itself was one of their huge challenges they would mostly face during the docking process. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents, creating a highly unstable environment. As soon as a dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep their airship from crashing into the building from the gusty winds at the top of the building, a nearly impossible task. Therefore, if a dirigible crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crash it would involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it produces as it crashes on the ground, endangering the entire city block. The inherent dangers of the volatile gases and the unpredictable weather conditions proved to be insurmountable obstacles for the ambitious plan.
828	15661	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included the fundamental lack of a suitable landing area for the massive airships. They intended to ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuel, or service, and to let passengers off and on,"" but the design presented significant difficulties. Also, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of a winch,"" which was the method they planned to use and faced challenges with to dock there. This winching process required precise coordination and a stable platform, both of which were difficult to achieve at such a great height. The mast structure itself, while innovative, did not provide the safe, controlled environment necessary for such a complex operation. Consequently, the envisioned system for passenger transfer and servicing never became a practical reality, as the initial concept was flawed from the start."
829	15662	6	3	In the construction of the Empire State Building there were many problems that were faced during the build, particularly concerning its intended purpose. The way that this all began was when the architect Al Smith wanted to make a building like no other, a building that was taller than the new Chrysler building and one that was futuristic. The first problem that they ran into was, what was a building of this size going to be used for, as they needed a unique function to justify its scale. There were many different ideas but the one that came to Al Smith was transportation, specifically air travel. This building could be used for a new kind of transportation where people could board a Dirigible, also known as a blimp, at the very top of the building. The next problem was if this would be safe to do because they couldn't have a big disaster in the middle of New York. The idea went to Washington to be reviewed and ended up not being considered safe enough for public use. Despite the safety concerns, Al Smith didn't care, as his primary goal was achieved: his building was the tallest in the world, and the mooring mast remained as a testament to an ambitious, though unrealized, vision.
830	15663	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in realizing the dirigible docking concept was nature itself, which presented a formidable and unyielding adversary. The weather conditions at the unprecedented height of the mooring mast were far more severe and unpredictable than initially anticipated. Powerful gusts and turbulent air currents made it exceptionally dangerous for the large, slow-moving airships to approach the structure. Even a slight miscalculation could send a dirigible crashing into the building or cause it to be torn from its moorings. The fundamental forces of wind and weather proved to be an obstacle that engineering could not reliably overcome, ultimately dooming the practical use of the mast for its intended purpose.
831	15664	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously was not helpful to the project. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed, and the mooring mast ultimately went unused for its intended purpose.
832	15665	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to made to the building's framework. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. If that had happened at the Empire State Building it would have had extremely drastic results. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. These were just three of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, and they ultimately proved insurmountable.
833	15666	6	3	During construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders faced many challenges. If they had just put a spire on top of the building, the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building to handle the immense strain. Other obstacles in their way included low-flying aircraft laws, which prohibited such operations over the city. Furthermore, difficult weather conditions at that height, with powerful and unpredictable winds, made stable mooring nearly impossible. Finally, there was the paramount issue of safety; if the dirigible, often filled with flammable hydrogen, crashed over New York, the consequences would be catastrophic. For all these reasons the mooring mast was doomed from the start and never served its intended function.
834	15667	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, she talked about the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles were safety, mother nature and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacles was because of safety. Lusted states that the mast never fulfilled its purpose and the greatest reason was safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch on fire and be a danger for all. Secondly, nature itself would have an effect on the dirigibles. Lusted states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The violent air currents couldn't allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents; it isn't safe. Lastly, laws were an obstacle the builders had to face. Lusted's knowledge is that the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law was a huge obstacle for the builders because you can't build something with it being against the law. Because of safety, mother nature and laws, that is what stopped the builders from successfully using the mooring mast for dirigibles."
835	15668	6	3	The primary obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the high winds at such a great altitude, which made stable mooring a severe challenge. The builders had difficulty designing the structure to withstand these forces. They kept adding to the building and making it taller to accommodate the dirigibles, which needed a prominent and visible landmark for navigation. The problem was that the design and construction process was fraught with difficulties, as things kept breaking or something would go wrong during testing and planning. They kept working on the building to try and get it right but continued to fail to create a feasible system for the airships. They had to make their plans more realistic and overcome the fundamental engineering and environmental challenges, and that was their major problem which ultimately prevented the concept from becoming a practical reality.
836	15669	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on letting things dock there was the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said that air craft's weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas, which presented a significant legal barrier. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Also it was unsafe due to the hydrogen in the dirigibles, posing a grave fire risk. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature was a factor because of the high winds and unpredictable weather conditions at such a great height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the obstacles that the engineers never thought of, the Empire State building never became a dirigible landing site as originally envisioned."
837	15670	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the safety of New York people, a primary concern for city officials. They could have used hydrogen and the dirigible could have caught on fire and landed somewhere bad, potentially causing a catastrophe in the densely populated streets below. As said in the text, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, creating an unstable environment. Even if they were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast, making a secure docking practically impossible. Another was there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the entire operation. The idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared as these formidable challenges proved insurmountable."
838	15671	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles while trying to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. As stated in the text, nature was the biggest obstacle the builders faced, with weather conditions being highly unpredictable. The ""violent air currents"" would cause dirigibles to move around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered, creating a hazardous situation. Another obstacle faced was that the architects couldn't just add a mooring mast to the top of the building; over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building's framework to reinforce the structure and bear the additional load. Lastly, as stated in the text, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, even though it was flammable and posed a severe safety risk. When the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went up in flames, the owners of the building realized the inherent dangers of this volatile gas, ultimately dooming the ambitious plan."
839	15672	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles with the proposed dirigible docking station. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat surface; it took a lot of stress and hard work to design and integrate it into the structure. The dirigible was to be held by a single cable tether, a method that presented significant engineering challenges. Furthermore, the dirigible was about a thousand feet long, a massive object to manage in an urban environment. That made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigible's load, calculating the immense forces that would be exerted on the building. These considerable physical and technical difficulties contributed to the project's ultimate failure.
840	15673	6	3	There were a few problems with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. One problem would be the foundation and the immense structural strain. If dirigibles were to land on the building it would cause tension on the buildings foundation, potentially squishing it down under the enormous weight and dynamic forces. The architects would need to have made significant adjustments to the Foundation in order for a dirigible to land safely. Another problem was the way the ship would be docked and its unpredictable movement. When the ship would be docked, it would be a hazard because it would sway back and forth around the mast due to high winds. Either causing damage to the structure or injury to people of New York below, these risks made the concept impractical and far too dangerous to implement.
841	15674	6	3	"There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrollable, forceful, and unexpected. In a specific historical account, it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (L¸sted), clearly demonstrating the winds were an insurmountable issue. Another significant problem was a law against airships that flew too low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This catastrophic event was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen, another grave threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in immediate danger. The mooring mast idea, once seen as visionary, was now considered non-sense and an impractical dream."
842	15675	6	3	Dirigibles, or blimps, were being hailed as the transportation of the future in the 1920s. They had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling, making them seem ideal for long-distance travel. One major obstacle the builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith spotted the opportunity for his Empire State building to solve this problem. He was to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, thus allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. Also, it would let passengers off and on, creating a terminal in the sky. The problem with this plan was that the builders couldn't just set the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. If a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the structure, held by a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the building's frame, posing a serious structural risk.
843	15676	6	3	In the early 1930s, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles, which were seen as the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch to pull it securely to the tower, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used for lift. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. Furthermore, the soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area. The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. Any man in his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun due to these compounded and inherent risks.
844	15677	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They consulted with experts, taking tours of equipment and observing mooring operations in New Jersey to better understand the challenges. The architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building; if they did, it would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the load and the powerful winds would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Consequently, the steel frame would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to bear the burden. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around and around the mast. You could weigh it down but that weight would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical or safe. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. And when they tried delivering newspapers via a small blimp as a stunt, they noticed the entire concept simply wasn't going to work in a real-world setting.
845	15678	6	3	The builders had to face a lot of complex challenges. They had to rebuild the whole top of the structure again so the dirigibles could dock there securely. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building without considering the consequences. A dirigible on top of a building held by a single cable tether would add a lot of stress to the building's frame, creating a constant and dangerous strain. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be upgraded and strengthened significantly to handle this additional load. Also, all of these necessary structural modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the building's framework better, representing a substantial financial investment for an unproven and risky venture.
846	15679	6	3	To have a building built over a thousand feet tall and expect dirigibles or blimps to be able to dock there is dangerous and presents many obstacles. First, the weather is not always nice. If you have a windy day, the blimp is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York. Putting lead blocks in the back as a counterweight would be very dangerous, as you would have heavy lead swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread, a risk highlighted by historical airship disasters. Finally, blimps could not moor at the Empire State building if it is against the law for an airship to hover too low over urban areas, which would legally prohibit the operation. Those are the many reasons why blimps could not moor at the Empire State building, rendering the concept impractical.
847	15680	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A thousand-foot dirigible would add considerable stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The accident of the Hindenburg also raised alarm, as it set fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This showed the builders how much worse the accident could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area, such as New York, leading to catastrophic loss of life. Another factor were the wind currents, which were constantly shifting and powerful. This would cause the back of the dirigible to sway and move about, making a safe and stable mooring nearly impossible. There was also a preexisting law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier. These are some of the reasons and obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the failure of this ambitious plan.
848	15681	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle is described as the structural strain, where a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. This means that they would need to strengthen the whole building significantly; if they didn't, the building would maybe fall over or be damaged. The next obstacle is described as the force of nature itself, being the greatest challenge to the successful use of the mooring mast. This means that the wind is so strong up there, it would take a while to land safely, and also that the wind could cause the dirigible to fly away or become uncontrollable. The final obstacle is described as an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means they could be a target to destroy the building, and another thing is that if it ever fell it would kill a lot of people on the ground. These obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were not overcome, and the project was consequently cancelled.
849	15682	6	3	"There are many obstacles that the builders faced in order to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was safety concerning the gases used. Foreign countries used highly flammable hydrogen to fill their dirigibles with, posing a severe fire risk. According to the passage, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle was the weather. The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents, making mooring maneuvers extremely hazardous. For example, the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles, couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind, which might have resulted in a puncture in the shell of the dirigible. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage, ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" creating an insurmountable legal barrier. Because of the many obstacles that the builders faced, the Empire State building was unable to fulfill its original purpose as an airship terminal, but it is still considered a worldwide landmark today."
850	15683	6	3	In the article 'The Mooring Mast,' the author describes several problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, most blimps or dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, and since downtown New York is so densely populated, if anything were to go wrong, such as a fire, it could severely impact the people of New York, resulting in numerous injuries as well as deaths. Another reason is an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas, this law making it illegal for an airship to even approach the area, thus preventing any docking attempts from the outset. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles related to safety and legality that could have been noticed before building the mast, demonstrating a significant oversight in the initial planning.
851	15684	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the workers faced a few significant problems. One was how to make it the tallest building in the world, because the architect building the Chrysler Building had secretly raised its total height with a spire, making it the largest building in the world. Al Smith, the former governor of New York and the project's promoter, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles at the very top. Another obstacle was attaching the heavy steel mast to the top of the building's frame. It could not be simply dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance and reinforcement had to be done to the existing steel framework to support the additional weight. A third problem they had was the practical challenge of tying up the dirigibles, as violent winds could turn the blimp around, possibly puncturing its fragile gas bag against the mast or the building itself. After the Hindenburg atrocity, which demonstrated the dangers of hydrogen-filled airships, the people in charge would no longer let blimps dock at the building, for fear of endangering the public below. Thus, the mast was never used for its intended purpose, becoming a monument to an ambitious but unrealized vision.
852	15685	6	3	"People involved in the design and construction of the Empire State Building were faced with a few major obstacles in attempting to transform the idea of docking dirigibles into a practical reality. One of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a ""cable tether,"" then immense stress would be put on the building's steel frame. The builders and architects had to find a way to allow this stress to travel safely down the structure to the foundation of the building. They spent over sixty thousand dollars modifying and reinforcing the framework to handle these potential loads. In addressing the obstacle of storage and operation, the architects and builders worked through the issue by putting the winches and control machinery in the base of the shaft of the ""conical roof,"" keeping the heavy equipment out of the way. Despite these engineering solutions, the fundamental challenges of weather and safety ultimately prevented the plan from ever being implemented."
853	15686	6	3	Although the builders' dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, they came across many insurmountable problems. One problem was the existing law against flying too low over densely populated urban areas like New York City. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didn't work, as the violent and unpredictable wind currents throughout the city's canyons severely affected the docking maneuver. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down by a ground crew, an operation which would be impossible while docked to a skyscraper, causing the dirigible to sway around and possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into full consideration how densely populated New York City is, meaning that if anything ever happened to a docked dirigible, like the tragic fire that consumed the Hindenburg, many people on the ground would be affected. This combination of legal, natural, and safety concerns is why the ambitious idea always stayed a dream.
854	15687	6	3	The obstacles the builders took on were difficult, and time consuming. In ways such as these, the only benefits the Empire State Building really possessed was being the tallest building in the world. They also attempted to construct a dirigible docking base for future transportation, but they failed to do so because of certain laws and technical difficulties. Other obstacles, such as adding extra body work to the building's structure to support the mast, proved in the end to not even be necessary. The challenges involved significant cost and effort, yet the fundamental concept was flawed from the start. Those are the obstacles the builders faced, and as well as the consequent waste of both time and resources on a venture that was never realized.
855	15688	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add significant stress to the building's frame."" This is a very important obstacle because if the frame becomes too stressed by the excess weight and force of the dirigible, the structural integrity could be compromised. Another obstacle is wind, as ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is also a major obstacle because the dirigibles were very light, lighter than air, so the violent winds would swing it around, and such instability that high in the air is not a safe thing, especially considering that downtown Manhattan is below where there are thousands of people. A third obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal to fly at the altitude required to be able to tie the blimp up to the building. These combined issues of engineering, safety, and legality ensured the dirigible docking plan was ultimately abandoned."
856	15689	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author writes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (Lusted, paragraph @NUM1) It was reported that the winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. A dirigible on the building would not be able to land properly or be weighted down with lead weights like those in open landing fields. It would not be practical to dangle weight over the heads of hundreds of people walking in the streets below. In addition to nature itself, safety was another great obstacle that the builders were faced with. It is written that, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lusted, paragraph @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located. An accident had already occurred with a German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, which highlighted the potential danger. When all is said and done, nature and safety were two significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
857	15690	6	3	What the builders are faced with while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, one of them was nature. The winds at the top of the building were always shifting cause of violent air currents, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Even if they were able to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building the cable that is holding it will cause pressure to the building. They only way you could have the building not have pressure on it was to modify the building so it can get stronger that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even if they were able to get around all these obstacles there is a law against airships flying to low over the city, which presented a final, legal barrier. So either way it would not have been able to happen successfully.
858	15691	6	3	A dirigible is not like a plane or a hot air balloon, it is filled with flamable gases, and to try to dock something that big on top of the worlds tallest building would be extremely dangerous too the urban town below and extremely dangerous for the workers. The sheer size of the airship and the volatile nature of its lifting gas created a significant risk of a catastrophic accident. Given these inherent dangers, the proposal to dock dirigibles at such a height in a major city was ultimately an impractical and hazardous idea.
859	15692	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" author Marcia Amidon Lusted speaks of the obsticles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the frame of the Building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. Therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. As the excerpt says, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move and sway. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city, adding a legal impediment. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building, making the plan unfeasible."
860	15693	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced many different obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary challenge was to be able to design the mast without having to reconstruct a big part of the building, which would have been costly and complex. Also a big aspect of it was that they had to face was to be able to make it safe. These big dirigibles can be very flammable and having something that major in a very populated city like new york would be very risky and unsafe for the public below. The last problem they faced was nature. Of course you canot change nature so this was a problem was there since the beggining but was probably overlooked or never even thought about, as the high-altitude winds proved uncontrollable. So this really never would of been able to suscesfuly work without any problems, ensuring the concept remained grounded.
861	15694	6	3	The Empire State Building faced a great many problems in its attempt to function as a dirigible terminal. One significant obstacle was that the plan was never thought out clearly from a regulatory standpoint. The builders did not initially consider an existing law that prohibited aircraft from coming too close to any suburban or urban areas. The potential danger of such an oversight was made tragically clear to everyone when the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship burned to the ground. Another great obstacle they faced was the force of nature itself because the winds on top of the skyscraper were always shifting due to violent air currents. This unpredictable weather would cause a docked dirigible to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. One last critical obstacle was the physical structure of the dirigible and its effect on the building, because if the large airship kept on landing on top of the building, the stress and impact would keep on destroying the building's own structural integrity over time. These are some of the primary obstacles that were faced and which ultimately doomed the venture.
862	15695	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigibles, also called blimps, were very big; this was a fundamental problem because they were too large to maneuver safely in an urban environment and could not get close to the building reliably. Furthermore, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (par. @NUM1). This is exceptionally dangerous because a single accident could occur and the blimp could explode right over the city, potentially hurting thousands of people. The winds above the building were another major issue, as they were sometimes violent and created unstable conditions, making it hard for dirigibles to reach the mast. As the text notes, ""Even if the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (par. @NUM2). Ultimately, it was far too difficult to allow dirigibles to dock safely at the Empire State Building, and the purpose for which the top of the building was specifically created could not be used because the entire concept proved to be too dangerous."
863	15696	6	3	"In the making of the Empire State Building, the builders faced some significant problems regarding its planned use as a dirigible port. All of these problems were negative for what they actually wanted to accomplish with the mooring mast. Some of these problems were directly related to what the airship balloon was made of and the gas it used. Most balloons at the time used hydrogen instead of the safer helium, which was harder to obtain. In the excerpt, they emphasize that ""hydrogen is highly flammable,"" a characteristic which could cause a catastrophic fire and many deaths. Also, another major challenge was the strong and unpredictable winds at that altitude, which could carry the balloon off course and make it very hard to handle during a docking attempt. A last critical situation would be that there is a law about low-flying vehicles, and the dirigible would have to fly low to approach the building, violating this regulation. In conclusion, the problems they had were fundamental and could not be easily fixed, so the ambitious plan for a skyscraper air terminal was ultimately ruined."
864	15697	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary obstacle was the legal restriction. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM1), which presented a clear regulatory hurdle. Although at first the builders looked past this, there were many other non-legal obstacles that they faced which were equally daunting. There was also a grave safety issue with docking dirigibles, as ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM2), creating an immense fire risk over the city. One last formidable obstacle the builders faced was the wind conditions at such a great height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM3), making a stable and secure docking procedure nearly impossible to achieve. With all of these combined obstacles of law, safety, and nature, it would not only be improbable, but close to impossible to ever successfully dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building."
865	15698	6	3	When Al Smith wanted to make a dock on the Empire State Building, he was not really thinking straight about the practical realities. That was a horrible idea from a safety perspective, as passengers would risk their lives going on and off the dirigibles at that tremendous height. He probably was not thinking about critical safety considerations and was just going for the impressive looks and publicity of the concept. The obstacles he would encounter involved the risk of death for anyone attempting to use it, the unpredictable weather, and the significant cost. The weather was a huge factor because if it were to be windy, a common condition at that altitude, it could throw the dirigibles off course and cause them to crash into the building or the city below. The cost to make this landing pad would be crazy, too, because they would have to buy all the necessary equipment and fundamentally alter the building's structure to create a functional landing station. Ultimately, Al Smith was not a smart guy for pursuing the idea of letting dirigibles land on the skyscraper, as the plan was fraught with insurmountable dangers.
866	15699	6	3	"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been to dangerous of a risk, a fact tragically underscored by the 1937 hydrogen blimp fire which had a disastrous outcome; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp, leading to a potential crash. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock, ultimately dooming the ambitious concept to failure."
867	15700	6	3	"While constructing the mast to docs dirigibles to the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flamable hydrogen, that could be detrimental to the condensed New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building, if exploded, posing an unacceptable public hazard. Also, wind on top of the building was out of there control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it would be unpractical and highly dangerous to the public below. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear. The obstacles that stood before the Empire State Building's mast were to great to optimistically believe the project could be finished. It was postponed and became obsolete with the invention of airplanes, sealing its fate as a historical curiosity."
868	15701	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is the winds on top on the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents, making a stable approach nearly impossible. Also the dirigibles use Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. So if it blows up, there gonna be a lot of bad things going on in New york, potentially causing catastrophic damage and loss of life in the densely populated urban center. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over Urban areas, which presented a legal barrier that could not be easily circumvented. The building would have to be modified and strengthened before the dirigibles could go there, adding significant cost and complexity to an already problematic venture.
869	15702	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 on the excerpt from The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L√ºsted there were many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obsticle the builders faced was safety. Paragraph @NUM1 states, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how horrible an accident could be if it takes place in a highly populated area. The greatest obsticle the builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"" paragraph @NUM2 states. They could have weighted it down with lead weights, but using these where they would be hanging above pedestrians was not safe, creating another public safety risk. The last obsticle the builder faced was the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for any ship to dock at the @ORGANIZATION1 on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there were many obsticles builders faced to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these combined factors ensured the mooring mast would never be used as intended."
870	15703	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle.In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage, not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well, with devastating consequences. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down, making a secure mooring practically unachievable. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways? The sheer impracticality and danger of the scheme ultimately led to its abandonment.
871	15704	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. It was strictly hard for architects to simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, as a dirigible held by a single cable tether would add immense stress to the building's frame. This structural challenge was one of many dilemmas and complications the builders faced. To manage the load and wind pressure, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework, reinforcing it from the mast down to its foundation. Ultimately, these fundamental engineering and financial hurdles were key reasons the ambitious plan proved unworkable."
872	15705	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first initial issue that they faced was the immense structural stress the blimp would put on the building. As the article states, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation."" This significant stress prompted the need for further, costly improvements on the building itself; which obviously costs time and money. Another problem they faced was the inherent impracticality and danger of the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles required hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As a result of the Hindenburg disaster, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown Manhattan."" Another great issue that presented itself was the inconsistent and violent air currents at that altitude, which made safe docking for the blimps extremely difficult. This problem could theoretically be combated with lead weights, but they ""were neither practical nor safe."" And lastly, there was already ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law effectively prevented the blimps from being able to fly as low as the building, let alone land there. In conclusion, the builders of the mooring mast at the Empire State Building faced a series of interconnected obstacles in its construction which collectively questioned its safety and prevented it from ever being a practical reality."
873	15706	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Starting with the fundamental challenge of putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph 2). They had to extensively modify the steel frame of the building to handle the stress, reinforcing it all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph 2). This structural reinforcement would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the United States ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph 3). So the flammable dirigibles were considered too dangerous to fly over such a densely populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong and unpredictable. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph 4), making passenger operations impossible. In the end the problems the builders faced were too many, and ultimately unfixable, so the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was abandoned."
874	15707	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the profound safety risk, as it was very dangerous to have a hydrogen-filled dirigible—hydrogen being highly flammable—dock over one of the most densely populated areas at the time. They could not allow an accident like the one that had happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey, to occur in New York, noting that, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes, specifically the weather: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant the dirigible would not be able to stay steady enough for safe docking or unloading of passengers and cargo. Other proposed ideas to solve this problem, like using weights for stability, were deemed ""neither practical or safe."" The final obstacle was a legal one, as ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". As shown, it was simply impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building because of the combined challenges of natural causes, public danger, and the law itself."
875	15708	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the structure of the building itself; after the mast was designed they needed a building that could withstand the stress of a docked airship. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" They were able to overcome that initial design obstacle. Another, more serious obstacle was safety concerning the airships' fuel. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" What obstacles did that bring? Well, hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area like Manhattan. This safety obstacle brought upon another obstacle of practicality. Dirigibles customarily landed in open fields, not atop skyscrapers. ""The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds on top of the building made it unsafe; the only solution would be tethering the dirigible and weighing down the back with lead weights, but using these at the building, ""dangling high over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". Thus, the architects faced many interconnected obstacles that ultimately doomed the project."
876	15709	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One of the greatest reasons was safety, as most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a significant fire hazard. Another obstacle that arose was nature; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead weights to their tails to prevent movement, but there was nowhere for those weights to be attached at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved insurmountable for the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to moor a dirigible.
877	15710	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems, which was noticed after the building of the Mooring Mast, was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. The immense force exerted by a docked airship posed a serious structural risk. Another issue was safety, and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable and could lead to a catastrophic accident. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably, making a safe and stable mooring virtually impossible. These fundamental problems ensured the concept was never successfully realized.
878	15711	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, if a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether was moored at the top of the building, it would add immense stress to the frame. The workers had to transmit the stress all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. They had to modify and strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not fully realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems with the framework, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could effectively do to prevent this instability, the inherent flammability of the airships' gas, or circumvent existing laws, leading to the failure of the venture."
879	15712	6	3	There were several main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for dirigibles. For one, it was profoundly unsafe. Most dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was too great, especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent and unpredictable air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe by causing it to swing violently. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This regulation made it impossible for dirigibles to legally dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all significant contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.
880	15713	6	3	"Marcia Amidon Lusted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they would have to face was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's frame. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make costly modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lusted points out, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting, making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around dangerously. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigibles down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigibles down with lead weights, but using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."
881	15714	6	3	"When builders attempted building a structure to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building in New York, they did not realize how many complex problems they would encounter. Upon designing the mast on top of the building, designers realized that if a dirigible was docked on to the building, it would add significant stress to the frame, and therefore, would have to modify the Empire State building's entire structure. To do this, sixty thousand dollars was needed for the structural reinforcements, as well as many more hours of labor. Another obstacle encountered was the fact that nature got in the way, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (line @NUM1). It would be extremely difficult to dock it to the building, because the dirigible would be constantly swaying due to the powerful wind, and passengers could not safely get on the blimp. Furthermore, blimps usually were moored in open fields, with the aid of lead weights to help weigh them down. If heavy lead weights were introduced in New York City, where it was very populated, they could potentially fall while dangling high in the air, endangering pedestrians below. In conclusion, builders faced many insurmountable obstacles while trying to achieve docking capability for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
882	15715	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced; one of them were redesigning some parts of the Empire State Building. The builders' job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigible or blimps. This plan came with great difficulty, as they couldn't simply drop a mooring mass on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. They came to figure out that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This considerable stress would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation. The builders had to modify and strengthened the steel frame in order to accommodate the situation of the stress on the building frame. Also, creating the rocket shaped mast, the builders had to work on many different parts, including the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. This work had to be done presisely in order for everything to work correctly. These were the significant obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State building."
883	15716	6	3	The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the massive aircraft down they would have to use heavy lead weights. If these weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous for the people on the streets below. Also, when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the Hindenburg blowing up they felt understandably uneasy about the entire project. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the strong wind would whip it around violently, making it even more unsafe for both the craft and the building. The idea was good in theory but not probable to be safe in practice, leading to its eventual abandonment.
884	15717	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, there was obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof without considering the consequences. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building frame. So the architects have to motify it and stregthen the building's internal structure to bear this load. This involved spending over sixty thousand dollars on the new motification. The building will turn from @NUM1 floors to 102 with the addition of the mast. From there dirigible passenger will board from a special gangplank. In conclusion when building the Empire State Building there was significant obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there safely.
885	15718	6	3	"There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause many trageties because it would be directly above people's homes. For the same reason, there was a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Beyond the safety risks for people below, there was the wind causing a problem so that the blimp could not even dock correctly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around."" One of the attempts proved that it would be tricky to land. The Los Angeles attempted to reach the building, but retired the thought because of the strong wind. The captain feared he could fly into one of the spires of a tall building and the dirigible could be punctured. ""[He] could not even take his hands off the control lever,"" showing the immense difficulty of the maneuver."
886	15719	6	3	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith, the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building, came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city and a central hub for air travel. After the mast was proposed, designers discovered significant problems with the mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, it would transmit stress all the way down the frame to the foundation due to the immense load and wind pressure. Furthermore, the high wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around violently in the wind, which is very unsafe being so close to a building structure. These fundamental engineering and safety challenges ultimately proved insurmountable for the ambitious project.
887	15720	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, a lot of problems were faced in allowing the dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles that were faced would put people's safety at significant risk. One of the primary problems was that the tail of the dirigibles would swivel uncontrollably because of how high up it was; the wind at that altitude would be particularly violent and unpredictable. Another critical problem that was stated was that foreign dirigibles were made with hydrogen instead of helium, so they were highly flammable and posed a grave fire hazard. The combination of volatile weather conditions and the use of dangerous, combustible materials made the entire docking concept a perilous endeavor from the start.
888	15721	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, they didn't initially realize that the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" and in order to fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for modifications to the building's framework to handle the additional structural load. Another problem they encountered, besides the fact that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" was that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to be able to get close enough to dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would easily damage the dirigible's fragile shell. An alternate problem faced by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable."" They realized how catastrophically unsafe it would be to have an accident like that ""above a densely populated area."" And so, builders were forced to stop their work on the mooring mast, rendering the idea impractical."
889	15722	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems attempting to dock dirigibles. Most of these problems were serious safety concerns. One major issue was the use of hydrogen in many airships, which is a highly flammable and explosive gas. A fire accident would be catastrophic, since downtown New York is a densely populated area with many people below. Another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be weighted down as it usually is, because then there would be massive weights dangling dangerously over the city streets. With the high winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, dirigibles would have swayed and moved around erratically. That creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings, leading to a potential disaster. Also, if the blimp ever successfully moored, it would create tremendous stress on the building's structural frame. Besides the technical issues, there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got properly considered or addressed. The first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers. That makes it illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning as intended. The second problem was that the proper mooring equipment, like winches and a passenger gangplank, were never installed. That meant no landing attempt could ever succeed. The builders faced many obstacles building the mast, but they're biggest obstacle was a fundamental lack of preparation and a failure to address these obvious problems from the outset.
890	15723	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two primary obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds present at such a great height. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and unpredictable gusts. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mast, making a stable and secure connection nearly impossible. The second obstacle was a legal one, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it explicitly illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, creating a regulatory barrier that could not be overcome. These two factors, one environmental and one legal, combined to ensure the mooring mast would never be used for its intended purpose.
891	15724	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant and multifaceted. In a contemporary report from the time, it reads that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This substantial cost indicated that the designing of the Mast was going to take some considerable time and effort. Another obstacle almost called the end of the mooring mast project entirely. In a later analysis, Architects observed that, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its proposed purpose, for reasons that became apparent before it was even constructed."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Given this was such a huge safety concern, the owners thought of the densely populated area of New York and how many people could get hurt if a disaster were to occur, ultimately dooming the venture."
892	15725	6	3	The obstacles that builders faced while building the Empire State Building was, first the buildings structure was not strong enough, the winds were too strong, and the law. The buildings structure could not hold a massive multi-hundred foot dirigible, requiring expensive reinforcements to the steel frame. The powerful and unpredictable winds at that altitude would make the dirigible move violently, which could also ruin the frame of the building and pose a grave danger to the airship itself. Also the law said that the airships could not fly too low over a city, creating a regulatory hurdle that was nearly impossible to overcome. That was some of the primary obstacles that the workers faced while building the Empire State Building, making the dream of a skyscraper air-dock ultimately unworkable.
893	15726	6	3	Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast implausible. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city, which were far stronger than anticipated. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway uncontrollably, risking a catastrophic collision. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flammable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazard above New York City, threatening both the building and the public below. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle in the form of aviation regulations. It was illegal to fly dirigibles too low over urban areas, rendering the entire concept impractical from a legal standpoint. These are the compelling reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out as originally envisioned.
894	15727	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their ambitious plan. By allowing the dirigibles to dock there, they had to build special platforms on the side of the building, which means that they would be putting their lives in danger working at such extreme heights. They also had to deal with the complex electrical problems within and without the building, which were critical for safe operations. The workers on the outsides of the building would have to deal with the strong wind currents that could easily destabilize both the construction efforts and any future docking maneuvers. They also have to make sure that the electrical system was working perfectly to prevent any sparks. If there were to be a spark of any sort of fire, the hydrogen and helium were extremely flammable, and if a wire were too short, it could set the whole dirigible aflame and it would blow up, leading to a disastrous outcome for the city below.
895	15728	6	3	The Empire State Building faced considerable difficulties in its plan to have the dirigibles dock there. The immense wind pressure generated by the large dirigibles threatened to mess up the building's frame work, posing a serious structural risk. To accommodate the situation and reinforce the structure, they paid over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building's framework against these unforeseen forces. This costly modification highlights the significant engineering challenges involved in the ill-fated mooring mast project.
896	15729	6	3	"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles were safety factors and nature itself. Safety was a big obstacle in this plan for a mooring mast because the dirigibles used hydrogen to float these big ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad it would be if the dirigibles were to catch on fire over a highly populated city like New York. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, May 6, 1937, the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control wind and on top of the building the air currents were constantly changing, making it hard to dock. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast couldn't be done successfully, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unfeasible."
897	15730	6	3	A mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which would pull the airship's nose into the mast. The body of the dirigibles swung in the breeze, making the process unstable. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical solution to this complex problem. They worked really hard on the designs and calculations. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some method of mooring airships to the mast, studying the procedures and safety protocols. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service, completing the structural addition.
898	15731	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to be docked there. Based on the excerpt, one of these obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing area. The dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City, making them incredibly difficult to maneuver in an urban environment. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell. Also, for the dirigible mast to be added, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework, representing a significant structural and financial challenge.
899	15732	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to make sure that the mast wasn't too heavy to put on top of the building and when they realized it was they made thousands of dollars worth of modifications to the building so that it could support the mast. They also had to make sure it would be safe for transporting people through this dirigible, considering all potential risks. It depended on the wind and climate, which were unpredictable. They also had to make the building taller than the Chrysler building as part of a fierce competition. They wanted to transform New York's transportation by creating a downtown terminal for airships. In the end, they realized that docking on the building was not possible if they wanted to keep everything safe for the public, leading to the abandonment of the plan."
900	15733	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" the excerpt went through several obstacles such as safety and competition. If the men were not trying to compete, the buildings would probably have been okay without such a risky feature. The intense rivalry to build the world's tallest structure pushed the project forward without full consideration of the practical challenges. If you take your time and really try to reach your goal you can, but the rushed competition led to an impractical design that was ultimately never used for its intended purpose."
901	15734	6	3	"In the article ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was primarily due to safety concerns for the people below. The owner of the building realized how much worse an accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, especially after considering disasters involving airships. Another example of why the builders faced challenges was the impracticality of securing the massive aircraft; while an open landing field could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, dangling a dirigible high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. The proposed docking maneuver at the Empire State Building was not very safe, and this fundamental risk is why the builders ultimately faced such significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
902	15735	6	3	In the 1930s, people did not have technology like we have today, and they were venturing into relatively unknown engineering territory. When the architects were building the Empire State Building they had many problems to solve for the proposed dirigible dock. First, they couldn't just drop a mast on there because, as noted in the story, the roof was not flat, which presented a fundamental structural challenge. Next, it was said that a thousand-foot drop would add immense stress to the building's frame, requiring significant reinforcement. Last, they had to change the frame design and they also had to change the roof structure to even attempt the feat. All in all, the men in the 1930s had a lot of complex work to do while building the Empire State Building, overcoming these hurdles with the limited technology of their time.
903	15736	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons such as safety, nature, and the laws. The greatest reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was tragically destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, highlighting this danger. This accident could have been much worse if it had happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obstacle to get around because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around uncontrollably, which was not good because it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Finally, there were laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the general area. In conclusion, because of these three major reasons working in combination, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
904	15737	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included noticing that the dirigibles would be unsafely dangling high above pedestrians on the street. There were many risks when landing the huge dirigibles, and also a specific law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even approach the area, creating an immediate legal barrier. Famous and important dirigibles had lots of trouble with their landing attempts; for example, in December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough because of the building's forceful winds. The dirigible could move uncontrollably in such conditions and potentially crash into the sharp spires on other buildings around it. In the hope of becoming the transportation of the future, dirigibles ultimately had given way to more reliable and safer airplanes.
905	15738	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there are many, with the main issue being a significant safety concern. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", stated the article, creating an unpredictable and hazardous environment for a large, slow-moving airship. The article further pointed out that ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."" This clearly shows that dirigibles were both impractical and a genuine danger to both the people inside the aircraft and the people on the street below, making the entire concept unfeasible from the outset."
906	15739	6	3	The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York, leading to catastrophic consequences. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it nearly impossible for a large airship to remain stable. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers, presenting an insurmountable risk to both the airship and the city below.
907	15740	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, There were many problems to face to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building. These obstacles composed of the dirigibles themselves, natures winds, and laws that prevent dirigibles being allowed to dock. Some dirigibles from outside the state used hydrogen, a flammable gas, and could cause mass destruction to New York City due to being about the same length as four blocks, in New York City, which meant a potential fire would engulf a vast urban area."" Wind caused the dirigibles to swivel around even after being tied down, creating a hazardous and unpredictable situation for both the aircraft and the building. Since there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."", doing so could cause the captain of the dirigible to be arrested, effectively rendering the mooring mast plan impractical from a legal standpoint."
908	15741	6	3	"The obstacles the builders faced in building the Empire State Building were nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The size was a problem along with how high they were in the sky. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" These significant structural and safety concerns were the obstacles that ultimately made the ambitious docking plan unworkable."
909	15742	6	3	"In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced, in attempting dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced, was that they lacked a suitable landing area. Because of this, they came up with the idea of having the passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform, a perilous proposition at such a great height. Another obstacle they faced, was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" In the end, the idea of the mooring mast, was a failure. The builders didnt think about potential problems that could occur. For example, nature itself, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and even fires, due to the gas (hydrogen) used in some dirigibles, which collectively doomed the project from the start."
910	15743	6	3	If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued, a danger the engineers could not ignore. If they were to use the Empire State Building, They would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process, making it an economically questionable venture. Even then if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers attempting to board or disembark. All in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea when considering the immense structural, financial, and safety challenges involved.
911	15744	6	3	Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building, but there were many obstacles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. Initially, the building wasn't strong enough; if they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire State Building, it would have pulled the building until it fell over. The architects had to upgrade the steel frame so it was safe and could withstand the immense strain. Now that the frame was safe, they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast, the other end would blow in the wind, making unloading cargo and people very hard and dangerous. Also, many dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe for the people on the ground or those in the building. In the end, after considering all these significant risks, it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building.
912	15745	6	3	While the Empire State Building was being built, the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, the former governor in charge of this project, had a goal to build the tallest building. Right off the bat, the first problem occurred when the Chrysler Building revealed its secret 185-foot spire inside, making that building now, in 1930, 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building. The first sign of hope shone upon Al Smith when he saw an opportunity for the Empire State Building with the emerging technology of airships. Dirigibles needed a landing area, and the mooring mast seemed to do the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, was intended to allow dirigibles to anchor for a while to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop but soon became problematic. Safety was a major factor, as most dirigibles from outside of the United States were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accidents; for example, on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like Manhattan, then there would be a catastrophic problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
913	15746	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles included safety issues, nature, and the law. Safety issues were a primary problem because, as noted in historical accounts, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This explains why they couldn't proceed, as if one of the dirigibles would explode in downtown New York, it would cause severe damage and losses of life because it's such a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. Nature played its role because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. This would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around, which was neither practical nor safe for passengers attempting to disembark. The last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying too low over urban areas. This regulation would have made it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. Collectively, these obstacles had made the builders face insurmountable problems in their attempt to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building, leading to the concept's eventual dismissal.
914	15747	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast itself. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building; it originally had a flat roof and required significant structural redesign. If a dirigible was moored, it would add additional stress to the building's frame, and wind pressure would be a major factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles because it wasn't safe; nature presented a problem as the dirigible would swivel in the back. It could possibly be weighed down by lead in the back, but that weight couldn't be hung above pedestrians on the street for obvious safety reasons. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against airships flying too low over cities. Although this had happened, two dirigibles had attempted to moor there; the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one, as a publicity stunt, had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed, so they had to use a wire to receive them. In result, after these failed attempts and the clear dangers involved, the idea was shelved permanently.
915	15748	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were mainly related to safety. Safety was critically important because of how many people there are in New York City. Another problem was that dirigibles from outside the United States were often filled with hydrogen instead of the safer helium. At such a high height, the wind is very strong and the blimps would only be held by the front while the back would swing uncontrollably in the gusts. A blimp could easily be blown into a close building's sharp spires and pop because of the powerful and unpredictable winds. There are a lot of things that could go wrong at any time, from a catastrophic fire to a structural collision, so I think the right decision was to stop the idea of the mooring mast and avoid the potential for disaster.
916	15749	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. This docking mechanism was intended to secure the massive airships, yet the process itself presented significant challenges. The winch had to operate with precision to manage the immense size and weight of the dirigibles, requiring a complex and carefully engineered system. Despite these efforts, the procedure was fraught with difficulty, highlighting the practical hurdles of integrating airship travel with the skyscraper's design. Ultimately, this method proved to be one of the considerable obstacles in realizing the ambitious vision for the building's mast.
917	15750	6	3	Well the dirigibles were airships flying to low over the city and over urban areas. Also the U.S Navy approached the mooring mast to tie up but the winds were to forceful. Also a Goodyear Blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt where it tied up and deliver a bundle of newspapers. This event demonstrated the severe practical difficulties of the operation, as the airship struggled against the unpredictable gusts at such a high altitude. The powerful winds made it nearly impossible to maintain a stable connection to the mast for any meaningful amount of time. These attempts underscored the inherent dangers and logistical problems of using the mast for its intended purpose. Consequently, the idea of regular dirigible docking was ultimately proven to be unfeasible and unsafe.
918	15751	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to make it safe for dirigibles to dock there. Three main issues they faced were adding stress to the building, safety, and urban laws. The Empire state building was already huge & fragile so adding a lot of way to it, would not have helped, ""a seven hundred foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects could not want this, they had to make changes. Before they made the changes, they also realized that it was extremely windy up there, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" For safety, it would not be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to make the building shorter. After all the work they put in, it still wasn't good enough because there was a law that was ""against airships flying to low over urban areas"". After all the time and hard work they put in, there was, in the end, no way to have this idea be successful, as the combination of structural, environmental, and legal barriers proved insurmountable."
919	15752	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had obstacles in their way. There were Dirigibles that were one thousand feet long and they had an obstacle which was that they did not have much space in New York to land. Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked and talked with experts and got equipment ""and studied mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station"", which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything. The Navy offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast. Also the architect met with president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the Pacific ocean. So the builders had many obstacles and made various attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, collaborating with leading authorities to overcome the significant challenges."
920	15753	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building people faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is they would have to have different make new Routes that was yet to get made and existing transatlantic Routes. This requirement for new aerial pathways presented a major logistical and regulatory hurdle, as establishing such routes over a densely populated city like New York was complex. The existing transatlantic routes were not designed to terminate at a skyscraper in midtown Manhattan, creating a fundamental mismatch in operational planning. Coordinating with aviation authorities to create these new approaches would have been a lengthy and uncertain process. Thus, the challenge of developing entirely new flight paths proved to be a significant, and likely final, obstacle to the dirigible docking concept.
921	15754	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was trying to moor a dirigible at the top without stressing the building too much. It says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means they planned to deal with this problem by spreading this stress all the way to the foundation of the building, a significant engineering challenge. Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent and unpredictable. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, all of these obstacles that the builders faced led to the final result of being unsuccessful."
922	15755	6	3	The Empire State Building faced a lot of problems before it came out as an iconic structure. They were scared that other people would destroy this building, reflecting the competitive nature of the era's skyscraper construction. So they reduced the plans for dirigibles to dock there. They wanted their city to become a famous city and get more money from the prestige and tourism such a feat would bring. And another problem was that some people didn't care about the dirigible plan and chose to postpone it to a later date, which ultimately never came. These combined issues ensured the ambitious docking idea was never realized.
923	15756	6	3	"The idea of docking a one thousand feet long dirigible to a mast eleven-hundred feet above the ground never seemed possible. From the factual evidence provided, the theory is proven a failure. ""Dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught fire trying to dock at the Empire State building, the accident would quickly turn into a catastrophe for the dense urban population below. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" The high-speed and shifting winds atop the Empire State building would cause mooring dirigibles to brandish around the mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State building faced was the law forbidding air vessels from flying too low over urban areas. A problem that would condemn the theory from the start, rendering the entire concept impractical and unlawful."
924	15757	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, they were mainly ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". A fire in one of these airships would be devastating being over an enormous city like New York, risking countless lives. The wind currents would also make it impossible to dock there. ""The ship would swivel around the mooring mast"", and could even potentially puncture the frame on the mast structure itself. The whole idea was dangerous and risky. In fact, it would have been illegal for flying ""too low over urban areas"". Not only was it dangerous, but against the law too. Overall, these were the obstacles that workers faced, and the obstacles that won out in the long run, preventing the plan from ever succeeding."
925	15758	6	3	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in the process of letting dirigibles moor at the mooring mast. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the author gives us examples as to what was difficult. One obstacle in the docking of dirigibles to the mast was safety for the people inside the building and the airship. The article says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" It then goes on to say ""Most dirigibles from out of the U.S used Hydrogen, Hydrogen is highly flammable,"" creating a severe fire hazard. Another reason was nature. The author states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to unsecure departure of passengers, making boarding and exiting perilous. The article also says ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel"" which shows unsafe air conditions. These are two obstacles that made landing at the mooring mast very difficult and soon made it impossible to implement safely."
926	15759	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their plan to use the structure as a docking station for dirigibles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York primarily because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating an uncontrollable and hazardous situation. Also, many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed a significant fire risk. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg disaster but in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed; a catastrophe over such a densely populated area would be devastating. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building, effectively rendering the mooring mast impractical from a regulatory standpoint. These combined challenges of nature, safety, and legality ultimately prevented the ambitious plan from becoming a functional reality."
927	15760	6	3	Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems such as too much wind movement, too much weight, and too many safety risks when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The wind movement would move the dirigibles around violently when trying to dock, so they would have persistent troubles with stabilization and control. They would also have weight problems because they didn't have a stable enough frame around the building to support the immense stress of a thousand-foot airship pulling on a single tether. They would have to pay a lot of money to fix this problem, making the venture financially challenging. The last problem was a profound safety problem. After the German dirigible Hindenburg blew up they realized that it was way too dangerous to have blimps, many of which used flammable hydrogen, landing over crowded cities. It was also a flying law that airships were not able to go that low over a city, creating a legal barrier. This combination of insurmountable physical and regulatory hurdles is why the builders had faced so many problems with their dirigible docking scheme.
928	15761	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State building faced the obstacles of the use of hydrogen in dirigibles in which is highly flammable, nature itself, and an existing law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It stated in the excerpt that most dirigibles outside the united state used hydrogen, which is very flammable. Realizing that this kind of happening above an outrageously populated area such as New York City would be extremely dangerous was a major concern. To explicate, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". However, the greatest obstacle was nature itself. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting, which was certainly not safe for a large, buoyant aircraft. For example, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The builders soon realized that this fundamental issue of unpredictable wind currents could unfortunately, not be resolved with the technology of the time. Lastly, a more apparent obstacle that the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to even approach the area, adding a legal impossibility to the physical ones. The obstacles of the use of hydrogen, nature itself, and an existing law, made it impossible for Al Smith's plan to become realistic and led to the abandonment of the concept."
929	15762	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the ""violent air-currents"" present at such a great height. Due to these powerful and shifting currents, it became very hard to be able to allow a dirigible to dock at the top of the empire state building, without the aircraft blowing away or becoming uncontrollable. Another significant obstacle was public safety. The dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen, instead of the safer but less available helium. Hydrogen is a very flammable substance and if an accident were to happen, a flaming balloon flying over a highly populated area of New York could become very dangerous, risking lives on the ground as well as in the airship. Although the idea of making docking stations for dirigibles is a good idea in theory, promising a new form of transit, there are too many obstacles and hazards, both natural and man-made, preventing it from ever happening as a practical and safe endeavor."
930	15763	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that arose was the construction of the mast atop the building and its effect on the structure. According to the excerpt, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" From this you immediately know that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be properly modified and reinforced in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast, a considerable engineering challenge. Another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative and fitting for the landmark. ""... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside..."" However, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds at that altitude would have been too unstable for a dirigible to dock securely. The problem is that the winds could potentially ""swing"" the rear of the dirigible around the mast, which is extremely dangerous and risky for both the aircraft and the building below, a problem that proved ultimately unsolvable."
931	15764	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles with attempting to allow a dirigible to dock there. These problems consisted of safety and practical issues. One significant safety issue was that most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen was far more flammable than helium, a fact tragically highlighted by the destruction of the German airship Hindenburg by fire. As one source notes, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States uses hydrogen rather that helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders also had to contend with practical issues, such as the existing law that made it illegal to fly an airship too low over a city. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building."" Ultimately, these combined obstacles stopped the hopes of landing an airship on the building, rendering the plan unfeasible."
932	15765	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let the dirigibles dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the ""lack of a suitable landing area,"" as mentioned in the text. A second obstacle was the immense amount of stress a dirigible would put onto the building's structure. As the author states, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" The author also states that for the invention to work, the Empire State Building's steel frame would require more strength and would have to be significantly modified to accommodate the new idea. The greatest obstacle faced was due to the nature of where the building was located; because of its height, the winds were so strong and shifted constantly, creating a hazardous environment for docking. The last obstacle the builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By the late nineteen thirties, the idea of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building had completely disappeared, and the future of air transportation was instead given to airplanes."
933	15766	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it hard to build the mooring mast. One problem they faced was that most of the dirigibles made outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. As the text indicates, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it would be if that happened in New York City which is highly populated."" Another significant obstacle was Mother Nature. Winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and unpredictable. In the text, the author states, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The last obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. The author states that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" These various challenges ultimately prevented the mooring mast from being used as originally intended."
934	15767	6	3	"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and the weight as well as length of the dirigible were challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State Building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself; winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This meant that the dirigible, which was made to be ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mast and have no weight support to keep it stable. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible from getting close enough, like in one instance when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough. Another major issue was safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible, which was hundreds of feet long and held by a single cable, would add tremendous stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame significantly. These obstacles plus many more showed that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""
935	15768	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a couple of significant challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it. One main problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and they didn't want to have another accident like the one that destroyed the Hindenburg. They realized that if an accident like that had happened in a densely populated area such as New York, it would have been a thousand times worse, leading to catastrophic consequences. This fundamental safety concern, among other practical difficulties, ultimately prevented the ambitious plan from becoming a reality.
936	15769	6	3	"How safe is it to have a large dirigible hovering above thousands of civilians? The builders had many problems to face when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. For one thing, the mast was not yet even said to be ready in this excerpt ""to fix a mast at such a height made it desireable to postponed to a later date,"" indicating significant construction delays. The landing gear was also not yet ready or sure to work, raising serious doubts about the feasibility of a secure connection. The idea of using dirigibles over such a crowded area was not even said to be relevantly smart, as the potential consequences of a mishap were far too great. Ultimately, the inherent dangers and technical unpreparedness meant the ambitious plan was never a practical reality."
937	15770	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized it would be much more dangerous in a crowded area like Manhattan. A second obstacle was that the dirigible would be swivelling around the mast because of violent air currents, making a stable mooring nearly impossible. The dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which is definitely not safe. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Thankfully, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quickly disappeared, and the builders had no more obstacles to face, allowing the building to secure its legacy without the associated risks.
938	15771	6	3	"The idea of Hindenburg-sized airships landing on top of the Empire State Building sounds preposterous in today's day and age. However, in the 1920s this was a dream of many. Unfortunately, this dream never came to be due to multiple obstacles faced by the builders. The first obstacle faced by the builders concerned what was in the airship itself, hydrogen. This would be a problem because the vast majority of blimps visiting ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". So if an accident ""had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" it could be disastrous. Another major problem were the winds. They were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and so the ships could swing into other buildings, creating an uncontrollable hazard. These two points aside, there was a ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" anyways. So regardless of the wind or the hydrogen it wasn't legal. These three obstacles combined made the dream of airships landing in New York stay a dream and not a reality, a vision grounded by practical and legal constraints."
939	15772	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock. The huge balloon caused tension and stress due to its ginormous size. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". The stress of the dirigible, can cause crucial damage on the buildings frame, threatening its structural integrity. Also, it was not only the size; the contents of some of the planes caused a crisis as well. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The worries of the balloon catching on fire was too much to risk, especially over a populated city. Along with all, is the power of nature itself. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds on top of the building were very violent compared to the ones on the ground, causing a scare for any potential landing. It looked all good until everything was looked at carefully, obstacles came from all different ways, ultimately proving the plan to be unworkable."
940	15773	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building flat roof... A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might collapse. Another point that proves that the builders Empire State faced was that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self"". The winds on top of the building made it dangerous for a large, lightweight aircraft to remain stationary. Clearly there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced, which prevented the ambitious dirigible docking plan from ever becoming a routine operation."
941	15774	6	3	"In the excerpt from *The Mooring Mast* by @ORGANIZATION2, builders faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt it states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the wind and the dirigible's immense weight would have to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation of the building, about eleven hundred feet below, requiring significant structural reinforcement. In paragraph @NUM2 of the excerpt it states, ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire, in an area as heavily populated as New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse. Furthermore, the winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent and unpredictable air currents. This left the designers to deal with the complex problem of a massive dirigible swinging wildly around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced so many insurmountable obstacles that they eventually abandoned the project entirely."
942	15775	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith had the idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the U.S. He wanted to out-do the Chrysler Building, and Smith wanted it to be 1,250 feet. His specific idea was to add a mooring mast for airships. However, significant issues got in the way, such as how highly flammable blimps were, how densely populated the city was, and the violent shifting winds. Blimps are highly flammable because they often contain hydrogen, and even helium can pose risks. The danger was starkly illustrated on May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. New York City has millions of residents and tourists a day; in such a densely populated area, the consequences if something went horribly wrong were unthinkable. Yet the greatest issue was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would Swivel around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Faced with these overwhelming challenges, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the building concluded that efforts to make the Empire State Building a dirigible terminal was neither practical nor safe."
943	15776	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, builders faced many significant obstacles. One of these primary obstacles was the need to modify the whole frame of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This quote from the excerpt clearly shows that the builders would have to engineer a way around this immense structural challenge to complete their job, which would entirely make this situation a major obstacle. Another formidable obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows another obstacle because builders could not find a practical or safe way to get the passengers off the swaying airship, and proposed solutions like putting lead in the back would only endanger the pedestrians on the streets far below. The final and perhaps most critical obstacle the builders faced was the overarching safety of everyone involved. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows a very big obstacle, the terrifying reality of which was demonstrated by the tragic fate of the German dirigible Hindenburg. Those were the key obstacles that were faced by the workers during the time of attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
944	15777	6	3	Many obstacles occurred for the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the plan for allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was the function of the mooring mast itself. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting, and if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the airship's tail would swivel dangerously around the fixed point, making passenger disembarkation nearly impossible. Another obstacle the builders experienced during this process was the already existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to the fact that the Empire State Building was located in the heart of New York, a major urban area, the dirigible docking idea would have most likely never worked within these legal restrictions. Consequently, the dirigible was unable to fulfill its intended destiny, and the numerous obstacles the builders faced were the main reasons for the failure of this ambitious concept.
945	15778	6	3	There are some obstacles the builders faced during this time while constructing the Empire State Building with its intended mooring mast. One of the primary issues was the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast; the technical challenges were so great that it was decided to postpone the mast's installation to a later date. As it turned out, the Empire State Building wasn't destined to ever fulfill its purpose as an airship terminal. For several reasons, which should have been apparent before it was constructed, the plan was fundamentally flawed. And another significant obstacle was the complete lack of a suitable and safe landing area for the massive and volatile airships in the dense urban environment. These combined obstacles ensured the concept remained an unworkable dream.
946	15779	6	3	"There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The volatile nature of this gas meant that if an accident would occur above a densely populated area, such as New York, it would be catastrophic, risking immense loss of life and property. Another obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This unpredictable motion made a stable and secure docking procedure nearly impossible to achieve. Another obstacle the builders had was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier that could not be easily overcome. These combined challenges ultimately proved too great for the ambitious plan to be viable."
947	15780	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast, creating an unstable and hazardous situation for both the aircraft and the building. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this structural problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction, namely the inherent dangers of hydrogen and the uncontrollable weather, were too great to surmount."
948	15781	6	3	"A building is a complex structure that cannot be easily tampered with, and still be considered safe. That is the major problem the builders had. It isn't easy you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"". They had to strengthen the structure and that took ""sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to ensure the building could withstand the additional forces. Plus the builders had to design a nice plan for the mast, to make it look nice and integrate it with the building's iconic aesthetic. They even had to use glass which is a harder material to work with for certain parts of the mast structure. Although the greatest obstacle the builders had was allowing the dirigible to dock. One it was filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if it ever blew up it would have killed a lot of people in the city. However ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". This was mentioned and is the main reason why the idea failed. The winds were always constantly shifting, which caused the back to swivel and become unsafe. Weights on the back would have made it even more dangerous, because they could fall onto the streets below. Lastly laws prevented flight so close to the ground, adding a regulatory hurdle. But even so many other blimps tried, like ""Columbia"" and ""Los Angeles"", and found it was too hard to fly that close to building and dock as well. The idea had many holes in it from a practical and safety standpoint."
949	15782	6	3	"In the excerpt, they tell some reasons why it would be difficult for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. In paragraph 6, it says, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and tied to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank of the observation deck."" This shows how it could be potentially dangerous for the passengers of the dirigible to get off, as the shifting airship and narrow gangplank high above the city presented a significant risk. Another reason was that dirigibles were losing passengers in the late 1930s due to the airplane. As it is stated, ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" That quote shows had dirigibles were losing popularity due to the airplane, which was faster and more reliable, rendering the entire docking concept economically obsolete before it could ever be perfected."
950	15783	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flamable because they use hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire and once the Empire State Building noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit as the public's fear of such a disaster grew. Another obstacle was one that couldnt be fixed, because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definatly not safe and created an entirely new danger for the city below. The last thing that stopped them was a law that was against any airships the flew too low in urban areas, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. All in all, the builders faced too many obstacles, from safety and nature to law, to successfully build a mast for dirigibles."
951	15784	6	3	Builders had many obstacles to overcome when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area, as the building's roof was not designed for such a purpose. This obstacle did not stop Al Smith, he saw this as an opportunity to add a mooring mast at the top of the building so dirigibles could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibly be dropped on top of the roof of the building without significant structural changes. The stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. With this, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing @MONEY1 just to change the framework. In the end, this mooring mast to dock dirigibles never came through, and architects should have seen the potential problems in the beginning, making the entire venture an impractical and costly failure.
952	15785	6	3	"In the Mooring Mast, Marcia explains how Al Smith attempts to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to allow dirigibles (blimps) to station there for several hours. The architects faced many obstacles in trying to add the mast onto the design of the Empire State Building. One of these obstacles was remodelling the building, so the weight of the blimp wouldn't stress the foundation. ""A Thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (∂ @NUM1) A different obstacle that delayed the progression of blimps being docked at the top of the Empire State Building was because of safety issues. Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium. And because New York was highly populated, there was no doubt that there would be frequent fires. Even the owners of the Empire State Building realized that this danger, on May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg disaster underscored the catastrophic risks involved, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the plan."
953	15786	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building, who wished to place a mooring mast at the top of the building, faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, and should a single spark enter the balloon, the entire dirigible would catch fire. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how harmful an accident could be if it took place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A third reason was that, even should there be some way of holding the dirigible still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that dirigible still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" All these problems contributed to the mooring mast's fate of disuse, rendering the ambitious concept unworkable."
954	15787	6	3	"The first main obstacle that the builders faced was the fact that blimps, even though they have propellers and rudders, are still at the mercy of the wind. And since the wind on top of the building was described as ""Constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM1) it would be impossible to keep the blimps stable while it was moored on the Empire State building. Just docking the blimp onto the building was an impossible feat; the only blimp that even tried to dock onto the Empire State building, the naval dirigible Los Angeles, could not get close enough to the building to get the mooring lines on because they were ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of the other building in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" (∂ @NUM2) causing the dirigible to fall onto the city. The second main obstacle was the public safety aspect of trying to moor a dirigible on the Empire State building. There were too many things that could go wrong. The blimp could explode like the Hindenburg, or could run into one of the spires on the surrounding buildings and plummet to the ground potentially killing or severely injuring hundreds of people. That is why trying to dock a dirigible on the Empire State building was an impractical idea from the very start."
955	15788	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Those obstacles were safety reasons against it, laws that made it illegal, and nature (weather). In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the building, all aspects of the project had to be safe - but they weren't. ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM1). A German dirigible had caught fire in New Jersey and the Empire State building owners realized how bad a fire could be in downtown New York, which is densely populated. Secondly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area"" (∂ @NUM2), which would make even trying to approach the building illegal. Lastly, nature was not going to change and suddenly cooperate for one project and it was unpredictable when or if the weather would permit docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around... dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" (∂ @NUM3). Sounds safe, or practical? Definitely not. In the end, all of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were too great to overcome and the top of the building never became a mooring mast for dirigibles, serving instead as a monument to a fascinating but unachievable dream."
956	15789	6	3	"The workers faced many significant obstacles while building the Empire State Building. Since Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the title of the tallest building, he kept adding on to the Empire State Building's design. To make his building the tallest in the world, he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State Building 1,250 feet tall, but it required the builders to redesign the entire building's skeleton. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could hold up the mast, which was a substantial structural challenge. The mast was conceived so that dirigibles could land there and people could board and disembark. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders fixed the steel frame of the building within two months, and the construction went on as planned. After a while, people began to see that the mast couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building, which made any such landing maneuver perilous and impractical."
957	15790	6	3	"When builders were constructing the Empire State Building they came across many obstacles. One problem was the lack of a suitable landing area in Manhattan. Al Smith came up with the idea to put a mooring mast on the top of the building to allow dirigibles to land there, but there were many problems with this plan. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the buildings frame."" Consequently, the architects had to strengthen the building's foundation and framework extensively. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent to try and modify the building's steel framework. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds at that altitude were constantly shifting, and the back of the ship would swivel around dangerously, which was not safe for passengers or the structure. Another reason the plan failed is that airships flew too low over urban areas, creating a hazard. Having a mooring mast for dirigibles to land was ultimately dangerous, went against some aviation laws, and proved to be a lot of work for an unfeasible concept."
958	15791	6	3	In this excerpt, there were several obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building. The obstacles they faced involved the dirigible and the success of the mooring mast. The dirigibles were enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen or helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a simple balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, similar to a gondola. Another major obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it nearly impossible for a large airship to dock safely. The prospect of a massive dirigible weighing down and dangling above the pedestrians on the streets below was not safe. All in all, these were the significant obstacles they had to face and ultimately overcome, or in the case of the mast, accept as a failure.
959	15792	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary problem they faced was that a dirigible moored to the top of the building would add significant stress to the building's frame, so the stress of the dirigible's load would have to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation, requiring substantial structural reinforcement. Another serious problem they faced was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen for lift, so it would be catastrophic if one was destroyed by fire above the densely populated streets of downtown New York. Also, there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to even approach the docking area, rendering the entire concept fraught with legal and safety challenges from the outset.
960	15793	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced were largely avoidable. The first obstacle they faced was the limited landing space they had available on the skyscraper. If they had thought a little bit longer, they likely could have figured out a way to overcome that initial problem with a more innovative design. Now, as the text illustrates, a couple of obstacles discussed pertained to the ultimate fate of the mast. Everybody, including Al Smith, should have thought more thoroughly about public safety; it should have been the first priority in such an ambitious and untested venture. The builders should have seen a problem like this coming, given that they were implementing a poor plan to build something that no one had ever done before on such a scale and in such a location.
961	15794	6	3	"In the beginning, all the plans made for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. Dirigibles would tie up to the mast on top of the building and dock there while the passengers got off; easier said then done. Soon enough they began to realize all the flaws in this plan, there were several main issues. After seeing how easily the ""Hindenburg was destroyed by fire"" they realized it was too dangerous having dirigibles filled with flammable hydrogen fly over such a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It was far too windy for the light dirigibles to stay in place. Along with the wind problem, if somehow a dirigible was able to be tied down ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Furthermore, unlike dirigible landing fields it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of Manhattan just to hold the back of the dirigibles down. Unlike previously thought, dirigibles were not the way of the future, airplanes became the newer more efficient way in the late 1930's. A good idea, but as they said: ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""
962	15795	6	3	The developers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another issue they had was that many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they encountered was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around uncontrollably. They got the idea to use lead weights on the back but it would not be safe over all those people below. Consequently, the ambitious plan for a dirigible terminal was ultimately abandoned.
963	15796	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building had a grand idea of including a mooring mast where dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, could dock themselves. Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to be moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive. Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature. The building was 1,250 feet tall, so the winds up at the top were constantly changing and dangerous, making it difficult for the dirigible to remain stationary when moored. Also, something the builders didn't foresee was the laws against blimps flying too low over urban areas. These two challenges ended up making the use of the mooring mast impossible for its intended purpose.
964	15797	6	3	One obstacle that the builders faced was that having dirigibles hanging over a heavily populated area was extremely dangerous, because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, demonstrating the catastrophic risk. Another obstacle was that it was illegal to have blimps flying too low over heavily populated areas, which presented a legal barrier that could not be overcome. So Al Smith, the former governor who led the project, had to let go of that plan and accept that the mooring mast would remain largely symbolic. The vision of a bustling airship terminal atop the world's tallest building was thus never realized.
965	15798	6	3	Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building caused way too many obstacles for the builders. Dirigibles were up to one thousand feet long, this would make it realistically impossible for it to dock because the size of it would add immense stress to the building's frame. The builders would have to reconstruct and make the frame stronger to bear the load, a costly and complex endeavor. Most non-rigid dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and not helium which is highly flammable; if it caught fire, pedestrians below could be seriously hurt. Furthermore, they discovered an existing law about airships flying too low which would make it illegal for a dirigible to even fly near the Empire State building. Faced with these insurmountable technical, safety, and legal challenges, the plan was ultimately deemed unworkable.
966	15799	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. What these builders were facing was a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, the height of the Empire State Building is 1,250 ft. Adding the single cable tether would add too much stress to the building's frame, so the workers would need to modify and strengthen the building's frame to handle the immense strain. Another problem they didn't realize at first was the wind, from violent air currents that created unpredictable and dangerous conditions for a large, stationary airship. With all these problems that were not easily fixed, eventually the idea of a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building disappeared, ending the ambitious plan."
967	15800	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area for the massive airships. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way; nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents, creating a highly unstable environment. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe."" In order for it to be safe, they came to another obstacle. The entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over sixty thousand dollars worth of investment, a significant financial burden. Lastly, there already stood a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, presenting a legal barrier. With all obstacles faced, it was never opened to the public."
968	15801	6	3	"The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to let dirigibles to dock were the wind conditions and how close dirigibles were to the building. The wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there safely. The winds near the top of the building were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which posed a significant risk to the large, buoyant aircraft. The other problem the builders faced was how close dirigibles came to the building during attempted approaches. In one case, as a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but it, ""could not get close enough to tie up...,"" demonstrating the practical difficulty of the maneuver. Even though the building was not what it was supposed to be for airships, it is still one of the greatest of all time, renowned for its architectural achievement."
969	15802	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One of the first obstacle the builders faced was realizing that the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame from the tethering cable. The builder's realized that the wind pressure could make the dirigible swivel which would not be suitable for the foundation of the building and could compromise its structural integrity. Strengthening the building's structure to withstand these forces would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a considerable expense. The workers also realized that the dirigibles are flammable and if something were to go wrong, such as a fire, it would cause a devastation to such a populated area like Manhattan. These obstacles put an end to the dream of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.
970	15803	6	3	Throughout the excerpt on trying to build the Empire State Building, the builders faced a lot of hard attempts trying to build the dock for the dirigibles. One major problem is that the dirigible was not able to land on the building's flat roof, as it required a specialized mast for mooring. This was stated in the excerpt. Another problem is that they had to design elevators and stairs for the passengers to travel to the top of the building to be able to get on the dirigible, which added complexity to the interior plans. Along with designing stairs they had to be able to build 102 floors just for the area where the blimp would land, making it an extraordinarily tall structure. This can be supported in the reading. After trying to build the big building, the builders ran into major safety concerns towards the end of the making, including the risks of high winds and fire. The builders did not think they would run into any problems or think of the safety initially, but these issues ultimately prevented the dirigible dock from becoming a reality.
971	15804	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was structural; the ""stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to spend over @MONEY1 to create a reinforced frame that would be able to stand that amount of pressure. Another obstacle they were facing was the inherent danger of the airships themselves, as most dirigibles had hydrogen in them, which is very flammable. They were afraid that if the balloon caught on fire, it would fall down to the densely populated city below, and there was nothing that they could do to change this volatile situation. A third obstacle they were facing was the unpredictable weather, as ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant that the dirigible would be constantly moving around while passengers tried to get on and off, which would not be safe for anyone involved. These are some of the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in their ambitious plan."
972	15805	6	3	"The builders' expectations were set too high and they faced many obstacles they had not foreseen. Safety was a big issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" With a highly populated city like New York, it would have been easy for a fire to begin, leading to a catastrophic disaster. Another obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock was nature itself. The wind at times could be too powerful and unpredictable. As said the reading, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These threatening winds would have made it impossible for the dirigibles to land steadily and serve as safe transportation for passengers. The last obstacle was that it was illegal. There had @CAPS1 been a law against it, which presented an insurmountable legal barrier. The reading states, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With this law in place, there was not even a glimpse of hope that this ambitious plan could ever be successful."
973	15806	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles when trying to make it possible to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They could not simply add an all steel mooring mast on top of the building because it would add too much stress to the frame and foundation of the building. If they were going to add a mooring mast, they needed to undertake extensive modifications and strengthen the building's frame to handle the additional load. The other major problem the builders faced was public safety. They had to consider the fact that many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which was highly flammable and posed a great risk. The Building was located in a densely populated area in downtown New York City, amplifying the potential danger. The last obstacle the builders faced was the force of nature. The winds on top of the building were very strong and the air currents frequently shifted in unpredictable ways. This would have made the dirigibles swivel around the mast, creating an unstable and hazardous situation for any attempted docking operation.
974	15807	6	3	The Empire State building was facing off with the Chrysler building that was being constructed at the same time. The Chrysler building had a trick up its sleeve by constructing a 185-foot spire inside the building and then hoisting it into place, which shocked the public upon its reveal. Bringing it to a height of @DATE1 feet, it stood 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State building, making it soon to be the tallest building in the world. This clever maneuver by its rival meant the Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its original purpose of being the tallest structure from the outset of the competition.
975	15808	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When a dirigible was docked, it was held by a single cable tether, which added considerable stress to the building's frame. The entire steel frame of the building from top to bottom would have to be modified and strengthened to address this new situation; more than @MONEY1 was spent for these critical modifications on the building's framework. When the owners of the Empire State building found out about the Hindenburg being destroyed by fire, they realized how much worse it could have been if it happened right over downtown New York. If there was a docking accident and the dirigible was filled with hydrogen, then that would be disastrous for the workers inside the building and anyone else around the immediate area, highlighting the grave risks involved.
976	15809	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. With downtown New York being a densely populated area, that wouldn't be such a great idea, as any leak could lead to a catastrophic fire. Another obstacle they had to face was the weather itself. The Empire State Building was very high so it got really windy. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, making it nearly impossible for a pilot to maintain a stable position for docking. They also weren't thinking about the government when they were building the mooring mast. There was a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. It would be illegal if a ship even tried using the mooring mast, rendering the entire concept impractical from a regulatory standpoint. These combined challenges ensured the ambitious docking plan was ultimately abandoned.
977	15810	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of perfectly placing a thousand-foot dirigible on top of the building, which would not have worked out because of the wind. There was no weight in the back that would have kept the dirigible in place, which now meant that the dirigible would have been swinging back and forth. This gave the risk of the dirigible poking a sharp point on the corner of the Empire State Building and exploding, the dirigible above New York City and putting thousands of lives in danger. The builders also faced the challenge of getting the machinery that was needed to construct the mooring mast, a complex and untested apparatus. Another obstacle the builders had to face was getting approval due to safety hazards because of what had happened to the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, a disaster that highlighted the extreme dangers of airship operations. These significant hurdles proved insurmountable for the project's success.
978	15811	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast to dock dirigibles. It was unsafe for a dirigible to be so close to the ground, especially in a congested metropolis like New York where a crash would be devastating. The air currents from high above made the machine harder to operate near buildings, creating unpredictable and hazardous flying conditions. Another factor that contributed to the danger was that dirigibles are highly flammable due to the hydrogen which made most of them stay afloat then, posing a constant risk of ignition. Many blimps attempted to dock at the Empire State building, none of which were successful, demonstrating the impracticality of the concept in real-world conditions. Ultimately, the vision of a downtown dirigible terminal was never realized.
979	15812	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were structural problems, breaking laws, and keeping the dirigible safe in the air. The structural problems this would have caused was the pressure on the building's foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles, a tremendous force for which the structure was not initially designed. The builders were also breaking the law because there is a law saying how low an airship can fly over an urban area; the dirigibles would be way too low, violating federal aviation regulations. The final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air. This is due to the high winds; the airship would be swinging around and could break off, leading to a loss of control. Another issue would be if it blew up, the pieces would fall onto downtown New York City, causing widespread damage and loss of life. Consequently, the planned use of the mooring mast was deemed unfeasible.
980	15813	6	3	"Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over a thousand feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by a contemporary publication, obstacles included adding stress to the building's frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel, but even this robust material faced unprecedented engineering demands. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at such extreme heights. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous, endangering the entire surrounding area. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation, remaining an architectural curiosity."
981	15814	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" various obstacles were faced in the challenge of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State Building's mooring mast. The first challenge the builders faced was that of nature. ""The greatest obstacle ...was nature itself."" The violent winds that high up would cause the dirigible to swing unpredictably, making it unsafe for both the aircraft and the structure. Another problem arose when the ""Hindenburg"" caught fire in New Jersey, highlighting a critical safety issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a hydrogen-filled dirigible would catch fire while at the Empire State Building, it could be very dangerous for both the building and the pedestrians below, creating a significant public safety hazard. The last obstacle was a legal one. ""...existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for any aircraft to fly even remotely close to the Empire State Building, effectively grounding the ambitious plan before it could properly begin. In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, and these challenges ultimately prevented the concept from becoming a practical reality."
982	15815	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by the author, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when constructing the dirigibles dock. One is the winds and the safety of the building and people. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire State Building was neither practical nor safe,"" as the erratic gusts made stable docking nearly impossible. Another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" creating a legal blockade to the entire operation. There was also another problem. It was the building's structure and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast, reinforcing the steel framework to bear the immense load and stress from a moored airship. These combined issues of safety, law, and structural integrity presented a formidable series of challenges to the project's success."
983	15816	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was how would they be able to have a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, without ""adding stress to the building framework."" They couldn't just add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Consequently, they had to find a solution, which was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building, costing over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. Also ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" making the 101st floor a glassed-in observation area and the 102nd floor an open observation platform to serve a dual purpose. These structural and design considerations were central to the initial plans for the mooring mast."
984	15817	6	3	"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first reason why builders had difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The gas that filled the balloons was highly flammable; if one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. The text states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."" in the turbulent air, making a secure connection perilous. Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre-existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas, which directly conflicted with the docking procedure. These three main obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, and the mooring mast never became a practical reality because of these significant challenges."
985	15818	6	3	"In the excerpt, some obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at 1,250 ft., a fact which itself presented unique engineering and logistical challenges. Another problem they encountered was that the dirigibles were unsafe. The Hindenburg disaster, an event where a hydrogen-filled dirigible had caught fire, occurred during construction, casting a dark shadow over the entire concept. What if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York? The whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous following this tragic event. Finally, there were laws saying that no aircraft could be that close to the city, which legally prevented the implementation of the docking plan. The whole idea of the ""future of travel"" was very unliked and impractical due to these combined factors of public fear, safety concerns, and legal restrictions, leading to the eventual abandonment of the concept."
986	15819	6	3	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, height of the structure, stability of the structure, and worrying about the highly flammable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the powerful and unpredictable winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings and causing catastrophic damage. The structure needs to be stable at its great height so the massive dirigible doesn't knock over the Empire State Building during the docking process. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was necessary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught on fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch on fire, leading to a devastating urban inferno. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used for its intended purpose."
987	15820	6	3	"One of the big problems facing docking dirigibles is the government and the law. It is illegal to have such a low-flying aircraft over a densely populated city. It says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle would be public safety. Dirigibles are FLAMMABLE and could easily injure and kill people if an accident happened, posing an unacceptable risk to the city below. It is too dangerous, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS2. @NUM2). Another problem is nature and weather. The winds up there are extremely high and powerful, creating a big danger to dirigibles attempting to dock. The author notes, ""... violent air currents... back of the ship would swivel around... high above pedestrians,"" (@CAPS2. @NUM3), illustrating the uncontrollable and hazardous nature of the operation. These combined legal, safety, and environmental challenges ultimately proved insurmountable for the project."
988	15821	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve, envisioning it as a revolutionary air terminal. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle, overwhelmed by the technical difficulties. The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak proved practically impossible due to the fierce and unpredictable winds. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles, which used volatile hydrogen gas. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock, creating a regulatory barrier. The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting one and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and the obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it, leaving it as a fascinating but unused architectural feature."
989	15822	6	3	"The empire state building was high in the air, (@NUM1 ft) the problems were is that the building moves while it's in the air, and if you have something that is weighing around the heavy fifty-thousand pounds maybe more than the building might rip off if there is a big windstorm, causing structural failure. The dock sounded like a good idea but you would need a winch and you would have to put some big clamps on the building to secure the balloon or dirigible to dock and refuel, requiring extensive and untested modifications. In paragraph @NUM2, @PERSON1 of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" If Irving ever decides to put a blimp up and make an air station then he would need to make new technology to overcome these fundamental issues. Who know's in the future we could have cars that fly through air, why not have balloons attached to buildings, but for now, the engineering and safety challenges remain too great."
990	15823	6	3	They could not put a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, as it would add immense stress to the building's frame. The sheer force exerted by such a large and buoyant airship, especially when buffeted by winds, would place a dangerous and unpredictable load on the structural integrity of the skyscraper. This fundamental engineering problem of managing the dirigible's weight and the dynamic forces it would generate made the concept unfeasible from a structural standpoint. The potential for catastrophic failure was simply too high to proceed with the mooring mast plan.
991	15824	6	3	"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. Such obstacles included; the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flammability of the hydrogen if in it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area. The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress of the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also. The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building but cause the dirigible itself to not be able to stay in one place. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flammability. And since the dirigible is so close to people, such as tourists on the building's observation deck, the dirigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly, the dirigible is so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity. For example, when the Los Angeles tested the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and its mooring mast for docking dirigibles. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct."
992	15825	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced very difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most difficult obstacles was ""nature itself"". There were very strong winds that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the dirigible would move around and around even if it were ""tethered to the mooring mast"", making a stable and safe docking procedure nearly impossible. Also, dirigibles usually landed in open landing fields and would be weighted down with lead weights to secure them. However, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about 1,250 feet in a place as densely populated as New York City would be ""neither practical nor safe"", posing a grave danger to the public below. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", meaning the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unpractical from a legal standpoint as well. These combined factors of nature, safety, and law ultimately made the concept unworkable."
993	15826	6	3	When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building there were many challenges architects and builders had to overcome. First were the basic problems of any transportation hub, how to move people and baggage around the terminal efficiently and safely. Another more complicated problem was how to compensate for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This problem was solved by @MONEY1 redesign of the Empire State Building frame to handle the immense forces. Also, moored dirigibles would be constantly swinging around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below if they were to fall. The architects could not design a way to hold the dirigible in place securely against the powerful gusts. Eventually the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building was scrapped entirely after these fundamental issues proved insurmountable.
994	15827	6	3	"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well, creating a significant structural challenge. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand without major and costly reinforcements. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe."" As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building and leading to the abandonment of the plan."
995	15828	6	3	Well, since this one obstacle in their expanded use in New York City was the lack of landing area for the dirigibles, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service. And to let the passengers on and off there also. The Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of ship then tied to the Mast. But, then yet the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress of these Dirigibles load and the wind pressure would transmit all the way to the building's Foundation, creating a serious engineering concern. The steel Frame of the building should be strengthened or modified to accommodate this new situation, but even with such modifications, the fundamental challenges of wind and urban proximity remained, ultimately proving the concept to be impractical for regular use.
996	15829	6	3	The builders faced many challenging obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. The builders first talked with influential figures such as Al Smith to try to make the Empire State building the tallest building in the state, so it would be a great forefront for travelers, and they got it up high to @NUM1 feet. But now their obstacle was to have a dirigible reach the top point of the empire state building. Al Smith wanted for the top of the empire state building to be a landing area, where they could go refueling for hours, or service, and to let passengers on or off the dirigible. This required a specialized mast and a secure method for the airships to tether. So that was one of the obstacles that the builders had to face, to make it work, a complex task that tested their engineering ambitions.
997	15830	6	3	In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and engineers stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building, potentially weakening its integrity. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings, increasing the project's overall cost. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, raising serious public safety concerns. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.
998	15831	6	3	The Empire state building faced different stages of development and public perception. They @CAPS1 to make it to be fixed a little bit in order to enhance its functionality and appeal. Because it was the tallest building at the time and they so @CAPS1 it a more famous landmark, these adjustments were part of its ongoing legacy. The building thus evolved through various phases to secure its iconic status.
999	15832	6	3	"Based on the expert, the builders had many obstacles that the builders had to face, from attemting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders had to face was the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommidate the situation, requiring significant structural reinforcement. The builders also had a problem with the wind because ""... the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, wich would puncture the dirigibles shell,"" creating a hazardous docking environment. These combined issues presented a formidable challenge to the project's feasibility."
1000	15833	6	3	"In the reading comprehension ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock because they wanted to add the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof and the dirigibles would be able to take the mooring mast up to the top of the building. The architects found out that if they put the mooring mast on the top of the building its gonna bring stress to the building's foundation, posing a significant risk to its structural stability. This fundamental engineering concern was a major hurdle in realizing the ambitious docking plan."
1001	15834	6	3	Architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the man who wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, was very spacey. Some were as long as one thousand feet in length. So a mooring mast sounds fitting. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel as well as letting the passengers off and on.Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire S Building's owners to realize how bad it would be if it happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building is always changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the streets. Another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building.On December 1930, U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to forceful winds. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the controls in fear. In the late 1930's, the idea disappeared to be replaced by airplanes, marking the end of this ambitious but impractical venture.
1002	15835	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. These obstacles included having to redesign and modify the building structure, the dangers of a dirigible catching fire, the swirling winds, and state law. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" This was because the building was not originally built to have that capability. This meant, in order to do this meant over sixty thousand dollars in modification had to be spent. Another obstacle faced was the natural dangers of a dirigible. Dirigibles have a likely chance of catching fire, as displayed by the Hindenburg. If that same accident were to happen over the densely populated area of New York it would be a catastrophe. Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back the ship would swiveled around, and around the mooring mast"" This would just be dangerous to have something that large spinning round and round. The last obstacle faced by builders was that state law prohibited aircraft flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it illegal for the mooring mast to be used. This probably should have been considered. Overall poor planning created very many obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there, ultimately dooming the project from the start."
1003	15836	6	3	Architects struggled with obstacles as they were constructing the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame. The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the building had been framed, the roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The mast had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed, rendering the entire endeavor a costly and impractical architectural feature.
1004	15837	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders had obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to think about how the mast would work. It said in paragraph nine ""the architects could not simply drop a morning mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The buiders had to modify the building. ""As it said in paragraph ten ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast with out any ornamentation, the architects designed a shinny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower that would be illinated frome inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the over all shape of the building itself."" The obstacles the builders overcame let them use the mast efectly, though its intended function was never realized in practice."
1005	15838	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One of the main causes was nature. Winds/air current was a big risk. ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shall..."" This was a problem that no one could fix, no one can controll wind. Another big impact in the bunch of the mooring mast was law. ""The other practical reason why the dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" This law would make it impossible to ever make it a full use of transportation. These obstacles architects couldn't overcome, and the original idea for the project was soon forgotten, leaving the mast as a monument to a failed vision."
1006	15839	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some significant problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the primary problems was that the airships didn't really have adequate landing gear. It was very hard to land a dirigible on the ground, but in mid air it was almost impossible to achieve a stable connection. Another reason was it was very unsafe for the pilots involved. The pilot of the dirigible would have to land it about @NUM1 feet in the sky and if they messed up the delicate maneuver they could potentially die. Another reason was that there was a specific law against airships from flying low over urban areas. This law made it explicitly illegal for people to attempt to land it up there. Ultimately, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable problems when trying to make a functional dock for dirigibles, leading to the concept's abandonment.
1007	15840	6	3	"There were many obstacles workers faced when building the Empire State Building: making the structure the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable. Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the @CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, as his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was initially planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a secret spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The intense competition had truly begun. When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted it to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people and serve a function. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration later proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that such a chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The impressive tip was still being added though, which put the Empire State Building at a final height of 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building. The significant @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the powerful elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds at its summit. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the very top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with sturdy steel, the structure still holds today against the forces of nature. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible at the time, but they ultimately created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day, a testament to their achievement."
1008	15841	6	3	There were three main @CAPS1 that the builders faced: safety, Nature and THE LAW. The first obstacle that they faced was safety concerning the airships' design. Many blimps used Hydrogen instead of Helium for lift. While Helium is a @CAPS2 and safe gas, Hydrogen is a @CAPS3 which are highly combustible and posed a great risk. The second obstacle they faced was Nature and its unpredictable power. The strong @CAPS4 winds blew the Blimps off target and because they weren't aero dynamic, it was @CAPS5 to manever them with any precision. The third obstacle was a legal one, a law that stated that Blimps can't fly too low over cities, so if the other @CAPS1 didn't exist, it would still be illegal to attempt a docking. In conclusion, they Should Have built a @CAPS6 for a different purpose because @CAPS7 are simply better and safer than Blimps for urban travel.
1009	15842	6	3	Some obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was that the building itself was not initially stable enough to be able to moor a large airship safely. They solved this particular issue easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton for the entire structure. Another significant obstacle that they faced was the problem of high speed winds at that altitude and being able to get passengers off and on the dirigible while it was moored. They never did solve this fundamental problem, and so the entire mooring project was eventually shut down. The obstacles the builders faced were simply too many and this ambitious project soon became impossible to finish successfully and it never was used for its intended purpose.
1010	15843	6	3	"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a complete failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith was convinced it would be a commercial success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't fully considering that ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have occurred in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the fact that ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and combined with the enormous size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other nearby buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3) and it would most likely to happen since there are many buildings closely to one another in New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; the venture failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, all of his elaborate plan's failed by the end."
1011	15844	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles during their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was the structure of the building itself. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building and held by a single cable tether would add significant stress to the building's frame. The combined stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would, ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"", which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, a complex and costly engineering challenge that ultimately proved to be a major impediment to the plan."
1012	15845	6	3	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was nature. That is because the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was changing a lot due to bad weather, creating unpredictable and violent air currents. The blimp would be moving around dangerously even if it was tied down. The other challenge was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". That is not safe because if a blimp caught on fire at the building, there are 102 floors that could burn down. Also, because downtown New York is a very densely populated place, a fire would pose a grave risk to the public. That is the obstacles the Empire State Building faced in creating a docking area for blimps, making the venture exceptionally hazardous."
1013	15846	6	3	"The mooring mast atop the Empire State Building's problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying uncontrollably in the wind. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg disaster, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to these predictable obstacles."
1014	15847	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. For one, just letting a thousand-foot dirigible land on the top of a building was a huge obstacle in itself. By having the dirigible on the building held on by one cable tether was bad, as it concentrated all the forces on a single point. So the builder had to work on the steel frame of the building so that the dirigible wouldn't add so much stress to the building's structure, requiring significant and costly reinforcements. That was a huge obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to face, highlighting the immense structural challenges involved in the ambitious plan."
1015	15848	6	3	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which they were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building, making it the tallest. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point, allowing the blimp to spin around dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians below. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely impractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws, as winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project from its very inception."
1016	15849	6	3	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was finding a way to tether the end of the blimp without it blowing in the wind or putting the people below in danger, as the high winds at that altitude made securing the massive airship incredibly difficult. Another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, which created significant regulatory hurdles. One final obstacle was the inherent danger of hydrogen dirigibles in general, given the gas's extreme flammability. These obstacles proved far too many to outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast, ultimately rendering the concept unworkable.
1017	15850	6	3	One of the obstacles that the builders had to face was they had to make the building taller because it was supposed to be the tallest building in the world, a key part of its design and prestige. They also had problems with the structural integrity of the mooring mast itself, so they had to keep fixing it and reinforcing the design. These continuous challenges and necessary adjustments contributed to the overall difficulties of the ambitious project, which was eventually abandoned as impractical.
1018	15851	6	3	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York, where The Empire State Building is located, is such a crowded and densely populated area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area, potentially causing catastrophic damage. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to, overlooking key safety measures. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area, leading to massive loss of life and property. That's the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, an obstacle that ultimately proved insurmountable.
1019	15852	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The number one obstacle was safety. The builders thought to themselves, How are we going to safely land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground, while its freely floating in midair? Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets, where a single mistake could be disastrous. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives on the streets below. Its much easier landing dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, you're planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesn't move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded. These obstacles were real and these are some of the reasons why the idea of landing a dirigible in mid-air slowly went away, because it wasn't the most logical or safe idea.
1020	15853	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are the law against airships flying that low near buildings. They also faced structural problems in reinforcing the building to be able to hold a massive dirigible securely. They also could not keep the dirigibles from moving because of the strong wind currents at that height. They faced safety issues because some dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and it is highly flammable, posing a constant fire risk. They did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area like Manhattan. They did not want what happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey to happen in down town New York, a tragedy that highlighted the extreme dangers involved. Dirigibles have never docked there and never will because it is fundamentally unsafe, a conclusion reached after considering all these formidable challenges.
1021	15854	6	3	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" describes the creation of The Mooring Mast and its purpose in extending the height of the Empire State Building. During the 1930s, the concept involved the Mooring Mast serving as a docking area for dirigibles, which are also known today as blimps. After the 85th-floor frame was built and the skeleton of the mast, constructed from steel and featuring stainless steel glass windows, was completed, issues concerning the landing of dirigibles arose within the public. There were several major reasons why the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never really completed. One reason was safety. The excerpt explains how dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and using hydrogen is extremely flammable. They used the example of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed because it was on fire in New Jersey. The second reason was the problem of wind currents. Winds were extremely violent at that altitude. Dirigibles would move and sway a great deal because of the strong winds, and the moving dirigibles, being at least several hundred feet long, dangled high above urban areas which was not safe at all for people walking below. Thirdly, the issue of it being against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas was also a safety hazard for people. It would be illegal for dirigibles to be tied up on a mooring mast above cities filled with people, risking that a ship might fall onto the populace, ultimately rendering the entire concept impractical."
1022	15855	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, was determined to create the tallest building in the world; even taller than the Chrysler building. He also wanted the building to be aesthetically pleasing and nothing ordinary. His determination led him to the idea of the mooring mast, which in itself came with additional obstacles. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This meant that the frame would have to be significantly modified and strengthened to handle such immense forces. Other obstacles included the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable and could have caused a giant chaotic mess if over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" meaning that even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel everywhere, which was ""neither practical nor safe."" These combined challenges proved insurmountable for the ambitious docking plan."
1023	15856	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle the builders encountered was the dirigible's ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame"". The frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work, requiring significant engineering changes. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable. Anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in grave danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire, creating a public safety risk. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds, making stable mooring impossible. The mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked as intended."
1024	15857	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders couldn't just let the dirigible land on top of the Empire State building, as it would put too much pressure on the building's structure. According to the text, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" It would have cost sixty thousand dollars worth of modification that had to be made to the framework to handle the load. Another obstacle they feared was they noticed how much worse it would be if the dirigible caught on fire on top of the Empire State Building. It would destroy part of the population because it would be in downtown New York, a densely packed area. In the text, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. It says even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the State building, where they would dangle above pedestrians, was simply not safe or feasible."
1025	15858	6	3	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building. The building originally was going to have a flat roof, but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast, which altered the design. Another problem the builders faced was getting their idea of docking dirigibles approved by experts. The Department of Commerce had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations to assess the plan. The safety of the passengers of the dirigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be designated to passengers for ticketing and boarding. Experts had to design a door strong enough to carry people and also find a way to fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds, presenting significant engineering difficulties that were never fully resolved.
1026	15859	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to think about the safety of allowing the dirigibles and their passengers dock there. They had to think about the winds at the top of the building, which presented a significant challenge. The wind currents change violently at the top of the building and because they wouldn't be able to weigh the back of the ship down, the dirigible would spin around and around the mooring mast, creating a highly unstable and dangerous situation. They also had to think about dirigibles from other countries, which introduced a separate set of risks. These dirigibles used hydrogen which is more flammable then the helium ships, thereby increasing the potential for a catastrophic fire. These combined factors made the entire concept fraught with peril.
1027	15860	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although this sounded like a great idea and seemed possible at first, it was not. The idea of the mooring mast of the @CAPS1 State Building was neither practical nor safe. In paragraph fourteen, Marcia states why this dirigible idea wasn't so safe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would make it nearly impossible for a large airship to remain securely attached. In the last sentence of paragraph fourteen, the author states another reason the idea wasnt safe nor practical. ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" posing a direct threat to public safety below. Ultimately, the visionary plan was abandoned as unworkable."
1028	15861	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to dock dirigibles on the mast. One major problem was that the original Empire State Building, ""...could not simply drop a mooring mast,"" on the top of the building because the ""...single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame work to address this structural concern. One reason dirigibles were never docked on the mooring mast was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" This makes it impossible for dirigibles to even approach the mass without being impaled by other buildings. There was also, ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made it illegal to even dock airships on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles contain hydrogen which is ""highly flammable."" If the Hindenburg incident had taken place in New York, the accident would have been ""much worse."" These reasons contributed to the builders' problems, and explain why the mooring mast was never used for its intended purpose."
1029	15862	6	3	The builders of the empire state building could not build the moor mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of Empire state building was to flat, which presented an unsuitable landing surface. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building, ensuring the structure could withstand immense forces. They design the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers, envisioning a grand terminal in the sky. However it has a lot of problems for the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse, though this is a misconception as helium is inert. They think greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air current, so it can pratact from worst accident but it is still not safe enough for regular operations.
1030	15863	6	3	"Intended uses for buildings often are met with challenges. In the article ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by @PERSON1, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are discussed. The first obstacle faced is stated in paragraph @NUM1, when to build a dock on top of the building the entire building would have to be inforced. This was an obstacle because it would be at a cost of @MONEY1, a significant financial investment. Another obstacle faced was the weather. Above the building violent air currents rage, creating a treacherous environment. These currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring, making a stable connection impossible. The final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law. According to the article, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The cost of reinforcing the building, the weather, and the laws were three obstacles faced in docking blimps to the Empire State building that ultimately proved insurmountable."
1031	15864	6	3	"The workers constructing the Empire State Building faced many problems while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles, two of which were that the winds at that height were unpredictable and foreign dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to Violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock up that high. The high winds could cause loosening of the dirigible which could cause it to go flying off, which is unsafe to the pedestrians below. Also, ""Most dirigibles from out side of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard the workers ran into. If something were to go wrong, such as a spark from the building's structure, the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down to a large amount of pedestrians. These two are reasons or problem workers ran in to when deciding whether to not it would be safe or easy for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast uptop the Empire State Building, ultimately proving the concept to be fraught with danger."
1032	15865	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off @CAPS1 is a major concern many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive, posing a grave fire risk over the densely populated city. Second off the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible for the pilots attempting to maneuver the large, lightweight airships. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding @CAPS2 from flying to low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace, creating a legal barrier to the project's operation. The main obstecals the builders faced were @CAPS1 concerns, high winds and the illegality of thier project, which together made the ambitious plan unworkable in practice.

Paragraph @NUM1 states that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame.""

1034	15867	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it nearly impossible for a pilot to maintain a stable position. Also the ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe,"" as a dropped weight would have catastrophic consequences. Another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas, which directly prohibited the required flight path for docking. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, rendering the mast an architectural feature rather than a functional port."
1035	15868	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are in many ways. In my own opinion I think the Empire State Building is familiar to different people but not many knows the purpose to serve a landing spot for dirigibles. For an example ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" meaning a single accident could lead to a fiery catastrophe in the heart of New York City. In conclusion that is one way how they faced the obstacles.In another way how the obstacles and builders of the Empire State Building faced to attemting to all dirigibles to dock there is by transportation. In my own opinion transportation allows people to go to one place to another, For an a example ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future."" The quote that I have just stated means that it allows passengers to go places where they want to, but the inherent dangers at the building's summit prevented this future from being realized there. In conclusion, those are two examples the describes the obstacles and that allow dirigibles to dock there, showing how safety concerns and practical challenges outweighed the visionary goal."
1036	15869	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are lack of a suitable landing area. In the excerpt they said ""The one obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was the climate like wind pressure. For example they said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". This structural challenge was compounded by the unpredictable and powerful winds at such a great height, which made stable docking a significant concern. The next obstacle is dirigibles from outside of the United States. The dirigibles German's use hydrogen which is flammable. They said ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This inherent danger posed a serious risk to the building and the city below. Thats obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unworkable."
1037	15870	6	3	"Based on the article, ""the Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. @ORGANIZATION2 states in paragraph @NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been aparent before it was ever constructed."" One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, thats wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable and created a substantial fire hazard. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible, making a safe and secure connection to the mast nearly impossible. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because its illegal. There is a law against airships fly too low over urban areas and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was illegal. This legal prohibition presented an insurmountable barrier. There were many obstacles the builders went through, which collectively ensured the mooring mast would remain unused for its intended purpose."
1038	15871	6	3	Just like in life there are many obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention that can't be easy. So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong and unpredictable. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians, creating a major public safety risk.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them, as the dangers and difficulties ultimately outweighed any potential benefits.
1039	15872	6	3	The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time, a significant engineering challenge. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land, requiring precise design and construction for the mooring mast. The structure needed to withstand not only the building's own weight but also the additional forces from a docked airship. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building, though this envisioned use never truly came to pass as planned.
1040	15873	6	3	While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground, creating an immediate legal barrier. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe and posed a catastrophic risk. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object, leading to potential disaster. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen, a concept flawed from its inception by these critical oversights.
1041	15874	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced too many challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. First, there was the matter of safety. If a hydrogen zeppelin were to catch fire over New York City, it would be disastrous, potentially igniting a huge city fire and causing catastrophic loss of life. Also, the wind was capricious up there, and would make it extremely difficult to dock and stay docked. The Navy tried to, but was unsuccessful, because the wind did not allow for them to even get close to the mast, demonstrating the practical impossibility of the task. Third, there were laws preventing airships from flying too low over cities, which really put an end to the whole idea by making the operation illegal. The plan was dangerous from the start, albeit a really awesome one, and ultimately proved to be entirely impractical.
1042	15875	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below, posing a major structural engineering challenge. But the greatest obstacle was the wind, which would constantly shift, due to violent air currents at such a high altitude. These unpredictable gusts made any attempt to secure a massive, buoyant aircraft to the mast a perilous endeavor, effectively dooming the ambitious plan from the outset.
1043	15876	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION1 the builders faced obstacles to allow dirigible to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle that the builders faced is the lack of suitable landing area on the roof. For that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible, leading them to later put a steel needle on top of the empire State building so the balloons could dock up and let people out. Next obstacle that they faced was that ""outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building and caused immense destruction. Another reason of an obstacle is that it was against the law for airships flying too low over urban areas for it can tie up and forceful winds will blow it in different directions. For that reasoning the winds could force the balloon to go in different directions and hit other building if the winds are strong, creating a clear hazard. Those are the obstacles the builders faced in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, which collectively prevented the concept from ever becoming a reality."
1044	15877	6	3	"The success of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was prevented by many obstacles. Safety was one of the greatest reasons because ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was flammable."" @CAPS1 starting in a densely populated city like New York could damage a lot of people and property. Nature also proved to be an obstacle because ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" that was neither practical nor safe for passengers or the structure. It would also be difficult to control the dirigible once it is tied to the mast because of the violent motion that the dirigible is in, making a stable connection nearly impossible. There was also an existing law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it illegal for any dirigible to even get near the mooring mast or tie to it, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. All of these obstacles were faced by the builders of the mooring mast, which eventually led to the disregarding of the idea of using the mooring mast for ships, rendering the famous spire a monumental but unused feature."
1045	15878	6	3	Based on the exerpt, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all for nothing. They spent extra money to restruture things but there was no need, as the fundamental concept was flawed from the beginning. Even if they found some way to get the dirigibles to dock, it was already illegal for aircraft to fly that close to cities, making the entire venture an exercise in futility. The mast itself thus became a costly architectural feature that never served its intended purpose, a testament to a visionary but ultimately impractical idea.
1046	15879	6	3	Though the idea to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was seriously considered, safety and reality made it an unrealistic feat. In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold a dirigible, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the framework of the building itself, a costly and complex undertaking. Still, numerous @CAPS1 got in the way, the greatest being public safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen gas rather than helium, which is highly flammable and prone to ignition. The owners of the Empire State building realized how catastrophic a dirigible fire would be, and more so if it took place directly over the densely populated city of New York. Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship would swing around violently, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea for obvious reasons. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allowed airships to fly low, or too close to urban areas, effectively prohibiting the operation. Even if it was attempted, ships would have a hard time docking because of the consistently forceful winds. These @CAPS1 were all stumbled across in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, an ambitious idea that is no longer considered feasible.
1047	15880	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking procedure itself. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable and volatile. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, such as a spark, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it, resulting in a major disaster. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up, creating an unstable environment. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building to secure a line. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas for safety reasons. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles, ultimately dooming the concept."
1048	15881	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we are informed of the many obstacles standing in the way of landing a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle can be found in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than hellium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" As you can see the use of hydrogen would provide a great hazard to New York City as a dirigible was landing on the top of the building, risking a massive fire. It is a highly populated spot and could be potentially very dangerous for the thousands of people below. Another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph @NUM2. It stated that ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" specifically @CAPS1 to the wind. L¸sted informs us of the terrible hazard of the unpredictable air currents at the top of the Empire State Building, which could easily throw a ship off course. All in all, many obstacles stood in the way for allowing dirigibles to dock, and in the end that is why it wasn't successful and the plan was abandoned."
1049	15882	6	3	The Empire State Building was meant to be great, the tallest building in the world. Although they did achieve their goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used. The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air ships called dirigibles, a visionary concept for its time. However this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever built. One of the greatest obstacles was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safely secure, making stable mooring impossible. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical and dangerous for the streets below. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, creating a legal blockade. But two ships did try to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous due to the gusting winds. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles, and the mast became a landmark instead.
1050	15883	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the added, stress to the buildings frame. The excerpt states in paragraph nine ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This obstacle would could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and alot of destruction throughout the city. Another obstacle included nature and its unpredictable forces. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air current could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it, creating a cascade of damage. The stress being added to the Empire State building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders, proving the plan to be unworkable."
1051	15884	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to face a lot of obstacles to try to get dirigibles to land there. One of those obstacles was making ""changes to existing Plans for the building's stelfame,"" which required significant structural reinforcement to support the immense weight and force of a docked airship. Another thing was nature; the powerful and unpredictable winds at such a great height would not let a blimp land there securely. But the greatest reason was safety: ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable,"" creating an unacceptable risk of a catastrophic fire at the top of the world's tallest building. Ultimately, the combination of these formidable challenges proved insurmountable, and the ambitious plan was abandoned."
1052	15885	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully, which was a difficult feat of engineering at such an extreme altitude. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area,"" rendering the mooring mast obsolete. Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes, which became the dominant form of air travel."
1053	15886	6	3	"The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was there was a it was illegal for ""airships to fly to low"" over urban areas. It was illegal for it to ""tie up to the building."" The purpose of the dirigibles was to be able to dock at the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame, posing a serious structural risk. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation, a costly and complex endeavor. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan for the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented, saving considerable time and resources."
1054	15887	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock there. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to keep it afloat. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and has proven to be; on @DATE1 a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire caused from hydrogen, in New jersey. When the owners of the Empire State building realized the severity of this happening they were turned off from the idea. Nature if anything was the biggest obstacle of them all. Considering the building was so tall, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents,"" making a stable docking procedure nearly impossible. The law if anything was pretty important to get approved, and there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So it would make it illegal for the dirigible ships to ever tie up to the building or to even approach the area, which ultimately sealed the fate of the project."
1055	15888	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles, a major redesign so late in the process. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street. The design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these challenges collectively ensured the concept never became a practical reality."
1056	15889	6	3	they had to worry about the safety for the people, to keep it still as they docked. How they would manage it and the possible outcomes if something did go wrong were constant concerns. The process required meticulous planning to ensure the vessel remained stable and secure throughout the docking maneuver, minimizing any risk to the passengers and crew on board. Every eventuality had to be considered to prevent a disastrous outcome.
1057	15890	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obstacles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to, structural integrity, and design. Since ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Building's flat roof,"" The builders had to modify the building's frame. These modifications cost over a considerable sum and involved reinforcing the core structure to bear the additional load. The other aspect that posed an obstacle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank. So, to fulfill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside. This required a lot of extra work for the builders, including intricate metalwork and the installation of specialized lighting systems. Despite the obstacles, the builders got the job done, creating a landmark feature for the skyscraper."
1058	15891	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being that the architects could not have a mooring mast on top of the building because the dirigible would be, ""... held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". This would cause the building to have too weak of a frame from the dirigible's load, as well as the wind pressure. Then the stress would be transmitted down to the foundation of the building, threatening its overall stability. As a result, the building's frame was modified, costing ""Over sixty thousand dollars'"". Another obstacle was designing the mooring mast, so passengers could be brought, ""... down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located"". In order for this to be completed, builders had to complete the roof and construct a secure passenger gangway. Lastly, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moor mast was nature itself"". When the winds came into action at the top of the building, the dirigible would swivel around the mast. This would cause a safety hazard for pedestrians on the street below from the unstable airship. The Mooring Mast supported many reasons as to the obstacles builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building."
1059	15892	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author, the author describes many obstacles builders faced, to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the modifications that had to made to the buildings framework. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,"" showing how expensive this project was going to be and the significant structural changes required. A second potential problem was that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many different complications. One of which would be how ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" a consequence feared by the pilot of Los Angeles. Another problem brought up by the winds shifting, would be the ship spinning, potentially resulting in catastrophe for the craft and the building. They accommodated for the use with unpractical things, eventually leading to the downfall of the mooring mast as a functional concept."
1060	15893	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders and architects building the Empire State Building had numerous problems trying to build the mast on the top of the building. One reason was that they built it before even considering the problems it may cause, a significant oversight in planning. The biggest problem was safety: ""the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable,"" creating an immense fire risk. Another problem was wind: ""they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height."" If the dirigible was ever tied to the building, ""it's back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making a safe and stable connection nearly impossible. The dirigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights but using those a thousand feet above downtown New York would not be safe at all, posing a danger to the city below. The final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians, creating a legal barrier. So, needless to say, it wouldn't work out as originally envisioned."
1061	15894	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were many and complex. The architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the building that was only held by a single cable tether. This would add significant stress to the building's frame, a force for which it was not originally designed. To be able to handle the dirigible's load the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be extensively modified and strengthened, which was over sixty thousand dollars' worth of reinforcement. Another formidable obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were always shifting violently, which could lead to the back of the ship swiveling around and around the mooring mast, creating an unstable and dangerous situation for both the airship and the structure. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved too great to overcome for the ambitious docking plan.
1062	15895	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary obstacle that the architects faced was the immense stress the cable tether would put onto the building's foundation. As mentioned, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" presenting a very expensive problem to fix. Another critical challenge the builders faced was the inherent lack of safety. Dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse an accident could be if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Perhaps the number one obstacle builders faced was nature itself. The violent winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and even if the dirigible were tethered, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, which would be neither practical nor safe. Faced with such egregious obstacles, the idea had quietly disappeared."
1063	15896	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" it describes many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring mast of the building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. One prominent example is that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, while the United States mainly used helium, which is not flammable like hydrogen. Luckily, the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the building, posing a grave risk. Another major obstacle to the builders was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents, making docking maneuvers perilous. This made it unsafe not only for the airships but also for the pedestrians down below. These were the fundamental obstacles the builders had to contend with when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, leading to the concept's abandonment."
1064	15897	6	3	"Marcia's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the various obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Nobody involved initially realized the building wouldn't be sturdy enough to allow a thousand-foot dirigible to be docked there. The immense pressure from the airship, and the wind pressure, would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation."" The steel frame would also need to be heavily reinforced, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Several other problems arose due to pedestrian safety issues, notably that most foreign dirigibles used highly-flammable hydrogen fuel instead of the safer helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that should the hydrogen cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose their lives, especially since the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded streets, endangering countless pedestrians. Furthermore, there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Although the Empire State Building never got to fulfill its intended purpose, it ultimately became an international landmark in the heart of New York."
1065	15898	6	3	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders ran into obstacles that in the end prevented the whole idea from moving forward. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and because of these changing winds atop the building there would be no safe way to moor a lighter-than-air dirigible on top of such a high structure. The wind also posed another problem because if the captain let go of the controls the dirigible might spear itself atop another pointy spire, thus leading to the other high buildings themselves becoming an obstacle. The law of the day also became a significant obstacle, with ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even though the building itself was high up, it wasn't legal for any airship to moor there due to these height restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State building would have sent New York spiraling upward in the land of innovation, but the obstacles were simply too great to surpass."
1066	15899	6	3	"There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigible was the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close, preventing any legal approach. The second problem was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"" which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible as it swirled unpredictably. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage, a risk deemed unacceptable. These precautions and inherent dangers would have to be taken which were ultimately insurmountable obstacles for The Empire State Building, rendering the ambitious plan unfeasible."
1067	15900	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to derigibles. Most foreign derigibles still used hydrogen; a highly flammable gas, and a potential fire or explosion on the streets of New York would be disastrous. There were also fierce, ever changing wind currents above the building, creating a volatile and unstable environment for docking. These winds would make the back of the dirigible ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" posing a significant hazard to anyone attempting to board or disembark. @CAPS1, there was a law in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low when over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tether to the building or even approach it, creating a legal barrier to the plan's execution. Those three factors combined made the mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe,"" and the concept was ultimately abandoned."
1068	15901	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle they faced is the safety of the passengers when the dirigibles would dock and the frame work of the building wouldn't collapse under the immense strain. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 the excerpt says, ""'One set of egineers are here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.'"" The mast weighs alot so they're afraid it will put too much pressure on the empire state building's structural integrity. The egineers were also afraid of the dirigibles blowing up because the dirigibles use hydrogen. Hydrogen is way more flammable than helium, creating a severe fire hazard. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM3 and @NUM4 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" These were a few of many obstacles the workers faced, highlighting the significant safety and engineering challenges involved."
1069	15902	6	3	"In this excerpt the Architect/Workers had to face several obstacles while trying to construct a docking area on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. They had to find away for this huge mast not to kill the building frame The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add tremendous stress to the buildings frame."" They had to find away to make the load less bearing on the building, a complex engineering problem. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" To fix this Architects and Workers must modifie the steel frame because of the new situation, requiring extensive and costly reinforcements. After this was built and done they had to face the facts that this was imposible to do or not allowed due to other dangers. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects and worker went through so many obsticales to then find out its dangerous and the law not to fly so close to urban area's, ultimately making the entire venture impractical."
1070	15903	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders went through many obstacles. Dirigibles are steel frames balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Dirigibles could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rodders and passengers could ride in the gondola, under the balloon. A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, necessitating major structural work. over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework to handle these new forces. Also there was the law against airships flying to low over urban areas, presenting a legal hurdle. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, rendering the expensive structural modifications ultimately useless for their intended purpose.
1071	15904	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of The Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. They had to allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. The dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. While secured in this manner, the body of the dirigibles could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. They had to go through all these obstacles in order to build The Empire State Building, a testament to the ambitious vision behind its construction.
1072	15905	6	3	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York, led the way in constructing the Empire State Building. This building was being constructed to be the tallest building, taller than the Chrysler building which stood at a formidable height. In order to make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top for docking dirigibles. This idea faced many obstacles. First, the passage states that ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthen to accommodate this new situation."" This would cost a large amount of money to construct, adding a significant financial burden. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Furthermore, the passage states the issue that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed. The builders should have thought of each situation before building the mast which cost a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer used, the Empire State Building still stood as the tallest building built, a lasting symbol of ambition."
1073	15906	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal of creating a functional dirigible dock. They had failed to predict the potential problems that they would face. First of all, they couldn't proceed to attempt to land the dirigible on the mooring mast because it would be dangerous. Indeed, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They realized the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey, which highlighted the grave risks. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents."" Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets and buildings below. As a final point, dirigibles wouldn't be able to moor at the Empire State Building because there was a pre-existing law concerning how low airships could fly over urban areas, rendering the entire concept impractical from a legal standpoint."
1074	15907	6	3	The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed as a practical venture. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable and posed an immense fire hazard. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction, making a stable docking procedure nearly impossible. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal, a combination of factors that doomed the ambitious plan from the start.
1075	15908	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to deal with regarding the dirigible docking plan. They had to make sure the dirigibles could go high enough and be safe for passengers to board and get off safely. The builders had to deal with a lot. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof."" Because of the building's height they were unable to make things work as intended. The dirigible was too much of a burden and it added stress to the building's frame, and to unload things it was too difficult as the floor it needed to be on was too low. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The project was so difficult that they had to quit the task and expand at another time, leaving the workers devastated by the failed endeavor."
1076	15909	6	3	"There were many significant problems to overcome in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first major problem was the immense stress a thousand-foot-long dirigible would add to the building's frame during docking. This critical structural issue was ultimately solved by spending over @MONEY1 in modifying and reinforcing the building's framework to bear the additional load. Another considerable problem was a specific law against airships flying too low around dense urban environments, a regulation brought up in paragraph @NUM1. However, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the powerful and unpredictable wind. At 1,250 feet high, the wind is particularly violent and would swing a massive dirigible around far too much to be considered safe, and the ship's ends could not be weighed down for fear of the lines injuring a pedestrian on the streets below. Those three significant reasons ultimately contributed to the mooring mast's failure as a practical venture."
1077	15910	6	3	In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building the builders faced many complex problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of the safer helium. The inherent problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flammable and would pose a huge risk to have a hydrogen-filled dirigible hovering over a city full of pedestrians because it could easily catch on fire and hurt them. Secondly, the winds at the extreme height of the Empire State Building's mast were always shifting violently, which presented a great risk to pilots attempting to dock. If their dirigible got blown off course it could easily collide with other tall buildings in the city. This danger was demonstrated when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other structures. Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the restricted airspace around the Empire State Building, creating a legal barrier to its use.
1078	15911	6	3	It @CAPS1 like a very hard test for them because they were trying to usher in a new age of transportation with the ambitious thoughts of the pioneers. But once the architects designed the specialized mooring mast and made the necessary structural changes for the building skeleton, the construction phase began. They had framed the 85th floor specifically to support the mast, and the roof had to be completed before the final framing of the mast could be finished, marking a complex sequence of work.
1079	15912	6	3	During 1929 when Al Smith announced that he was going to make a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building there were many formidable obstacles in the way of the architects' building design. Building a dock for blimps at the top of the world's tallest building is no easy task, presenting unique engineering challenges. They should have realized previous to the project that this was essentially a lost cause, but they tried it anyways, driven by the spirit of the era. The architects on the project had to devise a complex plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrollable wind conditions. Unfortunately they never found a viable way to successfully complete this task and because of that fundamental failure, the Empire State Building could never actually dock blimps as originally envisioned.
1080	15913	6	3	In the 1930's this would have been a difficult obstacle to face, as the technology and understanding were still developing. The ambitious idea altogether was doubted by many people from the outset. The first @CAPS1 was comparing the building in height with the Chrysler building, a fierce rivalry that pushed the design to its limits. The mooring mast would have worked in theory but in reality had too many practical Problems that could not be engineered away. It was a potentially dangerous attempt that ultimately proved to be unfeasible for safe and regular operation.
1081	15914	6	3	When the Empire State Building was constructed, it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City, fearing a catastrophic fire. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting, creating unpredictable gusts. Docking a dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers attempting to disembark. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled its intended purpose as a functional airship terminal.
1082	15915	6	3	The building of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was very poorly thought out. This is the reason why they faced so many obstacles from the outset. From the very start, Al Smith never adequately thought about the safety of the people on the ground or in the airships. When other countries used hydrogen rather than helium, this was a cause for very flammable possibilities. If a disaster happened in New Jersey, how much worse would it be in a densely populated place like New York City? I could never imagine walking down the street and a lead weight being dropped on my head from a swaying airship. In New York, there were violent air currents, and when the dirigibles would be tied up, they would sway dangerously. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights, but this was not practical or safe for anyone below. The one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law; it was illegal for an airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings. In conclusion, everything should have been thought out before making hype about something that was not safe and that was ultimately illegal.
1083	15916	6	3	"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it is easy to see the many complications with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 ft. building. For one, there is the natural effect of wind. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making stable approach and landing nearly impossible. Such winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere if the craft wasn't able to be weighted down securely. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a massive dirigible hundreds of feet long. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, requiring immense structural integrity. The workers then had to spend a significant amount of money to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building to handle these forces. Another critical issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal according to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All these safety troubles and legal violations would all together make the mooring operation an impossible feat to accomplish successfully."
1084	15917	6	3	The architects and builders faced large problems in the construction of the docking platform, even though they had not noticed them at first. The builders did not notice any large problem until after the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst, which was a tragic and fiery disaster. The building's owners then became greatly concerned for the safety of the people inside and below the building if a blimp fell into the same situation as the Hindenburg, leading to a reassessment of the entire mooring mast concept. This safety concern, brought to the forefront by the real-world catastrophe, ultimately contributed to the mast's failure as a functional docking station.
1085	15918	6	3	When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast, he had no idea how many obstacles they would face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would explode in flames, endangering everyone on board. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below who would be hit by falling debris. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This was a problem because it would cause the dirigible to move all over the place, making a secure docking procedure impossible. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below if they were to fall. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not originally capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast; without changing the design, the dirigible would probably tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it theoretically possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face, from safety and weather to structural integrity and cost.
1086	15919	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. One of the obstacles were the crowded skies they had for the dirigible. Crowded skies can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing, leading to a catastrophic accident. The wind could also make the dirigible sway and hit another building, as the air currents at such a height were unpredictable. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put a lot of tension on the building and something could go wrong, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the entire skyscraper. These significant challenges made the proposed dirigible docking operation exceptionally hazardous from the outset.
1087	15920	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they dealt with was the fact that mooring such heavy blimps would add stress to the building. In fact, 'the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,' requiring substantial and costly reinforcements to the steel frame. Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,' raining fire and debris onto the streets below. It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area, violating safety regulations. Lastly, the strong winds would making mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents,' which could violently swing the massive airship. The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast and it just couldn't be completed as a functional and safe facility.
1088	15921	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", There were multiple obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or ever approach the area, creating an immediate legal barrier. Another obstacle the builders faced was forceful winds. ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds,"" demonstrating the practical impossibility of the task. The greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making a secure connection unfeasible. The last obstacle was the dirigible wasn't safe to have dangling high above pedestrians, posing an unacceptable risk to the public. Ultimately, these combined issues proved insurmountable for the builders."
1089	15922	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by American Society of Civil Engineers, The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example One big problem they faced was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof."" This operation would not be possible because ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings foundation, which is nearly 11 hundred feet below."" the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, a massive and expensive undertaking. One big obstacle they faced was a big Safety problem. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable,"" creating a severe fire hazard over the city. the biggest obstacle to face was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but using them at the empire state building, were they would be hanging on top of pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. These are the obstacles the empire state building faced, which ultimately prevented the plan's success."
1090	15923	6	3	There were many obstacles the builder's of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles were the lack of a suitable landing area, as the urban environment offered no open space for such a large craft. Another obstacle was they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof, a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame, demanding a complete structural reassessment. Also if they wanted to do this, it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, requiring immense reinforcement. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making stable mooring a near impossibility. To reduce this dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, but the obstacle to this is having weights dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe, presenting an obvious public danger. All these obstacles, yet these people were still able to build the Empire State building with a mooring mast, even if it was never used for its intended purpose.
1091	15924	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles during its construction and the implementation of its unique feature. As stated in paragraph 1 of the excerpt, the Empire State building was planned to be the tallest building in the world in the @DATE2's. However, the architect of the Chrysler building secretly constructed that building to be 46 ft taller then the Empire State building. Governor of New York, Al Smith, who was closely associated with the project, did not want to loose the tittle of the tallest building. In paragraph 6 it tells you Smith's ambitious idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building which would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on & off. Unfortunately, significant safety issues did not allow the mooring mast of the Empire State building to fulfill its person, as said in paragraph @NUM1. Most dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. Because of the many pointy buildings in the area, this was extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM2; the greatest obstacle was nature itself. On top of the Empire State building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking maneuvers perilous. Also, there was the law against airships to fly too low over the city. By the late 1930's, after these numerous challenges, the mooring mast plan disappeared from practical use."
1092	15925	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced several complex obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, there was the significant problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building, held by a single cable tether which would add immense stress to the frame of the building, transmitting forces all the way to its foundation. To fix this critical issue, the entire steel frame of the Empire State building would need to be substantially strengthened. Another major problem was ensuring the safety of the citizens on the streets far below. Dirigibles using hydrogen, a common lifting gas, could easily burst into flames if a spark occurred. Also, the high winds at that altitude would make it exceptionally hard for the massive airship to tether securely to the mooring mast. Furthermore, the dirigible could not be effectively weighed down since any heavy weights would dangle dangerously over pedestrians on the streets. The dramatic effectiveness of these winds was clearly shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock. During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the dirigible rightly feared that his craft could be punctured by other buildings' sharp spires. Those are several key examples of what the builders of the Empire State building had to face in their ambitious endeavor.
1093	15926	6	3	Some obstacles the builders faced were the issue of too much stress to the building's frame from a docked airship. It would have to transmit all the weight and wind pressure all the way down to the building's foundation, posing a serious structural challenge. Also there would only be one cable, known as a tether, holding the massive dirigible in place, which was a significant risk. Another obstacle would be an existing aviation law saying that you cannot moor your ship there because you are flying too low over the city. In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible notably tried parking there but the crew were afraid of the strong wind knocking it into another nearby building. Therefor they went through a few hard obstacles in their planning, but in the end they fixed the structural concerns and made the mast a reality, even if its practical use was limited.
1094	15927	6	3	"Dirigibles, modernly called blimps, were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was, promising a new era of air travel. These dirigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passengers both efficiently and with a high degree of safety. At the very time these dirigibles became popular, modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building, came up with the innovative idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" by some, it was never put to regular use because of serious safety concerns found later by architects and engineers. These safety concerns included the fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" at that great height as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many insurmountable obstacles stood in its path to glory and it ultimately remained an unrealized vision."
1095	15928	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were extreme to over come. One significant obstacle for the builders was trying to make it so the building itself could handle the structural stress of the dirigibles tied to the top of the building, with wind pulling at it and the airship swaying back and forth as wind direction changes. Also, the location was considered too low for a dirigible to be flying safely because of the proximity of other tall buildings, creating a risk of collision. The most important safety concern, however, was that the gases inside many dirigibles was highly flamible hydrogen, and a fire would be devistation to the people below in the dense streets of New York City. These combined challenges proved too great for the mooring mast to ever become a functional reality.
1096	15929	6	3	The dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1 on @DATE1. The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. In The Mooring Mast, it is noted that dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling; some were as long as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, which made the risks of operating such large airships in a dense urban environment far too great to be practical.
1097	15930	6	3	"In the @DATE1's, Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's mooring system ran into many problems. One obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds caused the dirigible's tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offs. Another obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, a fear that was intensified because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York then the damage would have been catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly; hydrogen is extremely flammable and had a crash occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties, ultimately dooming the project."
1098	15931	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Constructed in the 1930s, the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building. Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project, and most of these issues were safety problems. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Another reason was the flammability of these ships, as most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed. In summation, because of these significant safety risks, the mast of the Empire State Building could and was never used for its original purpose."
1099	15932	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. As one source notes, ""... the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This means it was difficult to land the dirigibles safely in the urban environment. Another problem they faced was nature, as the wind and weather could make landing the dirigibles very dangerous. The text explains, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast."" (@CAPS1 6). This means if the wind blows in the wrong direction, or competes with the electric winch, it would be difficult and dangerous to land the dirigible. Another obstacle was the expenses involved. It is stated that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This means they had to pay a lot of money, which is an easy way to understand the financial challenge. That was definitely an obstacle they had to face, and these combined issues prevented the mooring mast from ever being successfully used."
1100	15933	6	3	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some significant problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was the wind conditions at such a great height. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speeds. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized the dangers were simply too high and the venture just wasn't worth it.
1101	15934	6	3	The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced were exceptionally harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land securely on the mooring mast, a complex problem of aeronautical engineering. A another problem was that the government was getting increasingly unpaticent, demanding progress. What made thing worse was Al smith was being sneaky and unturful, undermining the project's credibility. He lied about how high the actulty hieght is, inflating the number for publicity. He lied about how he will fix the problems the was with the mooring mast, offering false promises. They were also afraid that a dirigible will blowup on the mooring mast like the @CAPS1, creating a catastrophic fire in the city. So they just put it aside and made over time the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the use by the sightseers, repurposing the space entirely.
1102	15935	6	3	One problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough and structurally sound. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long, presenting a massive profile. If the just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building becaus the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame, threatening its integrity. If they did the weight of the dirigible and the wind all of that stress and pressure would be put on the buildings foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below which was not safe at all, risking a structural failure. They had to go through all of the different possibilities, evaluating each design carefully, and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe for the public. While designing the mast they had to consider the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents, making stable docking nearly impossible. If they did design a good mast the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe and posed an unacceptable public risk.
1103	15936	6	3	"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions, creating a chaotic environment. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow fly through the winds and could be tied to the mast it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, A dirigible is not leagally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" Which there is an ""existing law"" against, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast, rendering their efforts futile. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" a risk the city was unwilling to take. Because of potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with insurmountable obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."
1104	15937	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION3 the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. One reason that it was difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was safety issues. According to Marcia Amidon L¸sted, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With New York City and its dense population that is a risk that cannot be taken, as a fire would be catastrophic. Another obstacle faced by the architects of the Empire State Building was nature itself. The start of paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With high winds the dirigible, even tethered to the mast, would swivel around the mooring mast, making a stable connection impossible. Another difficulty in docking the dirigibles was according to the excerpt in paragraph @NUM2, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Due to this law it would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, creating a legal blockade. A final obstacle the builders faced was the advancement with airplanes and that made it difficult for dirigibles to be the prime source of aeronautical transportation, reducing the urgency for a docking station. Even though the builders spent a lot of time and effort in making the Empire State Building a national @CAPS1, which it is, they neglected many potential problems with the mooring mast which led to it never accomplish its full potential as a dirigible port."
1105	15938	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon l¸sted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional for several key reasons. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly, requiring specific gases for lift. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense, but they introduce a major hazard. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire, endangering the entire city. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population, a risk they could not justify. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure itself. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building, a significant engineering challenge. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure, a costly endeavor. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"", illustrating the financial burden. Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled and powerful. They often shift because of ""violent air current"", making any tethering operation perilous. No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe, swinging uncontrollably. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
1106	15939	6	3	The initial work to construct the Empire State Building faced many problems with building docks for dirigibles to land on docks attached to the Empire State building. The fundamental concept of using the skyscraper as an air terminal proved impractical from the start. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that dirigibles disappeared and did become the transportation of the future, overtaken by advancements in airplane travel. Consequently, the Empire State building never got to fulfill its purposes for dirigibles, and the grand vision for a midtown airship port was ultimately abandoned.
1107	15940	6	3	When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition with other skyscrapers. However, nobody predicted the significant obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the ambitious plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable, creating a substantial fire hazard. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places as densely populated as New York City. Another obstacle was the powerful wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers attempting to embark or disembark. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities, directly conflicting with the docking procedure. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose for commercial airship travel.
1108	15941	6	3	Based on the excerpt, obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were both structural and aesthetic. The primary challenge was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast and the forces of a docked airship. Furthermore, rather than building a purely utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. This focus on architectural beauty, while iconic, added another layer of complexity to the already difficult engineering task.
1109	15942	6	3	"Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many obstacles came forth with building the Empire State building with Al Smith constructing the whole project. With Al Smith constructing the whole building, he was determined to outstrip the height of his rivals. Al Smith secretly constructed a 185 foot spire inside the building, which shocked the media and public by hoisting it up to surpass the top of the Chrysler building. Another obstacle that was faced during the building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. With the idea of having the dirigibles docked at the top, they would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add enormous amounts of stress to the building's frame. The greatest obstacle that came to building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable and if anything were to happen it could destroy parts of New York. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles as described in the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."
1110	15943	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced several challenges in the completion of the landing dock for dirigibles. The first problem was the frame of the building itself. The frame was not strong enough to support the dirigibles when docked so they had to reinforce the frame to withstand the strain the dirigibles would present. The next problem was the lack of a suitable landing area. They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building but the violent winds at that altitude would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the anchor because of fear that the dirigible might be speared by a nearby building. Another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked is because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made the entire operation legally problematic. A couple of attempts have been made but to this day nobody has successfully docked a dirigible on top of the Empire State building, rendering the mast a monumental feature without a practical function.
1111	15944	6	3	"The Empire State Building is known for its great size and distinctive shape in New York City's skyline, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, and the law. The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights; however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph one, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, and if a blimp caught fire over densely populated Manhattan, this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, and ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph two). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over a thousand feet with pedestrians below. There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp docking. Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mast on the Empire State building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph four). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat."
1112	15945	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was that they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes to the building's framework because docking a dirigible on the building would put a lot of stress on the framework and foundation of the building, requiring significant structural reinforcement. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it is such a densely populated area. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle, as ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line five) This would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably, which would endanger pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas, creating a legal barrier to the operation. All of these obstacles collectively made docking a dirigible here an impossible endeavor."
1113	15946	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders found many obstacles on the way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. Some of those obstacles were as follow. The main concern was the safety of the passengers boarding and unboarding as well as the people below. The concern for the people below was how the dirigible sometimes was floating with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, so they didn't want chances of the dirigible blowing up. Another main concern was there was an ""existing law over airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph three). The dirigible floated with the air and being as long as eight hundred feet, the back of the dirigible where it wasn't securely fastened would circle around the mooring from the high wind currents. The winds were shifting all the time so it was a very big safety issue. Another obstacle was the dirigible docking was mainly put into place because of jealousy; the man was jealous because his competition Al Smith was catching up with him before the idea of a dirigible mooring mast came to mind, though this did not alleviate the practical dangers involved."
1114	15947	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. They were not going to do it because it might hit other buildings or fly into itself, posing a clear hazard. As stated, the airship ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (The New York Times, line seven). That meant it wasn't safe for the dirigible to approach the mast securely. The powerful and unpredictable winds at that altitude made any attempt at docking far too dangerous to attempt, leading to the ultimate abandonment of the plan for safety reasons."
1115	15948	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by T. H. Watkins, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was figuring out a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. Practicality and safety were an obstacle because the builders of the Empire State Building were the first to attempt docking dirigibles in the air; consequently, they had no past trials to refer to. In this project, practicality and safety worked together. For example, ""..engineers [had] to dope out a practical, workable arrangement..."" so that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and securely. This would assure the passengers' safety as well as stability for the building. The second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Directing all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation ""... was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation, ""the steel frame [of the building had] to be modified and strengthened..."" The modification to the building's framework was worth ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex obstacles in their attempt to dock dirigibles at their building, which ultimately proved insurmountable."
1116	15949	6	3	Al Smith and other workers are diligently working on the Empire State Building, but they have been facing a few obstacles with the project. For instance, they could not build it as high as they originally wanted. They had to fix the mast skeleton if they wanted to proceed with further plans, such as the Dirigibles. The issue with dirigibles was a significant one. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This danger was tragically illustrated when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. This event explains why they had subsequently gotten a law passed to prevent such a disaster from happening near urban areas. This proves that there were indeed significant challenges with the Empire State Building that they had to work around in order to proceed safely.
1117	15950	6	3	The obstacles that were faced by the Empire State Building builders were numerous and complex. First of all, if they had carried out their plans for the mooring mast without taking into account the immense weight of a docked dirigible, the building would surely have had way too much stress forced on its foundation. Next, the fact that the dirigible weighs even less than air presented both a negative and a positive aspect. The negative side to it is the fierce winds that would take control of the back of the airship, making it difficult to manage. Above the many pedestrians in the city, this idea was quickly ruled unsafe for public security. Lastly, the common use of hydrogen for lift was a major concern, which, naturally, is highly flammable. The use of hydrogen was very dangerous, and only added to the negative side of the project, ultimately contributing to its impracticality.
1118	15951	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was the structural stress; the dirigible's load and the wind pressure couldn't be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly a thousand feet below. Another thing that was an obstacle for the builders was the considerable cost, as over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to support the mast. Also, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof without considering these structural reinforcements. The last and perhaps most critical obstacle was safety. Most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This led to a major accident on May 6, 1937, after which the Empire State Building's owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it happened in downtown New York. These are some of the key obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately faced and could not fully overcome.
1119	15952	6	3	In the account of the mooring mast, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof without addressing the immense structural load. A thousand-foot dirigible would add significant stress to the building's frame, posing a serious risk. This means the steel frame would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to bear the additional weight and forces. Another major setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen for lift, and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a perpetual fire hazard. Nature itself was perhaps the greatest obstacle. The winds on top of the building were always shifting due to violent air currents around the skyscraper. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around uncontrollably. Lead weights were considered as an option to stabilize it, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was deemed not safe for the public below. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which was passed after the Hindenburg disaster. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, rendering the mooring mast obsolete.
1120	15953	6	3	There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle faced for their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable and safe landing area in such a densely populated urban environment. Another significant obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which presented an unacceptable risk to the city and its inhabitants. These were some of the different obstacles they faced which collectively caused the lack of success for the ambitious dirigible docking plan.
1121	15954	6	3	On December 11, 1929, a man named Al Smith announced he was building the world's tallest building at 1,250 feet. This building was the Empire State Building in New York, that would be used for a dirigible mooring. But, there would be a few obstacles to face, that would cause the dirigible mooring to not successfully be used. Al Smith announced he was building this mooring mast but did not announce potential obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building would face when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the largest obstacles would be the wind factor, causing the dirigible's back end to sway dangerously in the powerful gusts at that altitude. Another significant issue, would be having the foreign dirigibles full of flammable gases to be moored too close to a densely populated area, creating a substantial fire risk for the city below. Also, before any dirigibles could be moored, constructors had to spend extra time and money to make the building much more sturdy, to hold the immense weight and pull of the dirigibles. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved too great to overcome for the ambitious plan.
1122	15955	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof without considerable structural changes. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add tremendous stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, requiring extensive reinforcement. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to make the buildings framework capable of withstanding these forces. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the extreme height made it desirable to postpon to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes, rendering the mooring mast obsolete.
1123	15956	6	3	"When the architects first looked at creating a safe landing zone for the dirigibles they over looked several key factors. The Empire State building is over a thousand feet tall, at those heights the winds become very powerful and would blow the dirigible all over the place. This was proved in a practical test. The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skillful pilot he could not get the steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the Spire due to the turbulent conditions. Another factor the architects did not weigh in to the equation was that most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on Fire then that would be one massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York. The ""Hindenburg"" disaster gave us the example which was all we needed to see to change our mind about wanting a massive flammable balloon hovering over the streets of New York City, sealing the fate of the dirigible mooring concept."
1124	15957	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire over a densely populated area like New York, there could have been a huge accident with catastrophic loss of life. One of the greatest obstacles however was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds, making the operation nearly impossible. By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered unpractical and unsafe on multiple levels. Due to mother nature and safety reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there, leading to the eventual abandonment of the plan."
1125	15958	6	3	"In the provided text it said ""New York City was the lack of a suitable Landing space"" which presented a major initial challenge. Another obstacle was nature itself as the winds would push the dirigible around, causing the back of it to swing uncontrollably. The other obstacle was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which created a legal barrier to the operation. These are the primary problems that the Empire State builders faced, and together they formed an insurmountable barrier to the successful use of the building as a dirigible terminal."
1126	15959	6	3	"The builders and engineers involved in allowing The Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast around one thousand two hundred and fifty feet in the air faced many obstacles. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, taken from The Empire State Building, the reader is taken through the journey in allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the Empire State Building. This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous, creating significant structural stress. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very hard to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, However to blimps did attempt to land there. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both were unsuccessful in landing due to intense winds and sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project is an example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute, ultimately remaining a visionary but impractical concept."
1127	15960	6	3	Based on the excerpt, I dont think they should have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, I think this because something really bad could of happened and something probably has happend, such as a catastrophic fire or a crash endangering the densely populated streets below. But back then they really had no choice except for balloons, as airships were considered a leading technology for future air travel. The inherent dangers, however, ultimately outweighed the potential benefits of the venture, making the attempt a significant risk.
1128	15961	6	3	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author states nature is one of the biggest problems for the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The author explains that the wind on top of the buildings are dangerous for the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The author also describes what the dirigible would do as an affect of the wind. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This uncontrollable motion made a stable and safe docking procedure impossible to achieve. Those were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there, demonstrating how natural forces can thwart even the most ambitious engineering projects."
1129	15962	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself, which proved to be an insurmountable challenge despite all the planning and consultation.
1130	15963	6	3	"This project towards ""transportation of the future"" for the Empire State Building was no easy task. One of the major obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame"". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to accommodate the dirigibles. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked. Allowing these giant aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was ""neither practical nor safe."" These obstacles caused the workers and architects to postpone the build, and the concept was eventually abandoned as unfeasible."
1131	15964	6	3	One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps, a feature intended to help establish New York as a leader in modern travel. Yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the turbulent air currents around the skyscraper's peak. This would cause the dirigible to swing unpredictably around the mast, making a secure connection nearly impossible. The idea of weighting the back of the airship with lead was immediately ruled out because of the imminent danger such heavy, swinging objects would impose on the pedestrians on the street far below. Also, there was a specific law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for any dirigible to tie up or even approach the area in the first place. These combined challenges proved insurmountable for the ambitious plan.
1132	15965	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles at the top of their building, confronting issues of law, safety, and nature that ultimately thwarted this gutsy idea. They first faced the problem of legal restrictions, namely an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed a significant obstacle because it meant pilots would have to dock the blimp while technically violating a restricted flight zone. The second problem was dealing with public safety, a concern sharply highlighted when the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed. Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been over downtown New York. After blimps were proven to be highly flammable, the builders saw that an accident over the densely populated city would be far more catastrophic than one in a rural area. Finally, the builders faced problems with nature, as demonstrated when the dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the building's forceful and shifting winds. The builders realized that the drastic and unpredictable wind conditions at the top of the building were not appropriate for securing a blimp. These designers had more than a mundane idea, but it was ultimately shot down by the multiple obstacles that arose.
1133	15966	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in their plan for a dirigible mooring mast. A primary concern was structural integrity; as one analysis noted, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This statement highlights the fear that the stress of the massive, shifting airships could potentially compromise the building's structural stability, and they certainly did not want that stress to contribute to the building toppling over. Also, the natural environment presented a severe challenge, as the winds on the top of the building were consistently shifting due to the violent air currents surrounding the tall structure. This indicates they were worried that powerful and sudden gusts might wrench the balloon away from the building, causing it to crash and injure people on the ground. These are only a few of the critical obstacles the builders had to face, and together they rendered the plan unworkable.
1134	15967	6	3	The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hardest obstacles to overcome was ensuring safety for everyone involved. The builders had to worry about the safety of the people coming in and out of the dirigible itself, the pedestrians on the nearby streets, and the occupants within the building. Safety was one of the main reasons why the dirigible dock was never completed or put into regular use. Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was the force of nature. This is true because winds at the top of such tall buildings were always changing direction and strength, and this unpredictable turbulence would make it exceedingly hard to land and secure the large, lightweight dirigible on the mast. As one excerpt states, dirigibles were sometimes weighted down in the back by lead weights for stability, and this very solution would cause a new problem by endangering any pedestrians walking in the streets far below. The accumulation of these safety and natural issues ultimately doomed the project.
1135	15968	6	3	There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that mooring a massive airship would add significant stress to the building's frame. For example, one analysis points out that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame from both the weight and the constant pulling from wind forces. Another major obstacle was that the building's steel structure would have to be extensively modified to handle these new loads. As stated, the steel of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, requiring a costly and complex retrofit that may not have been structurally feasible. These are some of the primary structural obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, contributing to the idea's abandonment.
1136	15969	6	3	"The idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place. When these dirigibles would try to dock to this building, the structure of the building wouldn't be able to handle the violent winds and the zeppelin, leading to significant structural strain. It caused many problems. What if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew its tail end around to hit a building, causing catastrophic damage? The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this occurred in such a heavily populated place, it would be chaos, resulting in immense loss of life. Impractical and unsafe, this plan wouldn't work. They would need something more stable, like a ground-based facility. The plans of this weren't completely thought through, overlooking fundamental engineering and safety concerns. All these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear indefinitely. These plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen, ultimately being abandoned. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel, sealing the fate of the ambitious dirigible docking scheme."
1137	15970	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse, with falling debris and fire threatening the city below. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving for a safe docking procedure. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people, risking a break from its mooring. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there, rendering the mooring mast an architectural novelty.
1138	15971	6	3	"The idea of the dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was very smart and could've been great, offering a revolutionary urban transit hub. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when trying to achieve that goal. One problem was the wind forces were too strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (∂ @NUM1), making a stable connection nearly impossible. Another reason is the safety of the people. Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take into consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible or simply standing on the streets beneath it. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (∂ @NUM3). The docking at the Empire State Building was a great idea but there were too many challenges that faced the builders, from weather to law, ensuring the mast was never used as intended."
1139	15972	6	3	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, which was impressive for their time. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City, making them truly colossal machines. So the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, as their immense size required a vast, clear space. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building, the tallest structure in the world. He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, creating a terminal in the sky. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the ship and then tied it to a mast so by swinging the body the passengers could safely get on and off via a narrow gangplank. This visionary concept, however, ultimately proved to be unworkable in practice.
1140	15973	6	3	The problems that the workers had to face in letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building were crucial & @CAPS1. Because first if they would have tried to put a Mooring Mast on the top of the Building roof and then have a thousand pound dirigible on top of it, the holding force @CAPS2 would be too much for it to handle. And the stress of the dirigible's weight and wind pressure will need to be transmitted to the Building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The frame of the Building would have to be stronger, modified @CAPS3 for it to work, but it would be over @MONEY1 to put into the Building framework in order for it to succeed. But the most important reason why it was difficult for the workers is because of the winds. And if landed they would need weights to weigh it down but it would be dangling high above pedestrians which wasn't practical or safe, posing a constant danger to the city below. The structural and logistical hurdles thus proved too great to overcome.
1141	15974	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building many obstacles had occurred, particularly concerning the ambitious plan to dock dirigibles. During the process of planning the mooring mast of the building architects started to realize that there could be many complications. Several complications occurred during the process. Architects noticed that the building itself was not made to add additional parts and required significant structural changes. As an architect said ""it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Wind was another harsh factor for the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ""held by a single cable tether, it would add Stress to the buildings frame. The engineers will also muched with the building's issues."" the Steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened extensively to accommodate this new situation. Safety and nature also had a big play in the obstacles of the building of the Empire State Building. Architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up, but wanting to do this could be very dangerous. ""dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe. Building the dirigible would have caused many accidents, injuries, and deaths if made. Nature would also be inroled in this plan. ""open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If anyday had very fierce winds this object could have came down and caused serious danger, making the entire concept a significant risk."
1142	15975	6	3	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved and proved insurmountable. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the immense pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building, a costly and complex endeavor. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the powerful and unpredictable winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically, creating an uncontrollable hazard. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles collectively made the use of the Empire State Building as a dock unrealistic and ultimately an abandoned venture."
1143	15976	6	3	In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dringibles dock on the Empire State Building. At first Al Smith wanted this newly designed building to be the tallest one in the world, a goal that drove the entire project. Now this 1,250 foot building would reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing drigible to dock there. Passengers would get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refuling its engine, envisioning a futuristic travel hub. Although this was a great idea there were many issues that the constructor did not see, This is because the thousand foot dirigible would add significant stress to the buildings frame. The wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage, to ensure that no damage or harm would be put on the building or residents of New York the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened considerably. This cost the city of New York over @MONEY1 in the hopes of putting it on the map for modern travel, an investment that ultimately faced too many practical challenges to succeed.
1144	15977	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were lack of area, populated area, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" Hydrogen is very dangerous and it's flammable and Empire State Building is located in a populated area, so it's dangerous to risk a catastrophic event in such a dense urban environment. Also as German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it proved to the owners of Empire State Building that it's more dangerous than it looks, serving as a stark and tragic reminder of the risks involved. Other reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the top of the building was the existing law agains all airships flying too low over populated areas, a legal barrier that underscored the public safety concerns and ultimately contributed to the plan's failure."
1145	15978	6	3	"In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to come up with a safe plan which included building designs and figure out problems they failed to see from the begginning, a task that proved more difficult than anticipated. The first obstacle was meeting with the navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan for dirigible operations. They had to find a way to land the dirigibles without adding stress to the buildings frame and without spending @MONEY1 to strengthen it, a financial and engineering challenge. The builders came up with a plan that included what the mast would have to be made of and what wold be on each floor, detailing the necessary infrastructure. They even had to finish the roor before the mooring mast cold take place, adding to the construction timeline. The largest obstacle was one they failed to see from the beginning, a fundamental oversight. In building the mooring mast, they would have to face obstacles that nature brought, which was simply impossible to overcome fully. Safety was the main problem; if a fire occurred, there would be a disaster of immense proportions. The winds were too strong due to violent air currents and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low, creating legal and environmental barriers. After all this work, they couldn't get passed the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built, marking the end of this ambitious but impractical idea."
1146	15979	6	3	"the obstacles the builders faced was many of them. one of the things they faced was that they dident No if they wanted to build the tower in the first place, creating a fundamental uncertainty from the outset. And the other reason were ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather then helium. And hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk. And one of the greater obstacles was mooring mast was nature its self, with powerful winds and unpredictable weather conditions making the operation hazardous. These combined issues presented a formidable challenge to the project's feasibility from the very beginning."
1147	15980	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, builders of the Empire State building faced many problems. Their first problem was; ""[t]he architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of... the flat roof"". The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modifie and strengthen the steel frame of the empire state building to bear the additional load. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flamable making it highly dangerous for on two moor overapopulated New York city, as any accident could lead to catastrophe. Also nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were just so strong it'd be dangerous to moor there, creating unstable conditions for docking. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas presented a legal barrier that could not be overcome. The mooring mast atop of the Empire State building was a good idea but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely and against the law, ultimately dooming the ambitious concept to failure."
1148	15981	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they couldnot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, requiring significant structural reinforcement. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, a complex and costly engineering challenge. The second obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2), which would make docking maneuvers extremely perilous. Another obstacle they faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM3). This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the entire concept legally impractical from the start."
1149	15982	6	3	"The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the World and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased to support the structure. They made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of New York with the risk of a catastrophic fire. Also, according to the aricle, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated, presenting an insurmountable natural challenge."
1150	15983	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to anchor at the top of the building. A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether adds stress to the buildings frame, the architects needed to find a way to transmit the stress of the wind pressure and dirigibles load to the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation, a difficult structural engineering problem. Safety had played a major role in the fate of the mooring mast. Outside the United States most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a substantial hazard. If a dirigible was to catch fire above a densely populated area there would be disaster, a risk that was deemed too great. The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature. Above the Empire State Building the wind was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the shape would still be unstable to land, making the entire operation dangerously unpredictable and ultimately impractical."
1151	15984	6	3	"In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon Lusted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author told the readers that after building the Empire State Building, the builders had to reconstruct the entire building, having to make it stronger to support the top. This was a significant undertaking, as ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers of the building also had to be working at a dangerous height of 1,250 feet, which presented its own set of challenges. They not only had to rebuild the foundation and strength of the building, but also the very top. ""Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again - this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast."" These are just some of the many hardships the workers had to face, demonstrating the immense effort required for this ambitious project."
1152	15985	6	3	"Obstacles the builders had to face with the Empire State Building was that they did not have the enough technology to land a dirigible on the mooring mast. In February 1931, @CAPS1 Clavan of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a heigh made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" This statement highlighted the technical difficulties that proved insurmountable at the time. After @CAPS1 Clavan said that, the using of the dirigibles had disappeared as a practical form of transit. By the late 1930s, the dirigibles had been given away to airplanes, which were becoming a more reliable mode of air travel. Also, the builders had to construct an electric winch and a gang plank; the electric winch is hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast, and the gang plank led to an open observation platform, but these features were ultimately never used for their intended purpose."
1153	15986	6	3	"It was once said ""where there is a will there is a way"". However, they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance, there was a will and a way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building, but the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen, which was a safer but less buoyant gas. Also, the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than at regular life level, creating a hazardous environment for a large, slow-moving aircraft. Another major issue was the un-ideal place they were trying to use, situated in the heart of a dense and windy urban canyon. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1,"" which emphasized the importance of foresight and planning that was somewhat lacking in this daring venture."
1154	15987	6	3	"At sporting events, people have gotten used to seeing the @CAPS1 blimp or the Goodyear blimp. Now they are used for advertising, but not many people know that they were once thought of as transportation. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, shows not only the original purpose for the mast of the Empire State Building was for mooring blimps, but also shows the many problems faced with blimp travel. Safety was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind, and it could be dangerous for both the aircraft and the building. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas, and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law; furthermore, flying that low would risk wind pushing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it. Al Smith had a good idea for the Empire State Building's mast; however, there were too many problems to make it a reality."
1155	15988	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off, creating a revolutionary downtown air terminal. But with this came lots of work, and they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make detailed plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast and integrate it with the structure below. In the story it says ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows."" This careful, phased construction was essential to realizing the ambitious, though ultimately impractical, vision."
1156	15989	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. An issue they faced was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether; this added stress to the building's frame. The stress of the blimp's load, plus the considerable wind pressure, would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be significantly strengthened to accommodate this immense force, a complex and costly engineering challenge that was fundamental to the mooring mast's feasibility."
1157	15990	6	3	They had to build the tower just right or else there would be landing problems if they added the sightseeing attraction. People would pay any price for such a novel experience, but the price of keeping it stable was not worth the immense effort required. In the end, the people were likely going to make this a very popular thing, but it was not up to them if it was or was not popular, as practical realities intervened. Wind and landing difficulties always stood in their way, so they paid a lot of money to re-stabilize the building. This ended up being a profitable venture and a ride of a lifetime for the sightseers who eventually visited the observation deck, even if the original airship plan was abandoned.
1158	15991	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles the builders faced to have the dirigibles be able to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle the builders faced was figuring out how to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring mast on top of the building. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a lot of money back in the 1930's. Once the builders finished framing the entire building, the greatest obstacle to constructing the mooring mast came to be. This obstacle was nature itself, as violent air currents at that altitude would have the back of the blimps swivel around and around the mast. The blimp would need heavy weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street and this was neither practical nor safe, presenting an insurmountable hazard.
1159	15992	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were said to be hailed as the transportation of the future; however, in New York City, there was a lack of a suitable landing area. The speed at which dirigibles traveled and the area, along with the heights and unpredictable wind speed, became unquestionable problems. The dirigible plan became more and more unreasonable, especially with a significant accident occurring in New Jersey. When considering the height, wind, speed, and location, using dirigibles was no longer a good or safe idea, leading to the abandonment of the concept.
1160	15993	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was having to try and make it perfect, especially for the designers. They went through a lot of work, effort, and time attempting to realize this ambitious vision. They tried to make different arrangements for the government people involved in the project. The dirigibles were always envisioned near the mooring mast, yet they were afraid that the massive airship would knock over one day due to the high winds. They also wanted them to become the transportation of the future, a rival to the emerging airplanes. In the end, the transportation role was ceded to the airplanes, and the dirigible mast became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. So, their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay for the building's ultimate purpose and legacy."
1161	15994	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to figure a way around the initial challenges. The architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building with this vision. Soon enough, fundamental problems evolved that could not be fixed by simple engineering. An example of one of their most critical problems is that dirigibles of the era primarily used hydrogen, which is far more flammable than the safer alternative, helium. If the dirigible had an accident over New York, such as catching fire, many people on the ground would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the unpredictable and powerful wind currents at such a high altitude. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around dangerously even if it was tied up to the mast. However, they could theoretically use heavy lead weights to keep it still, but if they fell from that height, they would undoubtedly hurt some pedestrians walking by on the streets below. Furthermore, the existing state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low over the city, which made it practically impossible for dirigibles to be legally tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these insurmountable problems were considered, the architects never added the functional landing gear to the mooring mast because they ultimately knew that it would not be used as it was originally intended to be.
1162	15995	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One example of an obstacle that the builders had to face was how to structurally attach the massive mooring mast on top of the building in a secure manner. In paragraph nine it says, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" They had to come up with a safe and integrated way to attach it to the building's core. Another example of a major obstacle was that they had to significantly strengthen and modified the entire building's frame because in paragraph nine it stated that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame."" The last example was in paragraph nine when they explained that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The Stress might be so much for the building that it could potentially cause the building to collapse under the strain. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders faced many complex obstacles as to allowing dirigibles to dock safely on the Empire State Building in New York City."
1163	15996	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders of the empire state building would have faced many consequences in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A regular sized dirigible of the time was an impressive craft, made of ""enormous steel framed ballons."" They were capable of impressive speeds, going as fast as ""eighty miles per hour, and could cruise at seventy per hour."" The Empire State Building's location, however, presented a grave danger, as the idea of a ""building dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" for the public below. And even if the dirigible managed to land there successfully, the massive ship would ""swivel around and around"" in the high winds, which would have made the entire building structure more move-able and unstable. Even if the ship would land there, a fundamental legal barrier existed, as it was ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even approach the area"" at the required low altitude over the city. These combined issues made the ambitious plan ultimately unworkable from the start."
1164	15997	6	3	"Other than making amendments to the initial building plans, the builders of the empire state building faced profound obstacles in the areas of safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing as an extreme safety hazard, especially ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" where a single spark could lead to catastrophe. Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the extreme altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and inherently dangerous, to weigh down and stabilize docking dirigibles against the powerful gusts. Lastly, the ambitious building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing aviation laws of the time. Laws clearly forbade airships from traveling at the low altitudes necessary over urban areas; therefore the intended use of the mooring mast would be outright illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire state building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles and ultimately concede to their impracticality."
1165	15998	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Originally, one of the greatest problems builders faced was structurally strengthening the building's foundational base in order to support the immense stress of the dirigibles load and the constant wind pressure. To combat this, a great deal of costly modifications had to made to the building's underlying framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications associated with the mooring mast were not fully considered until after it was already built. A most important one was public safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles relied on hydrogen to float, which is highly flammable and dangerous. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster occurring over New York City was considered too dangerous a risk to take. Another preventer of the mast's use were the fierce winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing direction due to the violent air currents at that elevation. The swaying dirigible could not be securely anchored with hanging weights due to the obvious danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge final complication of making the dream a reality was an existing law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This regulation would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that faced the builders of the Empire State building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, eventually led to the complete dropping of the idea all together.
1166	15999	6	3	The empire state builders faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been above a densely populated area such as down town New York. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making stable approach and docking a formidable challenge. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, preventing a secure connection. Another obstical the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire impractical idea was dropped permanently.
1167	16000	6	3	"It is stated in the article that ""[t]he mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose,"" and that proves to be true. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in trying to have dirigibles dock at the building. For example, one obstacle that is faced is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is an extremely flammable gas, and if a dirigible is destroyed by fire like the Hindenburg it could cause a terrible accident in a heavily populated area like New York. Therefore the builders face an obstacle of a safety issue with the dirigibles if one catches on fire in New York. Another important obstacle is that strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building causes the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, which causes the dirigibles to not get close enough to the mooring mass. Also the wind creates a risk that a dirigible could be blown onto a sharp spire of another building, ""and the dirigible could be punctured which causes a dangerous situation for the captain. To weigh down the dirigible so that it does not swivel as much in the wind, the controllers would have to use lead weights. Though the lead weights lessen the swiveling it is not practical or safe because lead weights would be hanging above pedestrians on the street, and if a lead weight fell it could be fatal. Lastly, if the dirigible to moor at the Empire State Building it would be breaking an existing law. This law states that airships can not fly to low over urban areas, so it is clear that it is illegal to moor on the Empire State Building. Before this project was started the builders should have researched or accounted for all the obstacles they were going to face, but their oversight led to the mast's ultimate failure."
1168	16001	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. One major problem arose when they realized the force of holding the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. @NUM1). This meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device, a costly and complex undertaking. Once the mast and reconstruction work completed, builders realize that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. @NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. Attempts to moor became even moor difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. @NUM3). This shows how builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast, facing delays and a lack of proper planning. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project caused builders to struggle with the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, before ultimately abandoning the mast as an unworkable concept."
1169	16002	6	3	The obstacles the buliders had to go through was preety hard. It was hard because the building was so high up in the air, presenting significant dangers. They needed special gear to do it, and safety was a constant concern. Al Smith had to wait for an answer before building the mast because it was dangerous and required official approval. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building framwork to reinforce it for the mast's immense stress. The other obsticals were to drop and let passengers on, a maneuver that proved too complex. Also to refull your dirigibles if you had one, which was another service they had envisioned. And it was just to make the building bigger and more famous, but the practical challenges were ultimately too great to overcome.
1170	16003	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock. The first was that they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building, it would have put too much stress on the buildings frame. They had to transmite the stress all the way down to the foundation of the building, requiring extensive structural modifications. They did over @MONEY1 worth of framework to the building to achieve this. Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which was impossible. First off the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent ever-changing winds were too much to control the ship in, making a steady approach hazardous. But even if they did dock the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast, preventing any safe passenger transfer. Another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas. So now the ships couldn't ever approach the building to tie off to the mast, rendering the entire expensive project futile from a legal standpoint.
1171	16004	6	3	"Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not considered in the beginning, the builders of the Empire State building faced these obstacles eventually. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, New Jersey because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a large problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" when a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it hard to hold the dirigible steady, it made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangling weights above the city ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimps (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the Goodyear blimp from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation, rendering the ambitious concept ultimately impractical."
1172	16005	6	3	In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety, most dirigibles who were coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. This created a significant fire hazard, especially over a crowded city. Another obstacle was just nature itself. Winds were constantly shifting caused by violent air currents at the building's summit, making it nearly impossible to secure an airship. Another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the practice the mast was designed for. The builders should have realized all the hazards they were facing, and just dropped the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers, as the risks far outweighed the potential benefits.
1173	16006	6	3	In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands 1,250 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak. The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at such a height is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put over sixty thousand dollars of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building. An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with hydrogen in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives. I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time, but the practical dangers were too severe. They should still use the mooring mast today, but only if the significant safety concerns could be adequately addressed.
1174	16007	6	3	Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mast due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flammable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obstacles in their way the owners and builders of the Empire state building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear indefinitely.
1175	16008	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders went through many obstacles to get their mooring mast done. The builders thought they had everything all set and under control. When they had made their plans they had planned for the mast to be a big piece of the building's identity. When they had made the mast it just wasn't right for its intended purpose. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Then they had more problems because a law was being passed that the ships could not tie themselves to the buildings; they wouldn't have anyone visit the building via airship. But they solved that problem by having airplanes bring the passengers to a nearby airport instead. Even though the builders went through many obstacles they still managed to get passed them by adapting their plans and finding alternative uses for the building's iconic status."
1176	16009	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the reader learns about the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most important obstacle to overcome was safety, primarily concerning the volatile gas used for lift. The United States used hydrogen rather than helium to power the dirigibles, a substance known for its high flammability. As said in @CAPS2 @NUM1, after the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fiery accident, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic the accident would be if it was over a densely populated area such as New York. Another significant obstacle faced was the brutal winds which occur at such a high altitude, making stable docking nearly impossible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM2). The final obstacle the builders faced was a legal one, specifically that there was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) which made it illegal to tie a dirigible to a building. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles yet in the end, the venture proved unfeasible as ""Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes"" (@CAPS2 @NUM4)."
1177	16010	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One clear obstacle was the law that had existed at the time making it against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas, effectively prohibiting the docking procedure (paragraph @NUM1). Also, another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a grave safety risk. For example on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been it had taken place in downtown New York, a densely populated metropolis (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle was nature itself, manifesting as unpredictable and powerful weather conditions. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, creating an unstable and dangerous situation (paragraph @NUM3). Ultimately, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were too much to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast successfully.
1178	16011	6	3	"Throughout the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced were difficult and multifaceted, primarily falling under the challenge of being able to let dirigibles dock there safely. Some difficulties they faced were that outside from the states, more dirigibles were being made, but with ""hydrogen rather than helium"". they stated, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". There was fear for the people on the ground, since New York was so densely populated, amplifying the potential for disaster. There were also severe weather problems to contend with. Winds at that altitude were constantly shifting, making controlled docking a hazardous endeavor. If a ship were moored, the ""ship would swivel around and around"" uncontrollably. Realizing the immense danger and the combination of these insurmountable problems, all they could do in the end was shut the ambitious project down."
1179	16012	6	3	"In the construction of the Empire State building the @CAPS1 faced plenty of problems before and after the making of the mast, which prevented the successful docking of dirigibles. There were laws preventing the docking of the dirigibles, incidents that had occurred, and inherent flaws in the safety plan. The first problem they should have turned their attention to was the existing law against low-flying aircraft over urban areas. It is said that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the area."" Another significant problem faced was the tragic burning of the Hindenburg. The U.S. used helium to keep their dirigibles afloat while other countries were using highly-flammable hydrogen. This posed a big threat and @CAPS1 even started to wonder ""how much worse that incident would be if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York."" The final problem was how un-safe it was to have a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building; the cargo and the ship itself would send the dirigible out of control in these winds. The mast on the Empire State Building had too many problems for the @CAPS1 to solve, and thus the concept would never make it from the start."
1180	16013	6	3	"To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the @CAPS1 had many obstacles to face, both structural and environmental. Some of the obstacles were that a mooring mast could not be simply dropped and a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top, as the immense force ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof without considering these engineering challenges. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself, with high-altitude winds creating a volatile and unpredictable environment for any airship attempting to dock. The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building had significant obstacles to face, which ultimately prevented the realization of their ambitious vision for a downtown dirigible port."
1181	16014	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders had faced many obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. They had faced many challenges, particularly concerning the structural and operational aspects of the mooring mast. One of the main concerns were safety, as the process of attaching the massive airships to the skyscraper was inherently risky. Al Smith had commented, saying ""They were trying to figure some safe way of mooring airships to this mast,"" highlighting the primary technical dilemma among any other safety issues. Ultimately, the fundamental dangers proved too difficult to overcome, leading to the concept's abandonment."
1182	16015	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were harsh and ultimately insurmountable. The builders, in theory, thought everything would work perfectly, envisioning a futuristic transit hub in the sky. They had to face that they did not do enough to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there, such as the volatile nature of the gases used for lift. As I read I noticed the building never fulfilled it's purpose. This was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, a fear tragically confirmed by the Hindenburg disaster. So in reality this idea was not safe and the builders had to go through building it, having it all done, then realizing the idea was not pursuable, rendering the mast a monumental folly.
1183	16016	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were so determined to make sure everything would work out fine with their ambitious plan for a dirigible mooring mast. They invested significant effort and resources into the design and construction of the mast atop the towering structure. However, despite their determination and initial optimism, the building just wasn't meant for dirigibles to dock there due to a combination of practical and safety concerns that became apparent only after its completion. The concept, while visionary, was fundamentally flawed for the urban environment, and the mast never served its intended purpose.
1184	16017	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing, a catastrophic risk for a densely populated city. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York, making the peril undeniable. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field, requiring near-impossible precision. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored until the dangers became clear. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible, ending the short-lived dream of a skyscraper air terminal."
1185	16018	6	3	"Based on the information I just read, the obstacles the builders had of the empire building, was to find a way to allow the dirigibles to dock there. There are rooms that have been never opened to public and is the highest observation deck, which were originally intended for passenger processing. They had to make room for a dock but they didnt know how to do so safely and effectively. One major obstacle the builders faced was the city didnt want ""dirigibles to moor at the empire state building because the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. They also had complications as the captain of the dirigibles shell could not let go of the control levers during the delicate docking maneuver. Furthermore, the sharp spires of other buildings could pop the dirigibles, posing a constant threat during approach. The wind was also a problem as it could take the dirigibles a different direction, making a stable connection to the mast nearly impossible. Together, these challenges proved that the visionary plan was not viable in practice."
1186	16019	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include: hydrogen gas being highly flammable, high winds and wind shifts at the top of the building, and laws that airships could not fly too low over cities such as New York City. The problem of hydrogen gas came to them when a blimp blew up in New Jersey, then the owners realized how bad it could've been in the city, highlighting the severe fire risk over a densely populated area. When it comes to high winds the excerpt says, ""... if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" due to the unpredictable and violent air currents at such a great height. Also, the law mentioned would have made it illegal for blimps to come close to the Empire State Building, creating a legal barrier to the docking plan. These combined challenges of safety, nature, and regulation ultimately proved too difficult to overcome for the building's innovative but impractical dirigible docking concept."
1187	16020	6	3	"The builders had many troubles with the building of the Empire State building. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This is one trouble they had because if the dirigibles ever was an acident abuve New York City it would be bad because New York is so poluted, leading to a potential catastrophe. Another problem was"",they could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the empire State building's Flat roof."" This was a big problem because now they had to fix their desing to properly integrate the mast into the structure. lastly another problem was the compotition, ""Al Smith relized that he was close to loosing the title of the worlds talest building. Al Smith was so caught up in his desing he did not relize the compotition. So when he found out he knew had to make his taller, which added further pressure and complexity to the entire construction project. These issues collectively complicated the ambitious goals for the skyscraper."
1188	16021	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, requiring significant structural redesign. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. Most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases. When the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangerous that could be over a populated area. These are just some of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, illustrating the immense practical difficulties of the plan.
1189	16022	6	3	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are making sure they don't bump into other buildings, and they use rope to drop down the papers. They are trying to make sure that the dirigibles do not pop if it touches the buildings, which was a major concern for the fragile airships. It is also trying to keep the dirigibles away so they don't get too close and that's why they are dropping the papers down with ropes, as a proposed method for transferring mail and passengers without a physical docking. If they built a little tunnel so the dirigibles can go in they won't have to worry about them getting popped if they touch a building, but this idea was ultimately not feasible. These simplistic solutions highlight the fundamental challenges of integrating large airships with a skyscraper in a dense urban environment.
1190	16023	6	3	"In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the greatest obstacles was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An accident where the German dirigible caught fire and was destroyed, shocked the builders, but they realized it could have been worse if it had occurred over Manhattan. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would ""swivel"" around even if it was tethered, posing a significant control issue. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal hurdle. All of these examples would cause the builders to face obstacles that ultimately prevented the dirigible docking concept from becoming a practical reality."
1191	16024	6	3	"Many significant problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, @CAPS1 particularly in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, the construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was inherently dangerous. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things required to dock at the building. For example, ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This fundamental mooring was impossible primarily because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This regulation made it explicitly illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this meteorological challenge and the fact that construction for such a high-altitude docking operation at the time was ultimately impracticable, dirigibles never successfully touched the Empire State building. So to close, the combined difficulty of building the dirigible landing gear and of safely landing the dirigibles themselves ultimately ended the practical use of the Empire State Building docks."
1192	16025	6	3	"In their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders came up against significant structural, safety, and practicality obstacles. In order to have the mast on top of the building, the builders had to substantially strengthen the steel framework, an effort that required ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" Also, they had grave safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a densely populated city, on a skyscraper. One of these primary concerns was the use of the flammable gas hydrogen that was commonly used in non-American dirigibles. If such a dirigible caught fire over the city the catastrophic effects would be devastating. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was completely at the will of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it danger to citizens"" below. The mast was also fundamentally impractical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. And finally, in later years dirigibles had ""given way to airplanes,"" thus making the mooring mast for dirigibles entirely useless. The builders of the Empire State Building never succeeded in their attempt of putting an active mooring mast on top of the building, because of the insurmountable structural, safety, and practicality obstacles that they stumbled upon."
1193	16026	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they came across many significant issues. One major problem was the immense stress on the building's structure from the added mast. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all they way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" @CAPS1 This illustrates how the considerable stress factors on the building troubled its construction and stability. Another formidable obstacle to its construction was the unpredictable weather, as ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". When building the dock, constructors ran into these persistent issues which eventually overcame them and led to its overall uselessness for its intended purpose."
1194	16027	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few critical problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be accomplished. When they decided to construct a ""rocket-shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first to support it. After the building of the mast was completed, saftey became a paramount issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at severe risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with heavy weights like they can in an open field. This would also be profoundly unsafe for the people of New York on the streets below. The main obstacle the builders faced involved these serious issues of saftey, which is a big issue in an urban environment. Therefore, due to these dangers, the dirigibles could not practically dock on the Empire State Building."
1195	16028	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced one giant obstacle. They faced the immense risk of blowing up the building itself. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This is one example from the excerpt that could turn into the biggest obstacle for the entire project. If one of these hydrogen-filled airships were to explode above this building then the building would likely suffer catastrophic damage. Also a lot of people would die from it too, creating a public safety disaster. That is one of the biggest and most dangerous obstacles they faced in their ambitious plan."
1196	16029	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles, including a weakened framework, nature and weather, potential fire hazards, and U.S. laws. Because the building was not originally designed to hold down dirigibles, the frame was not sturdy enough to survive the pulling and moving of the blimp in the air. The dirigibles would also be vacillating in the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which was 102 storeys, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Aside from pulling loose or damaging the building itself, the dirigibles were in danger of being punctured by another building's spire. Damage to the dirigible in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area in New York City around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and blowup, such as the case with the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians or other structures could be seriously damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also probable because of the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws forbid airships to come that close to urban areas like New York City. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it. In conclusion, many significant and ultimately insurmountable issues surfaced for the builders as they attempted to transform the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles.
1197	16030	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary goal was to create a terminal where airships could moor at the mast, so people could get off and unload or load up their ship. However, the building's structural frame was not originally designed to handle the immense stresses imposed by a large, tethered airship. Furthermore, the unpredictable and powerful wind currents at such a great height posed a severe risk to the stability of both the dirigible and the building itself. The use of highly flammable hydrogen gas in many dirigibles presented a catastrophic fire hazard in the densely populated urban area. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved too great, rendering the ambitious docking plan impractical and unsafe for the city and its inhabitants.
1198	16031	6	3	The problems the builders faced with allowing dirigibles to dock there was a lack of suitable land area and the mooring mast could not be simply dropped on the Empire State Building's flat roof. On top of that, a dirigible a thousand feet up held by a cable tether would add a lot of stress to the building's frame; the stress of the dirigible load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, which was not engineered for such dynamic forces. And the other reason was a safety reason: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The potential for a disastrous fire in the heart of a major city made the entire proposition exceptionally risky. These fundamental issues of structural integrity and public safety were the primary obstacles that prevented the realization of the dirigible docking station.
1199	16032	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the beginning, builders were faced with obstacles of very high expectations, including the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: being ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as said by John Tauranac. With the desire to now be a dock for what was known at the time as the ""transportation of the future"", came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles, which was a complex logistical challenge at such a height. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents at the summit. This problem, normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated New York City. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas, which legally prohibited the very operation they had envisioned."
1200	16033	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the lack of land area, the currents of the wind, and the gas used to make dirigibles float. The lack of land area was a problem because ""...some [dirigibles] were as long as 804 ft., the same length as four blocks in New York City."" This could be a problem because in a densely populated area like New York, people could be in danger of having large objects flying to and fro, so close to the ground. It would also obscure light and create massive shadows over the city streets. The wind currents were a factor because 102 floors above the ground, the wind would buffet large dirigibles around, which would be a danger to the building's frame. ""...the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation,"" placing an unforeseen strain on the entire structure. The final obstacle would be the gas used in many foreign dirigibles of the time, which was hydrogen, a highly flammable and dangerous gas to have in densely populated areas like New York City. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, [they] realized how much worse the accident could have been in New York,"" highlighting the immense risk involved. These three critical issues collectively made the plan to dock dirigibles at the skyscraper an unfeasible endeavor."
1201	16034	6	3	"There were many obstacles that got in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Most of these had to do with the framework of the building and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be ""modified and strengthened,"" or else there was no way the building would stay standing, requiring significant and costly structural reinforcements. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making a stable connection nearly impossible. Not only was it unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly too low over populated areas due to existing aviation regulations. After the construction of the mooring mast, it was soon realized that it would never be used, rendering the ambitious feature entirely impractical."
1202	16035	6	3	In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacles the builders faced were, hydrogen being highly flammable. The second main reason was winds from nature itself. The last reason was the law against airships. The first main obstacle the builders were faced with was there was hydrogen and helium in the balloon and the hydrogen was highly flammable, so the builders needed to make a safe place for the dirigibles to dock, a challenge that proved insurmountable given the volatile nature of the gas. The second main obstacle the builders were faced with was nature itself. The winds from on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a highly unstable environment for any large, lighter-than-air craft. The last obstacle the builders were faced with was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to ever tie up or approach a building in that area, creating a legal barrier to the plan's execution. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but in the end dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes, and the mast served only as a testament to a vision that was never realized.
1203	16036	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame. To do that they would need a lot of money like sixty thousand dollars for the necessary structural modifications. Another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant fire hazard in a densely populated urban center. But the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which would have made any attempted mooring a perilous and unpredictable maneuver, ultimately dooming the project to failure.
1204	16037	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One is that in the story it says that dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it got a hole in it then it would catch on fire, creating a catastrophic risk for the building and the city below. Another problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it impossible to securely hold a massive airship in place. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the very operation the builders had envisioned. Those are some obstacles the builders faced, a combination of technical, natural, and legal challenges that proved impossible to overcome.
1205	16038	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, representing a grave safety concern. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, unable to remain stationary in the windy conditions. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe, posing an unacceptable danger to the public. Those are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, illustrating why the grand plan was ultimately abandoned.
1206	16039	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles they had to face were the winds at the top of the building because the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This made it extremely difficult to secure an airship safely. It also wasn't safe having the dirigibles weighed down with lead weights so it wouldn't swivel around the mooring mast, as a sudden gust could send the massive craft swinging dangerously. Also, sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to handle the immense stress of a docked dirigible. They were scared that weighing the ship down with lead weights would be dangerous because of all the people below in the city, fearing a catastrophic accident. It must have been very hard to construct the mooring mast under such challenging and unpredictable conditions.
1207	16040	6	3	The Mooring Mast On December 11, 1929, Al Smith released to the public that the Empire State Building would reach a towering 1,250 feet, the world's tallest building. To do this they were going to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to dock dirigibles. The builders were unaware of the obstacles to come. They were faced with many architectural, financial, and nature based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized they could not just place the mast on top. The wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the dirigible being held by one cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down to the foundation. To do this it would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the frame work strong enough to hold the stress. Another obstacle that came into play was safety. In Europe hydrogen is used to fuel the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable so if anything ever happened over downtown New York, it would be a catastrophe. The greatest obstacle was said to be nature itself. The violent air currents are unpredictible and the dirigible would be shifting around even if weighted down. But it is not practical or safe to weigh the balloon down with pedestrians below. Overall the outcome of the mast was a fail due to the blindly seen and the blindly predicted obstacles of nature, architecture and finance.
1208	16041	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading they talk about how there is not much landing area in New York City but, although adding space for landing, the height of the mast would be dangerous, not only for passengers but for those who were on ground level. Also, the thousand plus pound craft would add stress to the building's frame; so the frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigible. This modification would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The idea proved to be unsafe when the German dirigible blew up at a mooring mast—they realized how dangerous that could be above a densely populated area like New York City. The combination of structural challenges and profound safety risks ultimately made the concept unworkable.
1209	16042	6	3	Based on the excerpt to The Mooring Mast, the builders who constructed the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. One of many obstacles was nature itself. The winds that are on top of the building were always shifting, because of the violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making a stable and secure docking procedure nearly impossible. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible, posing a significant fire hazard over the city. As you can see there are quite a few of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on this building, which ultimately led to the concept's failure.
1210	16043	6	3	"Based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the reasons for the idea's failure was the fact that there was already a law in place making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the area, creating an immediate legal barrier. Also, it could've been an extreme fire hazard if a blimp had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proved where it states, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" which caused the owners to realize, ""how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" On top of all this, weather proposed an even bigger problem. Violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe."" I believe the most important reason that the idea failed was because technology was simply advancing beyond predictions, as it says, ""Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" This shift in transportation technology rendered the entire mooring mast concept obsolete."
1211	16044	6	3	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon L¸sted discusses several adversities and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their many obstacles they faced, was ""the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was niether practical nor safe."" However before thinking of landing dirigibles, architects had to figure out a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof."" The structural integrity was a primary concern, as ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Most of the problems were avoidable, except for that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This fundamental and unpredictable environmental challenge ultimately proved to be one of the most difficult to overcome, contributing significantly to the project's impracticality."
1212	16045	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that most diribles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey. It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the pedestrians below. As stated, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless of lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped, ending a bold but ultimately impractical vision."
1213	16046	6	3	Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety and the realization that the risks far outweighed the potential benefits.
1214	16047	6	3	"The obstacles that the builder faced is making sure that the building was stable enough. The architects knew that they could not just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said that the mooring mask was on a okay level and how they were working on things. A set of engineers are working finding a workable and faster arrangements. While, the government is trying to find out a safe way for the mooring airships to mast. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The obstacles that the builders went through was if a big dirigible was to go on top of the building it was add stress by weighing it down. Also, it would get to the point where it would reach the frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building the winds cause violent shifting out to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good. The builder of the Empire State building faced many significant challenges to allow the dirigibles to dock there, and these structural and safety concerns were central to the project's failure."
1215	16048	6	3	"The Empire State Building was always very famous and well-known, but did want more attention. Governor of New York, Al Smith, tried to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. He was encouraged it would work and actually went through with building it. The builders went through many obstacles trying to make it possible.To make this dream possible the builders would have to modify and strengthen the building. This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top. Unfortunately, nobody considered all the dangers of docking dirigibles. All the builders work never went through. They tried to dock two but it did not work out. The building turned into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers, repurposing the ambitious structure for a safer and more public use."
1216	16049	6	3	When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects experienced many obstacles, which ultimately led the designers to never effectively use the structure as they had initially hoped. The first significant problem they encountered was the immense weight and force a thousand-ton dirigible would exert, adding considerable stress to the building's frame. To address this, the designers had to spend a substantial sum, over @MONEY1, to reinforce the building's frameworks with additional steel. This initial financial and engineering hurdle already cast doubt in the builders' minds, signaling that the project would not proceed easily. The next major realization was the extreme flammability of hydrogen-filled dirigibles. A catastrophic fire causing a huge airship to fall onto the densely populated streets of New York City was a terrifying prospect, which considerably lessened their enthusiasm for the venture. Furthermore, the wind conditions atop the building were constantly shifting due to unpredictable air currents, which would violently toss and turn any dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers recognized this would be neither practical nor safe, especially considering the pedestrians on the ground below. The final and perhaps most definitive obstacle was a pre-existing law governing airship travel, which stated that dirigibles could not fly that low over urban areas, effectively putting an illegal mark on their ambitious plans. Faced with this combination of structural, safety, environmental, and legal challenges, the designers of the mooring mast had to abandon their vision, and it was these very obstacles that led to the mast never being used for its intended purpose.
1217	16050	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the architects never fully realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles. One of these primary obstacles they faced was the sheer height of the mast, and the significant lack of safety that arose from it. In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which used highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen. Should a similar disaster have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the burning airship would plummet to the ground where many New Yorkers would be going about their day, resulting in a tragic loss of life. The largest obstacle they faced, however, was the uncontrollable force of nature. Powerful air currents and sudden storms would cause the dirigible, only tethered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor safe for the people below. The third major obstacle was a pre-existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urbanized areas. Even with the exceptional height of the Empire State Building, it was still impossible to legally dock an airship at the new mooring mast without violating this regulation. Consequently, Al Smith's ambitious idea for a skyscraper air terminal finally had to be abandoned due to the insurmountable issues of public safety, unpredictable nature, and restrictive state law."
1218	16051	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One initial obstacle was the combined weight of the dirigible, or blimp, and the immense force of wind pressure, which caused too much stress on the building's frame. Fortunately for the architects, this particular challenge was easily overcome. They strengthened the iron frame of the building with additional supports so it could withstand the added stress from a docked airship. Unfortunately, the other obstacles that emerged were not so easily solved, and they ultimately led to the complete abandonment of using the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem was undoubtedly safety. Many blimps of the era used highly flammable hydrogen rather than safer helium to stay afloat. There was simply too much of a risk of a blimp catching fire and plummeting onto the crowded city streets below. Nature was also an enormous and unpredictable obstacle. Strong winds would easily blow the buoyant blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, conventional weights could not effectively keep it stable and secure. Finally, there was an existing aviation law stating that aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas, which legally prohibited the docking procedure from ever taking place. These combined factors ensured the mooring mast would remain an unused architectural feature.
1219	16052	6	3	The problems that were faced with the dirigible docking plan were primarily related to safety and control. A significant issue was that the large, lightweight airships could easily get blown by strong winds and collide with nearby buildings. To counter this, designers considered the idea of putting heavy weights on the ship to stabilize it and prevent it from swinging. However, this proposed solution introduced a new danger, as the heavy weights themselves could potentially come loose and fall off, plummeting down to hit the unsuspecting people on the ground below. This created a cycle of problems where one potential solution only led to another serious hazard, highlighting the fundamental impracticality and danger of the entire docking concept.
1220	16053	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many obstacles were described that got in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building. One initial obstacle was structural; the Empire State Building had a flat roof and the framework of the building would have to be made significantly stronger to support the installation of the mooring mast. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof without these modifications, and it cost more than @MONEY1 to reinforce the underlying framework. Another formidable obstacle was the law. The regulation against ""flying too low over urban areas"" made it illegal, so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even approach the Empire State Building at the required altitude for docking. Lastly, and most critically, the biggest obstacle was public safety. The blimps being flown around New York at the time were often made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed a grave fire risk. Also, as noted, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It would not be safe to hook a blimp up in those turbulent winds where it would be shifting and swinging all around. Of course, this was also a direct safety hazard for the thousands of pedestrians on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street;"" it would be terrible if one fell. Given these overwhelming structural, legal, and safety concerns, it should have been obvious that the ambitious plan for hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was ultimately not going to work."
1221	16054	6	3	"On the excerpt there were a lot of obstacles on the atempt of Building the Empire State Building and making it safe to dock dirigibles. The first obstacle to building the Empire State building was that the engeier Al Smith wanted to make the Empire State building, ""the world's tallest building."" ""When the Empire State building was conceived, it was planed as the world's tallest building, taller even then the new Chrysler building that was being constructed."" The proble was that the architector of the Chrysler Building put a 185 ft spire inside the building, a secret maneuver that secured its temporary status as the tallest. Al Smith got an idea that would make the Empire State Building taler and beater. His idea would be more than a ""ornament"" ""their top, the said, would selrve a higher calling. The Empire State building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers."" He believed that he could use the building as a dock for dirigible, so people could get on and off. The proble was that that the frame would not work. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" They attempted to land dirigibles several times but they weren't able to do it at the end. ""In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough."" The air currents around the skyscraper were too violent and unpredictable for the large, slow-moving airships. They could not fix the problem, and the ambitious vision for a downtown dirigible terminal was ultimately abandoned."
1222	16055	6	3	"The Empire State Building started out as a huge sky-skraper. Then Al Smith had to get all competitive and put his crew to full work. The crew had many obsticles to fufil. First off, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame, costing over sixty thousand dollars, a significant financial investment for the structural reinforcement. Second the men made a shiny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower, illuminated inside to serve as a beacon. next they had to add four wings or shiny aluminum to rise a conical roof for housing the mooring arm, which was intended to secure the airships.  Fourth the crew has to add stairs and elevators to accomidate the ""blimps"" passengers, ensuring they could be transported from the great height down to street level.  And lastly they would add a couple of observation rooms to the eighty-sixth and 102 floors to provide viewing areas.  Smith's men worked hard and over came many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building, though the final outcome was not as they had hoped."
1223	16056	6	3	"Architects and builders faced several obstacles when attempting to build the empire state building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was S keeping a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire, creating a significant hazard in a densely populated city. One example of this is in paragraph seven, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey,"" a tragic event that highlighted the inherent dangers. Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made docking dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast, making it impossible to maintain a stable connection. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph eight, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area, presenting a legal barrier that could not be bypassed. All of these obstacles could not be overcome so in the end the mooring mast was not successful and remained an unused architectural feature."
1224	16057	6	3	"There were a lot of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, they wanted to add more hight to the Empire State Building so it can be, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream"" the planners said. Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" to support this ambitious addition. Then they, ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at it's corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms"". The roof had to be completed before the mask can take place, adding to the construction timeline. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself, specifically the powerful and unpredictable wind currents at that altitude. In conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, a vision that was ultimately grounded by practical realities."
1225	16058	6	3	"It is within our obligations as human beings to have dreams and want to convert them into reality. Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the empire state building is one I'd consider to be rather erratic. There were many obstacles that proved from early on, the fate of this project was failure. It is apparent from very early into the constructions that this was surreal because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Having dirigibles cruising through a large city should have been perceivably impossible to Al Smith, even before the construction of the building occurred, due to the obvious spatial challenges. Safety was also something to be seriously taken into consideration since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" which also intertwined with the laws of objects flying too low over an urban area. The combination of these fundamental issues made the entire concept impractical from its inception, a dream that was perhaps too ambitious for its time."
1226	16059	6	3	The first obstacle was to make the Empire State Building the world's tallest building by adding a top or a hat to make the building a little more taller, a design change intended to accommodate the dirigible mast. And the second obstacle was to drop people from the mooring mast to the Empire State building's flat roof, requiring a safe and efficient method for passenger transfer. These challenges, while considered, proved difficult to implement in practice.
1227	16060	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were quite apparent. One obstacle was that of nature, winds atop the building were at high speeds and always changing, this would make the dirigible unstable and difficult to dock securely to the mast. Another obstacle they faced was that of the passengers and bystanders safety; the dirigible could become uncontrollable in the turbulent winds, putting many lives in danger on the ground and on the airship itself. The last obstacle the builders faced was that of a law against flying airships too low over urban areas, it would make it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State building. The many obstacles that the builders faced ultimately blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State building.
1228	16061	6	3	The obstacles the builders would have to face would be things such as structural integrity, and worrying about future technological advances. Even if they found out how to land a dirigible on the platform, what about advances on them or new transportation methods that could render the entire docking system obsolete. The structural integrity was considered a quick fix, by reinforcing the supports to the building itself to handle the additional load and stress from a moored airship. However, the long-term viability of the concept remained in doubt due to the rapid pace of innovation.
1229	16062	6	3	"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof; a dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed from the constant pulling and shifting. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating, creating an immense safety risk that was hard to mitigate. One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself;"" winds at the top were constantly changing and the back of the ship would move around the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner; in open fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done in the city. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed."
1230	16063	6	3	The first obstacle came when the Chrysler Building had changed its height, sparking a competition for the title of world's tallest. They created the mooring mast and made the Empire State Building several feet higher to secure this distinction. Then they figured out that the mast would add stress to the building's frame, requiring further structural analysis. Then with the new laws and the Hindenburg disaster, it became clear that the mooring mast would not work-out from both a legal and a practical safety standpoint. So they gave up trying to make it useful for its intended purpose.
1231	16064	6	3	"First, there was no practical way to anchor any dirigibles securely. They couldn't make the back of the airship stable, only if they added heavy lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street where they would pose a direct danger to pedestrians. Second, there were specific laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings, creating a legal barrier. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" highlighting the catastrophic risk. Furthermore, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building or maintain a stable position. All in all it was a bad idea that was ultimately abandoned for safety and practical reasons."
1232	16065	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that was faced was the building's existing foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted, nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This became an obstacle because the building had already been built, so they'd have to work around the existing foundation and reinforce it substantially. Another obstacle that was faced was a specific law. The law stated ""no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas."" This became an obstacle because they had to convince government people it was safe, which proved to be a difficult regulatory hurdle. Finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was an obstacle because winds could get so bad that the dirigible tied up could rip the roof off and hurt the people below, presenting an uncontrollable danger. In conclusion, that is how the builders in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1233	16066	6	3	The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The first one to come into play was the structural support of the building itself. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduce the stability of the building, threatening its integrity. Over sixty thousand dollars went into modifications of the building's framework to try and address this issue. Another significant problem was the dirigibles themselves. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen, a highly volatile gas. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg incident, hydrogen is highly flammable and dangerous. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accident such as this would be even more devastating over a densely populated area like New York City. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people.
1234	16067	6	3	When constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building it seemed as if the engineers looked past all of its flaws. Safety was probably one of the biggest issues for the mooring mast. It was said most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of the safer helium. Thus causing a higher risk to explode, which was a major concern. After the events of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they were very afraid of what would happen if it occurred above downtown Manhattan. Nature was believed to be its biggest obstacle as well. Winds at the top of the air always shifted violently due to air currents, making docking nearly impossible. The back of the ships would swivel around and around the mooring mast uncontrollably. Legal restrictions were another major reason. Dirigibles were not allowed to fly a certain height over urban areas. Making it illegal to even approach the area where the building was located. Al Smith really should have done some more studying about what could have gone wrong with his mooring mast before proceeding with the plan.
1235	16068	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. First off, a dirigible moored to the mast by just one cable would put enormous stress on the frame of the building, requiring significant reinforcement. The building's frame had to be strengthened first to allow such a project to be considered feasible. When the mast was finished, several other problems prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of the safer, non-flammable helium. Earlier, the German blimp Hindenburg had been destroyed because hydrogen was so flammable. It was realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic should it happen over a densely populated city like New York. Also, blimps moored to the mast would be blown around by violent winds, possibly pushing them into nearby buildings and causing further damage. The lead weights normally used to prevent this would have had to be left dangling over pedestrians, a major safety issue for anyone below. Furthermore, there was a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban settlements, making use of the mast illegal from the outset. These combined problems doomed the mooring mast project from the very start.
1236	16069	6	3	The fact that these dirigibles are so big and filled with hydrogen and helium the point at the top would have poped it. The immense size of the airships made them particularly vulnerable to being punctured by the sharp tip of the mast. Also the Winds were always too high so they would never be able to connect the blimp to the building, as the airships would be tossed about uncontrollably. Lastly the fact that the German dirigible, Hindenburg burned like that they were afraid for that to happen. The catastrophic fire created a lasting fear of a similar disaster occurring. Especially in a crowded area such as New York, where the loss of life and property damage would have been immense, this risk was deemed unacceptable.
1237	16070	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles. The frist major problem they came across was the biulding its self. It said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the biuldings foundation."" The biulding being the tallest in the world could not take the pressure from a massive airship pulling on it. They could possible made it strong but at high cost to something so @CAPS1 already. The architects next obstienle was saftey expessally in a highly populated area such as down town New York. They found the Dirigibles to be to dangerous and uncontroble in a city of towers, where their large size and susceptibility to wind made navigation perilous. The normal processes of docking a Dirigible would have to complete change to acumulate. the mooring mast, soon laws were given to have airships stay away from areas of popurtion after the Hindenburg insodent. Yet some still dared to try and dock at the mast such as the Los Angeles and Columbia but the mast was never put to good use and shows the Problems with inovating things already @CAPS1 as the Empire State building, a visionary concept that was ultimately impractical."
1238	16071	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a significant fire hazard. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians, posing a serious danger to people on the streets below. Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings, such as spires and radio antennas. These combined factors made the entire endeavor too risky to pursue.
1239	16072	6	3	"Architects and builders working on building a docking platform on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. The first problem builders came across was the possibility that the building's framework was not potentially strong enough to support a dirigible's weight. It was said in paragraph nine that ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, and that was too risky. Another obstacle that builder's came across ""was nature itself."" @CAPS1 some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, it was feared that the winds on top of the building would be too intensely violent and be destroyed by flammable gas, leading to a catastrophic explosion. The next obstacle builders faced was public safety. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 dirigibles could not approach the dock over the area for sake of the citizens of New York. All of these problems eventually led to ""the idea of using the mooring mast [to be] shelved,"" ending the ambitious plan."
1240	16073	6	3	After reading excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off, but this structure was novel and untested. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame. This pressure along with the wind pressure would have to be converted all the way to the buildings foundation, placing an enormous strain on the entire structure. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making a secure connection nearly impossible. Although was a bright idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out properly, remaining a fascinating but failed experiment in aviation history.
1241	16074	6	3	Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, rather than helium like a balloon. This raises significant safety issues for the dense urban city below. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. These powerful wind currents made the precise maneuvering required for docking extremely hazardous. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction, serving as a landmark feature rather than a functional aviation dock.
1242	16075	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was supposed to serve, docking dirigibles, was something the original design of the building could not handle. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to reinforce the structure. Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originally designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock. These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Due to the location of the Empire State building in downtown New York, a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, they did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock, becoming a symbolic spire."
1243	16076	6	3	"In the excerpt the obstacles the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"". (p. @NUM1) @CAPS1 were trying to attempt a suitable landing area to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on. @CAPS1 try to attempt an electric winch. This ""would swing in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking gangplank to an open observation platform."" The biggest obstacle, @CAPS1 of the Empire State building was to ""nature itself"" which meant that dirigibles moored in open landing fields, where they would be high above pedestrians on the street where it was neither practical nor safe. The unpredictable and powerful weather conditions at such a great height presented a fundamental challenge that engineering could not easily overcome. @CAPS1 of the Empire State attempted these causes to allow dirigibles to enter on the property of the Empire State Building, but the inherent dangers of the environment ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a routine operation."
1244	16077	6	3	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The safety of the people were at stake, nature was also a great obstacle, the other reason was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it was against the law. First of all, the builders obstacle that they completely forgot about was the safety of the people. Most of the blimps from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen other than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. And they did not want to risk anyone getting hurt in a densely populated area where a fire would be catastrophic. Also, another big obstacle was @CAPS1 nature itself. At times the winds would be violent and it would go back and forth. And if a blimp was attached, it would be dangling violently over citizens had not nearly safe. Lastly, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas and New York was highly dense. And the reason for this law is for nothing bad to happen to the citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles the builders had gone through, and they were blinded by the project and they wanted to get it done they forgot about safety, leading to a structure that was more visionary than viable."
1245	16078	6	3	There would have been multiple obstacles when allowing a dirigibles to dock a the top of the empire state building. One it may get very densely populated with taller buildings, creating a complex urban canyon that is difficult to navigate. Since they had never made one before something could go wrong with the docking procedure or the structural integrity under such novel stresses. And last like the Hindenburg another disaster like that could happen but this time in a densly populated city, magnifying the potential for tragedy. These combined factors of urban density, untested technology, and catastrophic risk made the entire concept impractical from the start.
1246	16079	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. They would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast without having it swing in the wind. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM1), creating a significant hazard. Another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building was designing the mast itself. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM2) and expect it to function. The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand the considerable weight of the mast and the dynamic forces of a docked airship. Ultimately, these engineering and safety challenges proved difficult to overcome."
1247	16080	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the making of the mast. The first obstacle was that of the building's stability. The excerpt states ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"". This shows that in order for the mast to even be built the structure of the entire building would need to be altered to accommodate the use of the mast and the additional loads. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual use of the mast, was nature. In hopes of docking the dirigibles to the mast, mother nature would not allow it, as it @CAPS1 in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They also warned that with those air currents the passengers would not make it off of the dirigible safely due to the end of the dirigible floating rapidly undocked. They feared that if they docked the end it would be unsafe to the pedestrians below just as the helium in the dirigible would of as well, leading to the eventual abandonment of the plan."
1248	16081	6	3	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, until finally they called it quits. According to the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Chrysler building in New York City was about to be the height of the not-built Empire State, creating a competitive pressure. The weight and strength of a dirigible could damage the entire building so it would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the blimp to be able to land safely. The engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability that dirigibles tend to have. In paragraph @NUM1, L¸sted describes a dirigible that exploded in New Jersey not long ago, and that constructing a landing pad over the densely populated New York City, could be detrimental. The constructors of the mooring mast finally came to the conclusion that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM2). The blimps are held down with lead weights and this could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to ever go wrong. The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot to think about in regards to constructing the dirigible dock, and in the end, it was for the better that they decided against it for safety reasons."
1249	16082	6	3	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon L¸sted, explains how the spire of the Empire State Building was originally meant to be used as a mooring mast. This purpose of the spire was never to be fulfilled because of the numerous problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the biggest problems that the builders faced were unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds posed to be a problem because even though the front of the dirigible would be tethered to the mast the back end would be allowed to swing freely in the wind which could cause it to crash into another moored dirigible. The winds also would make just getting to the Empire a hazardous job for the pilots. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous over a densely populated area like Manhattan. Lastly, the air laws were a problem because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal from the start."
1250	16083	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents, and existing laws, in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The first obstacle the builders had encountered was the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles outside the United States. Hydrogen is considered highly flammable, a big safety issue. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York."" (@NUM1) If this had occurred in New York the damage could of been a lot worse. Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) this is very dangerous because of pedestrians on the street below. The final obstacle was an already existing law that prohibits airships flying low over urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building."" (@NUM3) this law would not allow dirigible to approach New York safely. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the owners of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents and existing laws in attempting to allow dirigible dock at the building, and these challenges ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a reality."
1251	16084	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant and multifaceted. A primary concern was the immense structural stress involved; the force of a thousand-foot dirigible, held by a single cable tether, combined with the wind pressure at such a height, could have caused serious problems for the building's foundation and frame. Safety was another critical issue, as most dirigibles outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of the safer helium. The tragic destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in New Jersey on May 6, 1937, starkly illustrated this danger, an accident that would have been far more catastrophic in the densely populated heart of New York. Furthermore, an existing law against airships flying too close over urban areas presented a legal barrier. This combination of structural, safety, and regulatory challenges ultimately proved insurmountable for the dirigible docking concept, leading to its practical abandonment.
1252	16085	6	3	Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty was the immense structural stress; a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, requiring it to be transmitted all the way to the foundation. This necessitated over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework, a challenge the builders were able to overcome. After the building's completion, however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for its full purpose because of more persistent challenges. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another operational concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around dangerously. While dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The final, definitive challenge facing the mooring mast was the preexisting law against low-flying aircraft, which ultimately put an end to Al Smith's ambitious dreams for the mast.
1253	16086	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were considerable. The prediction is that he did not want the airships around because the Empire State Building was simply too high, and the blimps would be floating precariously right above it, suggesting that something may have gone wrong, which is what Al Smith seemed worried about. This is supported by his own statement, where he said, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" The tone of this statement reveals a sense of confusion and uncertainty about the whole situation, indicating that the practical challenges of safely docking a massive airship to the skyscraper were not fully resolved and were a source of significant apprehension."
1254	16087	6	3	There were many obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the sheer size of the airships; some dirigibles were nearly a thousand feet long, which was equivalent to four blocks in New York City. This was a significant problem because attaching such a massive object by a single tether would add tremendous stress to the building's frame. To accommodate this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be substantially strengthened and modified. The next obstacle was nature itself, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For example, the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles once approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds; the captain could not even take his hands off the control lever. Another obstacle was a critical safety issue; while the builders noted that dirigibles in open fields are weighted down by lead, doing so high above the city would be dangerous since the weights would be dangling directly over pedestrians on the street. The final and perhaps most definitive obstacle they faced was the law against flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the mooring mast impractical.
1255	16088	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle was the extreme and unpredictable winds at that altitude, which were constantly shifting and could violently blow the airships through the air, making a safe and stable docking procedure nearly impossible. Another significant obstacle was the fuel used by foreign dirigibles; many relied on highly flammable hydrogen instead of the inert helium, creating an immense fire hazard, a danger tragically highlighted by the Hindenburg disaster. The last major obstacle the builders faced was a legal one: a law that did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas, which directly prohibited the close approach and docking maneuver required. Consequently, the builders of the Empire State Building dealt with a complex combination of environmental, safety, and regulatory reasons that ultimately prevented dirigibles from ever routinely docking on the building's mast.
1256	16089	6	3	Many significant obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. A primary concern was the danger posed by non-U.S. dirigibles attempting to dock. The problem with that was their use of hydrogen instead of helium, a gas which is highly flammable and volatile. Officials thought about the German dirigible that had crashed and realized how much worse the disaster would be if it happened in the densely populated downtown New York area. Another critical issue being nature's unpredictable wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggressively shifting, creating unstable conditions for a large, buoyant aircraft. Furthermore, using heavy lead weights like they did when landing in open fields would be a severe hazard for the people on the streets far below. Finally, existing law was a major issue. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier. Though two dirigibles attempted to dock, they both experienced first hand the inherent dangers of the operation, proving the concept to be unfeasible.
1257	16090	6	3	"Based on expert analysis, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the skyscraper was never thought of as an easy task to accomplish. As it was mentioned in the article, the idea of the dirigible mooring mast was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" One obstacle the builders would face is public safety. Since most of the dirigibles from outside the U.S.A. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is much more flammable, this presented a grave risk. This is a very dangerous obstacle because a fire in such a location would be catastrophic. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, however. If the winds are shifting violently, the dirigibles could be forced down or be left dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe for the people or the builders on the mast because the airship could crash and hurt them. Another obstacle builders would face is that there was a specific law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. It would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the building area. This made it harder for builders to accomplish their goal because the operation was fundamentally against the law from the start."
1258	16091	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by the organization, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were structural obstacles such as the fact that if a dirigible were tied to the building by a single tether it would ""add stress to the building's frame,"" potentially causing damage. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's structure. Another significant problem was that some foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable which would be very dangerous to have stationed over a densely populated area like midtown Manhattan. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By this, the author means that there are many violent and unpredictable air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around uncontrollably. To make sure this would not happen, heavy lead weights would have to be used which would not be practical or safe to have ""dangling high above pedestrians"" on the city streets. In the end, people realized there were far too many insurmountable problems involved in the use of a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State building."
1259	16092	6	3	"To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of the obstacles had dealt with the inherent dangers of the dirigible itself. For example, the dirigible was considered highly unsafe and flammable by the 1930s. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" Another formidable obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds at that altitude were constantly shifting due to violent air currents around the skyscraper. It would be highly dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with such powerful and unpredictable winds. Also, dirigibles could not legally fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area closely. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go through due to practical and safety limitations."
1260	16093	6	3	The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State building to accommodate dirigibles. One of those major obstacles was the building's frame work. When you are going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a large air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed structural frame. What they did was add special stainless steel and chrome-nickel windows to cut down on wind pressure. They spent over sixty thousand dollars on these and other modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building. The other main issue was the powerful air currents. You cannot strap a massive dirigible to a mast and believe the back of it would not start swaying back and forth dangerously. When you are almost a quarter mile in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height. If the dirigible ever came loose or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would likely crash and burn, endangering hundreds of pedestrians on the ground below. Al Smith had a great idea but he did not realize all the complex problems involved in making it a reality.
1261	16094	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to consider the structural stress of the building, as adding more weight and dynamic forces to the top would significantly increase the stress. The existing steel frame would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to meet the new needs, a process that would also be prohibitively expensive, costing over @MONEY1' worth of modifications. The builders also faced the critical obstacle of passenger and public safety. Most dirigibles used volatile hydrogen instead of non-flammable helium, and a hydrogen fire would not be safe in a dense urban environment. Furthermore, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" presented a significant legal barrier. Facing all these insurmountable obstacles, the builders ultimately decided to not go through with this ambitious idea."
1262	16095	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the dirigibles themselves because they typically used hydrogen rather than the safer helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and if a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area like Manhattan, it would be disastrous. However, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature itself. A mooring mast is used for docking large airships such as a dirigible or a zeppelin. With these massive and cumbersome aircraft, docking them on top of a skyscraper where winds are violently shifting is inherently very dangerous, as the back of the ship would swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast, posing a @CAPS1 threat. Dirigibles were normally moored in open land fields where they could be effectively weighed down with lead weights. With a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, it would dangle precariously high above city pedestrians, a situation that is neither @CAPS2 nor practicle. Constructing the Empire State Building had @CAPS3 more challenges and obsticles than its architects would have hoped for, and the dirigible docking plan proved to be one of the most formidable.
1263	16096	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had various problems to @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the airships, the added structural stress to the building, and overarching safety concerns were all aligned against the ludicrous idea of landing blimps on the skyscraper. The nature of the ships would cause the massive body to sway dangerously in the wind. One immediate problem that comes from this is the risk of tangling the crucial mooring cable. To combat this instability, captains would have to use heavy lead counterweights. These were highly impractical to use in a city because they would be hanging directly over crowded streets. Another serious problem was the added stress to the building's foundation and structural frame. Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, extensive modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these structural renovations was estimated at over sixty thousand dollars. The most obvious problem, however, was public safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and the area surrounding the building had other tall buildings with sharp spires on top. If a ship hit one of these, there was no stopping the ensuing disaster.
1264	16097	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, a previous dirigible tragedy, and the law. The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safety hazard because even if the front of the dirigible was secured, the back would swing wildly and cause a potential hazard due to the unpredictable and strong winds. Furthermore, to achieve lift, dirigibles were filled with hydrogen instead of helium, which is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration that this disaster could have been much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Given that dirigibles are very unsafe, this created many insurmountable obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow them to dock there."
1265	16098	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the Empire State building taller than its actually supposed to be. Like in @CAPS1 three, Al Smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building to a rival project. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a new, unprecedented height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building, a mooring mast for dirigibles, and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Another obstacle they faced was a specific law prohibiting airships from flying too low above urban areas. They made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building, as flying too low is a huge safety hazard; a single accident could potentially take the lives of hundreds of people on the streets below.
1266	16099	6	3	In the excerpt there were multiple obstacles the builders faced when allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First was making the steel frame of the building stronger to withstand the immense forces involved. The builders also had to make the Empire State Building 102 stories tall, and make the 101st story an observatory, which required intricate planning and execution. The last obstacle they faced was the sheer scale and complexity of building the Empire State Building itself, a monumental task of engineering and construction. Those are the obstacles that the builders faced when constructing the Empire State Building, a testament to their ambition and skill.
1267	16100	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted there were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a huge dirigible held at the top of the building by a single cable would have stressed the rest of the building structure. In order to make the tower half of the building more stable they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications. The unpredictable nature of the weather was a key issue; the winds were violent because of air currents and even if the dirigibles were tied to the mast, the back would swivel around dangerously. Furthermore, the prospect of large dirigibles dangling above pedestrians was not safe. Another reason as to why dirigibles could not be docked at the top of the Empire State Building was because there was a law not allowing airships to fly so low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever dock ships there. Overall, these were some of the significant obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building."
1268	16101	6	3	"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the Empire State building was to be so much more than a simple skyscraper. The hazards of the gases in some of the dirigibles was a huge risk because some were highly flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well as the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds, creating a highly volatile environment. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had overlooked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea, making the mast concept out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would have had to deal with, the mast was never used for its intended purpose, and it was very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there."
1269	16102	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the architects faced many reasons in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects couldn't put a mooring mast at first because it would add significant stress to the building's frame. To address this, the architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to accomplish the new situation they were planning. Before putting the mooring mast in place, the architects designed a shiny glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower to have the overall shape of the building, integrating the mast into the aesthetic design. Even before constructing the mooring mast on top of the building the roof had to be completed as a foundational step. However, when putting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building; it didn't work out as intended. When they tested it the dirigible didn't get close enough to tie it up, demonstrating the practical infeasibility of the plan. So in the future, the mooring mast concept by Marcia Amidon Lusted did not work out for the iconic skyscraper."
1270	16103	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were significant, yet they developed ambitious plans hoping to achieve a greater and more spectacular structure. Their vision pushed the boundaries of engineering and design, aiming for an unprecedented architectural marvel. Despite the challenges encountered during construction, their determination to create an iconic landmark never wavered. This drive for excellence and innovation defined the entire project from its inception to its completion, ensuring the building would become a symbol of human ambition and capability for generations to come.
1271	16104	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had great plans to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. Although they kept their expectations high, they faced many obstacles while trying to make this happen. The first problem they ran into was the fact that the steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened due to the stress of the dirigible's load, a significant and costly structural challenge. So, the architects had to make changes to the building's skeleton. Safety was also a critical issue because hydrogen made the blimps flammable, which could cause a destruction by fire and posed a grave risk to the building and the city below. There was also an existing law stating ""airships can't fly to low over urban areas."" Consequently, dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to tie up to the building, let alone even reach that area. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to heavy winds, the dirigibles would swivel around too much, and the area was not open enough to weigh down the back with lead weights, making a stable and secure mooring practically unachievable. So, the architects of the Empire State Building faced too many insurmountable obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to successfully dock there."
1272	16105	6	3	When the Empire State Building was originally conceived, it was planned to be the tallest building. However not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. However in trying to do this the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, & this is where the first obstacle they faced comes into play. Since the dirigibles were so long the first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area amidst the dense urban landscape. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's roof. That plus a seven hundred ft dirigible moored at the top, we had stressed to the building's frame, requiring expensive reinforcements. This would be another obstacle the workers encountered. The mooring mask was destined to never fulfill its purpose, do to the safety of many people, as the volatile hydrogen gas created an unacceptable fire hazard. This was yet another obstacle the workers faced. The final obstacle and the practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the building, was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas, which legally prohibited the entire endeavor. These are the many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1273	16106	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allowing dirgibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there, as maintaining a stable position would be nearly impossible. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever more there, rendering the mooring mast legally useless from the start. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles.  With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people few on airships anymore, which diminished the practical need for such a docking station. In conclusion, several obstacles, from dangerous weather to legal restrictions and shifting public and commercial interest, prevented the docking of dirgibles to the Empire State Building."
1274	16107	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obsticles. In order for the dirigibles to anchor there, a mooring mast must be added. The architects then had to find a way to add ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" without adding stress to the buildings frame, a significant engineering puzzle. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was the nature itself"". Architects knew that they could not control the weather, and this worried them, as high winds would make any docking maneuver perilous. Another obsticle the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". If dirigibles were able to reach the building something could go wrong. Builders ""feared that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", creating a catastrophic scenario. The obsticles the builders faced soon became pointless when ""the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared"" as the ambitious plan was ultimately abandoned."
1275	16108	6	3	In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building the works set themselves a hard task. First they had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications so that the building would withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible, a substantial financial and structural investment. Also, a prexisting law made it immpossible for dirigibles to come as low to the city as they needed to be to dock, creating an immediate legal barrier. Finally constant changes in wind current and other weather made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible because the dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buidings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling precariously over pedestrians. Ultimately, the combination of these formidable challenges ensured that the vision of a dirigible terminal atop the skyscraper would never be realized.
1276	16109	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were comprehended too late. First, they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it was a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on, a specialized mast. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the building's frame"" and would be sent down all the way to its foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State Building was going to be, requiring significant structural reinforcement. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And there are many people and other buildings in the city that could be put in danger. Also, the weather takes a toll on how the dirigible is going to act in the air; if it's rough, it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" Essentially, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize the full extent of these challenges until it was too late."
1277	16110	6	3	The obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building were some big ones which led to several problems. For instance, there was a lack of a proper, stable landing area for the dirigible, as the building's spire was not designed for such a purpose. But the primary reason was the lack of safety, as the volatile nature of the airships and the inherent dangers of mooring them to a skyscraper in a densely populated area posed an unacceptable risk. There was simply too much that could go wrong, and therefore this dream could not be accomplished despite the initial ambition.
1278	16111	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely, which involved complex logistical planning. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall, a feat of engineering that seemed nearly impossible. The main obstacle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building,"" a costly and complicated undertaking. Ultimately, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end, it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title, even if the concept proved impractical."
1279	16112	6	3	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In the text, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible, making a secure docking impossible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail as a functional airship terminal."
1280	16113	6	3	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, she is basically explaining the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Examples from the text highlight the ambitious nature of the project. ""They said that the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank."" This indicates the initial vision was for a functional mast, but the practical challenges of wind, structural stress, and passenger safety proved too great to overcome, leading to the mast becoming largely a decorative feature."
1281	16114	6	3	While dirigibles were being invented and developed in the early 1930's, many workers and financial backers faced significant problems when trying to dock these airships. A dirigible was essentially a live propeller-driven craft that passengers could board and ride within a closed compartment suspended under the large, gas-filled balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions, dirigibles were a dangerous device, as indicated by the passage. From outside the United States, they used hydrogen for lift instead of the safer helium. The cause and effect of using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable, a fact tragically demonstrated by the German dirigible named Hindenburg, which exploded due to a fire on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles were a very dangerous transportation device used in the 1930's, and so by the late 1930's, the idea of wing-based transportational dirigibles faded away. Later on, the passenger baggage compartment from a dirigible was repurposed and made into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden, marking an odd end to the era.
1282	16115	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were primarily safety, nature itself, and the law. Safety was a paramount concern because dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable; a catastrophic accident could happen, as when the ""German dirigible Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature itself was the second problem because the violent air currents around the skyscraper could unpredictably shift the massive dirigible and cause structural damage or hurt pedestrians on the streets below. Law was the final and perhaps most definitive reason because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The statement in the excerpt says ""This law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building,"" which makes the entire endeavor of building the mooring mast quite pointless from the start."
1283	16116	6	3	"In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, we learn about how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually meant to be a landing spot for dirigibles. However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various compelling reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because the airships were mostly inflated with hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since a dirigible could possibly catch fire above the densely populated New York City. Next, there was the persistent problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent, and the tail of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around. Using lead weights to hold it down were a possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, though they should've seen them coming, in their futile attempt to get dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."
1284	16117	6	3	"Construction always has its inherent challenges. In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there are many specific challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to land dirigibles there. Some of the obstacles the builders faced included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the necessary modification of the building's frame, the significant cost, and the force of nature itself. Landing the dirigibles would be a hard task. For one, the dirigibles are enormous; they are ""a thousand-foot"" long flying devices. This would make it extremely difficult to land just because of its immense weight and size. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This is a struggle because the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified"" to handle such forces. This modification would take lots of engineering effort and careful planning. Plus, modification also brings up the problem of cost. There would have to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" That cost is mindblowing for the time and would create challenges of how to secure that money. In addition, nature itself was a formidable obstacle. Winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Nature would bring up many challenges for the builders to have to work around. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1285	16118	6	3	"The article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted talks about the competition for height between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architect who built the Chrysler Building was secretly hiding a final component. The secret was that he had constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building; it shocked many people and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing its final height to 1,046 feet, which is 46 feet taller than the originally planned height of the Empire State Building. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought that a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers on and off. However, the mooring mast couldn't just simply be dropped on top of the building. Adding a mooring mast with a cable tether could add immense stress to the building's steel frame, requiring significant structural reinforcement. They finally did build the mooring mast, and upon its completion, they raised the American flag once again to mark the achievement."
1286	16119	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a primary issue for the builders. The dirigibles made outside of the United States were used with hydrogen. This became a significant safety issue because ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" and posed a constant risk of fire. On top of the building, the wind is always shifting because of ""violent air currents"" present at such a high altitude. The shifting winds would be a major problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making a stable connection nearly impossible. Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas""; this regulation made it illegal to dock the dirigibles in the heart of the city. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing immense danger to the city and its inhabitants. There were many obstacles the builders faced that ultimately made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."
1287	16120	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This clearly indicates that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as stable conditions were rare. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This inherent flammability created an unacceptable risk for a densely populated urban area. Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above a city full of pedestrians, as a dropped weight would have catastrophic consequences. These combined factors presented insurmountable challenges to the docking plan."
1288	16121	6	3	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" Significant obstacles arose once the idea was proposed. Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause structural stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" to even attempt to support the loads involved. Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen that was highly flammable, creating a perpetual fire hazard. Then the obstacle of wind came into play, as the airships would be buffeted by powerful gusts. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The idea was never successful due to the multitude of obstacles presented from the outset."
1289	16122	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. This was a problem because it would add a lot of stress to the building's structural framework. And safety was a critical issue. The law restricted this operation because you can't put a blimp over urban areas; if something goes wrong a lot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task; it was very hard to make it support a blimp because there would be too much pressure on the building from the airship's pull and the wind. Lastly, safety was a concern because there were blimps that caught fire due to the flammable gases they used. If that were to happen in New York, a lot of innocent lives would be lost, making the entire venture far too dangerous to pursue.
1290	16123	6	3	"The builders faced many different obstacles in their attempt to allow blimps to dock there. There were two major obstacles. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a blimp had an accident like the Hindenburg, not only would the Empire State building be at risk, it would affect other buildings and people too because of the city's dense population. Lastly the other large effect on the building was the weather. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The winds could have easily knocked the building over with a blimp attached to it for this reason: ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" As a result of this, the blimp would be so close to the mast that if a strong enough wind was blowing, the blimp's weight and force could take the mast with it. All in all, weather and the use of hydrogen in blimps were the builders' two major obstacles."
1291	16124	6	3	"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plausible in theory, but as it was put in motion the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame, which required the entire steel structure to be reinforced to handle the significant load and wind pressure. The whole building had to be strengthened to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, creating powerful and unpredictable air currents, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights to control the back of the aircraft was impractical and posed a danger to the streets below. The prevention of nature's problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the United States used a more flammable hydrogen gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea, as a fire would threaten the densely populated urban area. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countries' blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over an urban area, creating a legal barrier that was nearly impossible to overcome. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equipp [the building] for an age of transportation,"" had to be given up, and the mast never served its intended purpose."
1292	16125	6	3	The problems that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the issues of safety. As said in the text, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which would have made it nearly impossible to keep a massive airship stable while tethered. Also said in the text, there would be lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street, creating a significant hazard for anyone below if the weights were to fall or the airship broke free. One other problem they faced were the existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal obstacle that would have been difficult and time-consuming to resolve. These combined safety and legal concerns ultimately proved insurmountable for the ambitious docking plan.
1293	16126	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be things such as the different usage of airship technology and the inherent dangers involved. A sentence I found to follow this reason would be in the text when said, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would cause many problems and face many obstacles, primarily the risk of a catastrophic fire high above the city streets. Another reasoning I found was wind, a natural force that presented a major challenge. A reason I found would be as stated in the text, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This would be something difficult to fix, requiring substantial and costly structural reinforcement. As other obstacles I found such as the size and density of the airships, I find these two to be the best reasoning for why the plan was ultimately abandoned, as the physical and environmental challenges were too great to overcome."
1294	16127	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable, creating an immense fire hazard. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof; the entire design required careful integration. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation and bear the immense stress from the dirigible's weight and the wind. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example downtown New York, highlighting the profound safety risks. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making stable mooring a physical impossibility. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, unable to be secured. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe, presenting an unacceptable public danger. These fundamental and unsolvable problems ensured the mooring mast would never be used as intended.
1295	16128	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were a few main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof without considering the structural implications. It would add unwanted stress to the building frame, requiring significant and costly reinforcement of the steel structure to handle the load. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flammable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densely populated area, downtown New York, threatening countless lives with a single spark. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem, creating unpredictable and powerful gusts. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast, making it impossible to safely secure the massive aircraft. A final dilemma was an existing law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas, such as New York, creating a legal barrier that was as formidable as the physical ones. Due to these obstacles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to fail, and the visionary plan was ultimately abandoned.
1296	16129	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems trying to make dirigibles able to dock there. One problem was that the blimps use hydrogen instead of helium to fly. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This inherent flammability meant the blimps were unable to be used because they were a major safety issue for the people being transported, posing a constant risk of fire. Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This unstable positioning was a critical flaw. Dirigibles are usually put down in open fields where the back ends can be secured with lead weights; the prospect of blimps dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Ultimately, the builders for the empire state building faced many obstacles that proved insurmountable for the intended purpose."
1297	16130	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast the builders of the empire state building had to go through many obstacles to get their job done. It states that Al Smith announces that the empire state building will reach a significant height, this would be a big obstacle for the builders because they have to risk their lives being that high up just to construct this building, facing dangers from the extreme elevation daily. Another obstacle for the workers would be working next to the dirigibles because in the excerpt it states that the dirigibles are extremely flammable so if it touches fire the workers could get seriously hurt. These combined dangers of height and flammable gas created a perilous work environment that the builders had to navigate carefully throughout the construction process.
1298	16131	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area, as the urban environment offered no open space for such a large aircraft. Another obstacle was getting the passengers on and off the dirigibles safely, a complex process that would involve transferring people from a swaying airship at a great height down into the building. In conclusion I have shown the obstacles that the builders have faced on the Empire State Building, highlighting the significant challenges involved in the ambitious plan."
1299	16132	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted describes the problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced like the amount of stress that the dirigibles would add to the frame of the building, safety issues and laws, and the winds around the mast. Any dirigible would add on tremendous stress to the already constructed frame of the building and builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" to reinforce the structure. These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed and could not be easily dismissed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing as was done in open fields. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought about before construction started, and the builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as ""a higher calling."""
1300	16133	6	3	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building with additional supports. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air where the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hydrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed, creating a catastrophic safety hazard for the city below. These fundamental issues ultimately made the concept impractical."
1301	16134	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there were primarily related to the building's great height. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications."" This proves that the height of the Empire State Building was a significant obstacle because the city had to pay substantial modification fees to reinforce the structure. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable, so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2: ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This demonstrates that a mast positioned in those unpredictable currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York, posing a risk to both the airship and the city below. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles, such as in paragraph @NUM3 where it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" This justifies that legal restrictions were also a critical obstacle that the builders faced, ultimately contributing to the plan's failure."
1302	16135	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles, one of them being the Mooring Mast itself. The building's original framework was not strong enough to hold a massive airship, which presented a fundamental engineering challenge. So the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation, requiring significant structural reinforcement. They would add a rocket-shaped tower built out of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel to serve as the mast. This tower would illuminate from the inside, creating a beacon, and its addition would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors, fundamentally altering the building's final design and height. I got all this information from paragraphs @NUM2, which detail the extensive efforts required to realize this ambitious but problematic feature.
1303	16136	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws regarding plane height, the fact that some dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium, and lastly, at such great heights, the strong wind currents were a problem as well. The restriction of plane height was that planes could not fly too low above cities without being a safety hazard, as indicated by ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (The Mooring Mast). Another obstacle related to the fact that some dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen fuel in place of helium, which could cause a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable and posed a fire risk over a populated area, as noted by ""from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an obstacle as well; the high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as they attempted to dock at the Empire State Building, which would pose a significant problem for safe mooring, as described by ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ranging from legal to technical and environmental challenges."
1304	16137	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight of the airships and the stress of mooring. The architects could not just place the mooring mast on the roof or it would rush the building's structural integrity, potentially causing damage. So they had to add over sixty thousand dollars into the framework to reinforce the building's core. Another problem was safety issues concerning the fuel used by foreign airships. Other countries used hydrogen as their dirigibles' lifting gas, and hydrogen is highly flammable so that catching on fire above New York was a dangerous possibility. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so getting passengers on and off board would be extremely dangerous to them, making the entire operation perilous. Also, there is a law in New York prohibiting low-flying vehicles, so the dirigibles could not have docked there in the first place, presenting a legal barrier from the outset.
1305	16138	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges ranged from nature itself to laws against it, creating a multifaceted problem. They didn't take into full consideration the constantly shifting air currents atop the building, which proved to be a major issue. At such heights as the mooring mast, violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast unpredictably. This was also due to the fact that the blimp would only be tethered in the front, leaving its tail vulnerable to being tossed by the wind. Not only were those large factors coming into play, but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State. They didn't think about the existing law which was a significant oversight. It stated that airships flying too low over urban areas was against the law, effectively prohibiting the docking maneuver. So many factors came into play with building such a project that the initial vision was compromised. Overall, the idea of a skyscraper airship terminal was too far-fetched to be practically realized.
1306	16139	6	3	There were a few obstacles to making this idea work. One of the obstacles was to make the mast and the frame of the building strong enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind, which would exert considerable force on the structure. There was over sixty thousand dollars spent on modification to the building to reinforce its steel skeleton. Also, they had to add a few floors to the building for a total of 102 floors, which increased the overall height and further complicated the structural engineering required for the ambitious mooring mast project. These physical and financial challenges were significant from the outset.
1307	16140	6	3	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg disaster illustrated so tragically. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good, potentially causing catastrophic loss of life. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would neither be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small mooring on the top of a building is no open field, creating a clear public hazard. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" Without a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face, making the entire concept fraught with difficulty."
1308	16141	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had, overlooking fundamental issues with the urban location. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in the text, but this only highlighted the impracticality of the mast. In another section it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself, with high-altitude winds making stable docking nearly impossible. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many, including safety regulations and the inherent instability of the airships. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there, and these challenges ultimately proved insurmountable for the project's long-term success.
1309	16142	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. For the concept to work, there wasn't enough room on the confined rooftop for the large and cumbersome airships to maneuver safely and be secured properly. Furthermore, they weren't supposed to have aircraft near the city according to existing aviation regulations, which prohibited such low-altitude flight over urban areas. These fundamental issues of space and legality presented major hurdles that the builders could not easily overcome, dooming the dirigible docking concept from the start.
1310	16143	6	3	Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigibles dangling nearly a quarter of a mile above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the buildings frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about a quarter of a mile down. In order for this to work the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building considerably. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown of course and into another building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place they should have checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. Builders of this landing dock and the empire state building just faced too many obstacles, which collectively ensured the mooring mast would never be a practical success.
1311	16144	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mostly due to the dangers of violent winds at such an altitude that may cause the aircraft to crash either into the building or down to the ground. For example, two blimps attempted the docking and one of them could not come close to the building because of the powerful winds. The other was able to deliver a bundle of newspapers hoisted down by a rope, but this was a minor success that did not prove the safety or practicality of the concept. In conclusion, the main problem was the instability of the aircraft being docked, a fundamental issue that made the entire venture too hazardous to continue.
1312	16145	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. One of the obstacles they faced was safety, because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". If the dirigible burst into flames in New York, a lot of people would die. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds were violent on top of the building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This would have been very dangerous for both the airship and the people below. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Although this was broken twice, it was still illegal to dock dirigibles at that low height. As a cause of all these obstacles, the idea to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately scrapped."
1313	16146	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because they had to plan out how it would work and what they would need to use for it to dock there. This involved complex logistical questions about what kinds of material would be needed in this project and how the entire docking process would function. They needed to design a system that could securely moor a large, floating aircraft to the skyscraper's mast. Before actually putting it all together, these fundamental planning and design challenges proved to be significant hurdles that needed to be overcome for the concept to become a reality.
1314	16147	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles. One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good and integrating it with the building's design. The other, most main reason or problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue, but a big one. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable. So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode and go down in a densely populated area. There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved in theory, like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible, yet such solutions were impractical and highlighted the inherent dangers of the plan.
1315	16148	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders had to face many obstacles. A lot of obstacles were straightforward and not overlooked by the planners; for example, on page three it says that it was ""unsafe because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen"" which is highly flammable. There were precedents in the public consciousness because of them being flammable; the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, a recent and tragic event that underscored the risk. There was also the challenge of violent air currents at that altitude and a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These combined factors created an insurmountable barrier to the docking plan's success."
1316	16149	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first issue faced was that ""most of dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was an issue because if the dirigible would catch fire or explode over a highly populated city like New York, many people would be put at risk of being injured or killed. The second issue the builders had to face was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would cause the airship to swivel, even when tethered to the mooring mast, making it impossible to board and creating a dangerous situation for anyone aboard the airship. The third issue was that there ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With New York City certainly being an urban area, this law made it impossible for airships to even approach the Empire State Building to moor. Overall, there were many obstacles faced by builders in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these reasons, the Empire State Building was never an effective place for dirigibles to dock."
1317	16150	6	3	Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building brought up many challenges for the builders. There was a huge safety issue having the blimps so close to the city. The fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people, as the air currents at such a height were unpredictable and powerful. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flammable gas, and if the blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City, endangering countless lives. The last major concern was the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; in fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City and the passengers of the dirigible safe. These combined factors rendered the ambitious docking plan unfeasible from the start.
1318	16151	6	3	"One of the obstacles builders faced was nature itself. The text states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which presented a significant and uncontrollable hazard to any airship attempting to approach or moor. Another obstacle the builders faced was that ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The text further states ""This law will make it illegal for a ship to ever be tied up to the building,"" creating a legal barrier that was impossible to circumvent. These fundamental issues of safety and regulation proved insurmountable for the project's success."
1319	16152	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had a few obstacles to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as written by Marcia Amidon Lusted in ""The Mooring Mast."" Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, didn't want his masterpiece to be only for show, so he gave it purpose; a dock for dirigibles. By adding a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the building's frame would be under much stress, ultimately making the structure unsafe. To alter the frame and withstand the wind pressure, a great deal of money would need to be accumulated. If an accident were to take place, like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger from fire and falling debris. Although some obstacles can be overcome, the obstacle of mother nature herself, with its powerful and unpredictable winds, cannot be controlled."
1320	16153	6	3	"As it was, the idea of a dirigible dock was quite far-fetched. The first problem they encountered was that having a thousand-foot-long dirigible attached to the Empire State Building would cause a great strain on the building's framework; they would have to change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework, a prohibitively expensive undertaking. The largest problem was a matter of safety. Dirigibles use hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, and also the author states ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making the idea of a dirigible dock extremely risky for both the airship and the city below. They should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock, as the fundamental challenges were too great to overcome."
1321	16154	6	3	"Builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the dirigible would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed there. The building would have to be modified, costing over sixty thousand dollars more in structural reinforcements. Another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible. Some used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe for the public below. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong and unpredictable. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast,"" making a stable connection nearly impossible. The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building,"" presenting a legal barrier. The attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building failed as there were simply too many obstacles to overcome."
1322	16155	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. For example, the author said ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This shows that not only did they have to design the structure to take the load of the building but also the additional force from the dirigible. Moreover the author stated that, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether,"" would be highly unstable. The engineers would have to think of a way to safely dock the dirigible without anyone getting hurt, a complex challenge given the immense size of the airships. In all, the engineers that designed the Empire State building had to overcome many significant obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there."
1323	16156	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The builders could not simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" without considering the structural implications. The builders now had to find a way to add this mooring mast for dirigibles without putting too much pressure on the existing structure. In addition, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They now had to add ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications to the building's frame to handle the new loads. In conclusion, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Ultimately, the architects went through much work not only to make the mooring mast for dirigibles successful, but also beautiful. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" shows the many obstacles architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1324	16157	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders ""main obstacle were the wind currents the dirigibles had to face in trying to dock nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The harsh winds at the top of the building were constantly changing because of the air currents, making navigation extremely difficult. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even get close enough to tie up to the mast. ""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" in fear the outer shell would be punctured by the mast. Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would be moving all around the mast based on the unpredictable air currents, creating a hazardous situation. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Therefore, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building was very unsafe, as the obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome."
1325	16158	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable and risk damaging the structure. But most importantly, since the winds kept changing it would never stay still, making a secure docking procedure impossible. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it too dangerous to the public, as a spark could cause a catastrophic fire. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock, and the plan was ultimately abandoned."
1326	16159	6	3	"There were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the many obstacles the dirigibles had to face was the lack of a suitable landing area, which I found on paragraph six, as the mast itself was not designed for the complex process of securing such a large and volatile aircraft. Another obstacle would be on paragraph @NUM1 where it says ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This created an immense safety risk high above the city streets. Nature itself would be another obstacle for the dirigibles, because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making a stable approach and docking procedure nearly impossible. @CAPS1 but not least, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Which means it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even go near the area, rendering the entire concept legally unfeasible from the start. In conclusion these were some out of the many obstacles a dirigible had to face, proving the plan to be impractical."
1327	16160	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long dirigible would exert a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added to reinforce the structure. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the Hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York, highlighting the catastrophic potential of such an event. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas, but the factor of nature made the mooring mast idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to violent air currents; even the captain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible safely during a test. At this point it was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work. And dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived, sealing the fate of the ambitious docking scheme.
1328	16161	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to accommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below, requiring significant structural reinforcement. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders faced was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic, a risk the city was not willing to take. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast, making a secure connection dangerous. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, and the plan was ultimately forsaken.
1329	16162	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time were floating by hydrogen rather than helium, which was safer but not widely available outside the United States. What the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city, creating an unacceptable hazard. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those atop the building were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky and difficult to control. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying too low over urban areas presented a legal barrier that could not be overcome. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders to face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream, never realized in practice.
1330	16163	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem was designing the building to be able to withstand the stress from a thousand-foot dirigible swinging around it in the wind. The builders needed to find a way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation, a significant engineering challenge for such a tall structure. Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, it kept being tossed about by the strong winds, this problem was never solved despite several attempts. A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch, but that was a minor success compared to the larger issues. A final problem was the fact that the dirigibles were so dangerous, and couldn't safely dock, as well as a law that prevented dirigibles from flying close to buildings, which was created for that very reason of public safety. Ultimately, the combination of structural, natural, and legal barriers proved insurmountable for the project.
1331	16164	6	3	During this time period, dirigibles were widely seen as the transportation of the future, and everybody thought that this was a plausible development. There were significant problems, however, that nobody seemed to see through at the time. For example, the dirigibles were promoted to be the next big thing in transatlantic and urban transportation, but there was little to no concrete evidence to support this ambitious claim. They spent all of their available time, considerable effort, and vast resources to construct something for a purpose that ultimately never worked as intended. There were other critical problems that were overlooked as well, such as the consistently high wind speed at that extreme height, and even if they could somehow get close enough to the mast, they would then need someone to stand on the very top and manually tie it down, which would be far too hard and dangerous for one person to accomplish. As the excerpt clearly shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this complex problem too quickly and with insufficient information, leading to an impractical and ultimately abandoned venture.
1332	16165	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, two architects are depicted playing a game of ""battleship"" with each of their dirigible designs, competing aggressively for the most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't fully realize the severe obstacles that they would have to face during this complex construction process. The biggest reason for concern was for essential safety precautions. Since most dirigibles of that era were filled with hydrogen gas, they were highly flammable and posed a grave risk. This, they said, could have resulted in a disaster even worse than the German Hindenburg, which was famously demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best and most insurmountable obstacle to the use of the mast was nature itself. The powerful and unpredictable winds caused the mast's structure to be clanging noisily above human beings on the streets below, which was neither practical nor safe for any potential operation."
1333	16166	6	3	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many complex problems. One of the more obvious and dangerous issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted primarily of hydrogen, which, although it allowed for a lower density and better lift, was highly flammable and volatile. This inherent danger was tragically proven and brought to international light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous German dirigible. If a similar dirigible were to catch fire while attempting docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the crowded streets and civilians below. Another serious topic of debate for the architects was the issue of the consistently high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such strong winds could easily cause a severe lack of stability for a large dirigible which could in turn place added structural stress on the building itself. Another related problem caused by these winds is the fact that the drifting dirigible might crash into other nearby buildings, causing the fragile fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and leading to the inevitable crash of the airship. In the end, it was a project deemed far too risky and impractical to continue."
1334	16167	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many formidable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was they weren't sure if the fundamental structure of the building could hold up to the constant strain of a massive, swaying dirigible attached to its pinnacle. As said in paragraph @NUM1, this was a primary structural concern. Also the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by only a single cable, the powerful air currents would make the back of the ship swivel wildly around the fixed mooring mast, creating immense and unpredictable forces. As said in paragraph @NUM2, this dynamic movement posed a significant challenge. There also was a law enforcement regulation against airships flying too low over densely populated urban areas, which was a critical legal hurdle. That existing law would make it effectively illegal for a large airship to tie up to the building in the first place. Those are some of the key obstacles that the builders were faced with, which ultimately contributed to the concept's failure.
1335	16168	6	3	The Empire State Building was designed from the outset to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's initial plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1-foot tall spire was added to the top of the rival building, the Empire State Building was going to come in a disappointing second. To overcome this first major obstace in building the world's tallest tower, Smith decided to cleverly change the idea for the tower and add his own distinctive spire: a functional mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for the giant dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower's height, securing the title. But to continue with this ambitious plan, Smith had to face the formidable obstacle of supporting a massive floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame substantially modified and strengthened with additional steel supports before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the very top of the building were far too harsh and variable for safe docking, so the dirigible idea was eventually scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had nevertheless made it to the world's tallest building, achieving its primary goal.
1336	16169	6	3	"Throughout the process of construction the Empire State Building contractors faced a couple of significant obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it. First off, safety was a huge factor of the quest. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York."" Although a balloon and dirigible may have the same appearance the two are completely structured differently. Helium causes a balloon to rise, but a dirigible often uses hydrogen to fly which is highly flammable. Secondly there was already a law put into effect for air trafficking. Furthermore, the dirigibles ""... could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the shell."" If the dirigible was to ever get punctured it could collapse into the streets of New York causing mass destruction. Thus concluding a few of the many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
1337	16170	6	3	The Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles and challenges while it was being built, particularly concerning the plan for dirigibles. The builders constructed a rocket-shaped mast so the dirigible could be housed in the shaft itself. This innovative mast also had elevators so people could disembark and go down to the lobby directly. With this addition, the building would now be 102 floors tall. The glassed observation room would be on the 101st floor, offering a unique vantage point. Despite these ambitious architectural features, the practical challenges of docking an airship proved too great to overcome.
1338	16171	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire over New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened considerably. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face these many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately rendering the plan unfeasible.
1339	16172	6	3	"The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future. As it turns out, however, architect Al Smith bit off more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg put worry over the owners heads. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that (Hindenburg) accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. As stated, ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approch the area"". The final and most problematic part of the mooring mast was actually revealed to be nature itself. As it turns out, the wind on top of the building were too violent and unpredictable. Even if the dirigible was tethered, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". Overall, it seems like this was a great idea gone bad due to these insurmountable issues."
1340	16173	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. The aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flammable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occurring in a highly populated area. Another obstacle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and off and also for handling cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas. By a dirigible docking it would be directly breaking the law, which ultimately prevented the ambitious plan from ever being realized.
1341	16174	6	3	"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied in a practical manner, and would also prove to be hazardous if they were to fall. Given the Empire State Building's nature and structural design, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty to the construction process. The powerful and unpredictable winds at that altitude would also provide significant docking issues and cause instability for any airship attempting to moor. Finally, the rapid development of the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Ultimately, blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped."
1342	16175	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock where nature and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the tail of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Then, the plan for using lead weights in the Empire State Building presented another danger, as they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe. The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This regulation made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building, rendering the entire concept impractical from a legal standpoint."
1343	16176	6	3	The Empire State Building was built with great potential, but it would never reach it fully. The Empire State Building was supposed to reach a certain height, being just inches taller than the Chrysler Building, when the architect who designed the Chrysler Building snuck up and stuck a 46 foot pole on top. Of course the Empire State Building had to be taller, so they set a new goal and reached 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. Al Smith, former governor of New York and a key figure in the project, decided that the Empire State Building needed a cherry on top, so he decided to put a mooring mast for zeppelins on top. This plan was destined for disaster: the foundation wasn't stable enough for zeppelins, they could easily be blown out of control and onto the sharp tip of the Building, and also, since zeppelins had hydrogen in them, they could explode and fall onto the densely populated city below. All in all, the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building was built for disaster from the very beginning.
1344	16177	6	3	There are many obstacles the builders had to face while attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles. One obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars' to the worth of modifications for the building's framework. In a relevant paragraph, it stated that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation, requiring significant reinforcement. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place, creating a complex construction sequence. The mast also had to have a skeleton of steel, as stated in another paragraph, to even attempt to withstand the forces involved.
1345	16178	6	3	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so legally. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe to suspend such heavy weights over the city. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners that the plan was ultimately abandoned.
1346	16179	6	3	"The builders faced a significant obstacle in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. For one, the mooring mast would add considerable stress to the building's structural frame, as the combined weight of the dirigibles and the force of wind pressure would be transmitted down to the building's foundation. The situation was worsened by the weather, as ""winds were shifting due to violent air currents"" high above the city. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mast the back of the ships would swivel around,"" making a stable connection nearly impossible. And also there was the existing law that air ships cannot fly low in urban areas, which presented a legal barrier to the entire operation. These combined issues of engineering, natural forces, and regulation made the plan ultimately unworkable."
1347	16180	6	3	"According to the excerpt from *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced considerable obstacles in attempting to attach a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. In the text, the author says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" and then describes how the harsh and unpredictable winds at that altitude could render the mast unstable and dangerous. Another obstacle in the making of the mast was a law stating dirigibles could not fly under a certain altitude; the set minimum altitude was higher than the building was tall, legally preventing any docking attempt. The last major obstacle was safety, as the author talks about how some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The potential effect of a blimp fire over a vastly populated urban area would be devastating. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was an ingenious idea, but it ultimately had too many fundamental obstacles to make it a practical or safe reality."
1348	16181	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was primarily one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above the densely populated areas such as downtown New York, leading to catastrophic loss of life. The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast, however, was nature itself. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast due to shifting winds, unlike dirigibles moored in open landing fields which could be weighted down in the back with lead weights. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the mast obsolete from a legal standpoint.
1349	16182	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their plan to dock dirigibles at the skyscraper. There were two main ones: Safety and Nature. The builders should have realized that the idea wasn't safe before building the mast. Most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York would be disastrous. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. There were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, preventing a secure docking. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means it would be illegal to tie a dirigible up to the building, anyway, making the entire venture impractical from the start.
1350	16183	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Their goal was to build a moor on top of the building in order for dirigibles, or blimps, to dock, but in the end they were not successful. One obstacle was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"" on the mast itself, which was too small for such large aircraft. Without this, the dock would not work. Another main obstacle is the safety reason concerning the airships' fuel. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They could easily catch on fire and harm many innocent people below. Which leads to two other reasons, including ""nature itself,"" as the violent winds could easily destabilize a ship and start a fire. There was also the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning the dirigibles could not legally approach the building. With so many obstacles found, this ambitious plan was destined to fail."
1351	16184	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, someone attempted a publicity stunt where they would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The workers mooring equipment had never been installed, putting the workers having to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp in great danger. This precarious situation was exacerbated by the fact that the wind at the top of the building was fierce and unpredictable, which put workers at great risk of falling off, or dying. These practical demonstrations highlighted the inherent dangers of the docking concept, ultimately contributing to its failure as a practical venture for regular airship operations.
1352	16185	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when attempting to let dirigibles dock there. There were several major problems of why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were what was in the dirigibles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships. Dirigibles, unlike balloons which are made up of Helium, are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. This could have resulted in a terrible disaster if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densely populated. Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people on the streets below. Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict then the dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the architects didn't think about before constructing the mooring mast, making the entire plan unfeasible."
1353	16186	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders were in a competition to become the tallest building in the world. This made them rush and really push for this ambitious feature. The architects had to find a way to build this mast, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modification had to be made to the building's framework. They had to fix the framework of the building so the wind wouldn't affect the rest of the structure. The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The builders and architects had to overcome the reality of safety concerns as well. It was not safe and dirigibles are highly flammable. It would be a terrible accident if one eliminated in the city. Also, many laws restricted airships flying low in urban areas. The builders had to face many problems while trying to build the tallest building, and the dirigible docking plan was ultimately one of the most challenging and unrealized aspects of their endeavor.
1354	16187	6	3	The main obstacle was to be the tallest building in the world. That all changed to being able to have a mooring mast so blimps can land on it to drop-off/pick up passengers and refuel. They had sixty thousand dollars in renovations to sturdy the structure of the tower. However, they couldn't make the foundations sturdy enough to hold the weight of an enormous ship plus cargo. The immense size and weight of a fully loaded airship presented an engineering challenge that the existing building design could not safely accommodate. This fundamental structural limitation proved to be a primary reason why the ambitious plan for a functional airship terminal was never successfully realized.
1355	16188	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face, requiring significant structural reinforcement. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Although the mast was finished, due to the forces of Nature and a new law, no dirigibles has ever docked at the Empire State Building, leaving the elegant structure as a monument to an unfulfilled vision."
1356	16189	6	3	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in constructing the mast. The first problem was structural, as the weight of the dirigible tied with a single tether would put great stress on the building. It was said that between the dirigible's load and the wind pressure, the stress would be distributed all the way to the foundation of the building, requiring significant reinforcement. Another obstacle was safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium, which is highly flammable. The owners recalled the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the catastrophic effects it could have had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted violently at the top of the building. The problem discussed was that despite the dirigibles being tied, they could swivel around the mast, posing a control hazard. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commonly used, rendering the ambitious plan impractical."
1357	16190	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the strength of the building's frame, nature, and certain laws against it. A big problem with building a landing for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was the strength of the base, as the immense force exerted by a moored airship threatened the structural integrity. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""(paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to get past was the element of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always changing due to violent air currents, making stable docking nearly impossible. A dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the potential of wrapping around the mast in the unpredictable winds. The workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking. The last obstacle was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas, creating a legal blockade. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (paragraph @NUM2). All of these obstacles proved to be too much for the workers to handle as the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never created for its intended purpose."
1358	16191	6	3	"The Empire State Building is one of the greatest symbols of the United States. With the World Trade Center destroyed, it stands as the city's highest building. Many are familiar with its famous spire at its summit, but few actually know why it's there. The truth is that it was meant to be a mooring dock for dirigibles, or zeppelins, balloons lined with steel that were equipped with propellers for steering. The sad truth is that it never happened. According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"", the environmental conditions as well as safety conditions, were too poor to accommodate such operations. Apparently, the wind currents at such a high altitude are fierce, and if a blimp were to be tethered to the top, quite a great deal of strain would be placed on the building frame, a significant engineering challenge. This is time-consuming and costly to fix. Also, there would be no practical way to weigh down the balloon without the risk of it falling on civilians below. Not only that, but having airships that low over urban areas was illegal, presenting a final regulatory hurdle. In short, the whole idea was wishful thinking, because it couldn't have happened under the prevailing circumstances."
1359	16192	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it talks about the Hindenburg bursting into flames over New Jersey and how much more dangerous it would have been over a highly-populated area such as New York, highlighting the severe safety risks involved. Furthermore, the structural challenge of supporting a massive, wind-buffeted airship at such a great height presented a formidable engineering problem. The unpredictable and powerful air currents at the skyscraper's summit made stable mooring virtually impossible, as a tethered dirigible could swing dangerously. An existing law that prohibited low-flying airships over cities created an additional legal barrier that could not be overcome. Ultimately, the combination of these significant hurdles meant the visionary plan for a dirigible terminal was never realized.
1360	16193	6	3	During any type of construction, the builders face some type of obstacles, as did the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building is the high flammability they possess. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse and devastating. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it, creating an uncontrollable hazard. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas, like New York, which legally forbade the practice. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be, and the mast served only as a structural spire.
1361	16194	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders who tried to make it possible for dirigibles or ""blimps"" to tie up to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building faced some problems they didn't account for. These were variations of blimps they didn't plan for, significant safety issues, and also laws they would have to violate to have a dirigible land. The builders, when making the mast, didn't think deeply about any of these things. The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start, the differences in blimps between countries was a primary factor, because blimps in the United States used inert helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they often used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they couldn't control was nature; the high, unpredictable winds atop the building would violently move the back of the blimp around, and also when landing, a sudden gust could push the blimp into the mast which would easily puncture the gas dome. Both these safety reasons were precisely why blimps are traditionally landed on the ground. However, even without both of these reasons, there was a definitive legal issue, a specific law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it explicitly illegal to dock on the building. Having not considered all these things, the builders put up the mast, but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, the safety issues, and the legal troubles they didn't account for, rendering the project impractical."
1362	16195	6	3	The Empire State Building was constructed to compete with the Chrysler Building, and to compete they created a distinctive mooring mast for airships. The obstacles that restricted the dirigibles from using it were substantial and multifaceted. First was nature; the wind changes on top of the building were drastic and unpredictable, creating a hazardous environment for a large, lightweight aircraft. Furthermore, some dirigibles, particularly those from other nations, were filled with a large amount of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed an immense risk over a city. Another compelling reason why the plan failed was because it's illegal for aircraft to fly low over densely populated urban areas, making such a docking maneuver unlawful. The examples above were all critical complications that ultimately restricted the dirigibles from ever being able to moor successfully at the Empire State Building, leaving the mast as a monument to an unrealized ambition.
1363	16196	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the challenges of creating a mooring mast on top of a 1,250-foot tall building are discussed. In the late 1920s, Al Smith, the governor at the time, had the ambitious idea of making the Empire State Building equipped with its own landing dock for dirigibles. Throughout the process, the builders were faced with many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The first obstacle was the structural challenge of getting the mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" If the builders did do that, it would cause too much stress to the building's framework. This initial problem was solved after spending over a million dollars on a massive steel frame to support the mast's weight. However, most of the builders' subsequent problems were not able to be solved. Safety was a major issue; most foreign dirigibles were built with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. It would be a huge problem if a fire occurred over a densely populated area like Manhattan. Also, the dirigibles would be too high up to be properly tied down and secured. Furthermore, if the dirigibles did land there, it would be in direct violation of an existing law prohibiting low-flying airships over cities. Therefore, the builders were faced with so many insurmountable obstacles they were unable to make the mast functional."
1364	16197	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building face significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was public safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the Hindenburg crash, authorities were more wary, fearing what would happen if a similar disaster occurred in a densely populated area like New York City. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature itself; with the vicious winds at that altitude, simply getting tied up or releasing passengers would be hard enough and incredibly dangerous. According to the article, lead weights were traditionally used to land dirigibles in open land during crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them atop the skyscraper, so there was no chance of a weight falling and hitting someone below. Through all this trouble, the builders still had the most practical problem; a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue, it was explicitly illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through the process of looking at these formidable obstacles just for the thought of what might have been."
1365	16198	6	3	"The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, drove him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task which lay ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects knew they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced was how to adjust the frame of the building to support the heavy docking site. The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They were able to overcome this initial structural obstacle but many more, greater challenges loomed up ahead. The wind and weather needed to be taken into consideration as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"" making a stable connection nearly impossible. Reluctantly, the builders admitted to the inevitable and uncontrollable obstacle posed by nature. At this point, the builders seemed to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more critical obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock concept to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densely populated city was an all-around dangerous idea. It was noted that hydrogen was highly flammable and a fire in the air would be detrimental to both the building and the city below. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this final barrier. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The sheer impossibility of the plan was finally realized, for there were too many obstacles to face. The builders gave up hope, but the mooring mast still looms atop the Empire State Building as a permanent reminder of what could have been."
1366	16199	6	3	The early 1930s was a time where everyone was out to find and build the next best thing. In New York City, two tycoons were competing to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man creating the Empire State building, had an idea to make his building taller and more popular; build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though a good and creative idea, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be more than they bargained for. First off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was very unpractible without changing the whole design. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, as noted in historical records. Also, the dirigible would put so much stress on the foundation of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, posing a significant structural challenge. Nature was also a giant obstacle these architects faced while building this. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, primarily the powerful and unpredictable winds at that altitude. As you can see, these architects faced many challenges while building this mast, that sadly never paid off in the end, rendering the ambitious feature entirely impractical.
1367	16200	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. The government people in Washington was thinking about some safe way of mooring airships to the mast, but they were concerned about the inherent risks. He never wanted to reach the top cause he didn't want an accident to happen and then something tragic occur, reflecting a deep-seated fear of catastrophe. The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making any stable connection nearly impossible. The weight of the build, it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, meant it was neither practical nor safe for the public below. It was also a law that prohibited such risky maneuvers over urban areas, adding a legal barrier to the physical ones. Ultimately, the combination of environmental dangers, safety concerns, and regulatory restrictions made the entire concept unworkable from the start.
1368	16201	6	3	In order to dock these dirigibles, the builders would face many serious problems. These problems in which builders would be forced to deal with involved the building's structure, its city location, and the natural environment. First off, the building frame was too weak to be tied to a dirigible. This is because it would add stress to the frame which could be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, threatening its structural integrity. Due to this they would be forced to spend over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the frame, a significant and unforeseen cost. A second issue they were faced with is that it is in a city. Laws had prohibited flying too low over urban areas, let alone tie up to the building, creating a major legal hurdle. Due to this fact, they would be forced to design a way for it to dock that complied with regulations, which proved difficult. Finally, violent air currents would cause more issues. The builders would have to deal with building a piece of mooring equipment that could withstand the wrath of nature itself, a formidable and unpredictable opponent. All in all, this plan would force many issues on the builders, in order to function, highlighting the immense difficulties of integrating airships with skyscraper design.
1369	16202	6	3	Right from the start, the Empire State Building had architectural demands that posed several obstacles for the builders of it, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for dirigibles. Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it, requiring costly reinforcements. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below, presenting an unacceptable public safety risk. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing, making a safe dock nearly impossible. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building's mast, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons, remaining an iconic but ultimately failed experiment.
1370	16203	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to make a mooring mast for dirigibles. The first obstacle was creating the mooring mast itself. Contemporary sources say, ""This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships."" The Empire State Building's frame wasn't strong enough for the mooring mast, so the builders had to modify it. It was noted that, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" which involved significant additional engineering. An obstacle that stopped the use of the mooring mast was the wind. In one instance, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds, demonstrating a persistent operational challenge. Another obstacle they faced was safety. It was described that, ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" creating a constant danger of fire and explosion. There are problems that the builders could fix and couldn't fix, and in the end, the fundamental issues of wind and safety proved insurmountable, dooming the dirigible mast to failure."
1371	16204	6	3	The builders faced some significant problems such as adverse weather conditions. The winds were violent from changing wind currents, creating a hazardous environment for docking. Another was the legal restriction of how close an aircraft could be to a building, which limited operational flexibility. Another problem was the building had to be strong enough to hold a blimp in place, requiring considerable reinforcement. The builders would have to strengthen the building's skeleton in order for it to work, which they successfully did. Another problem is some foreign Blimps are made with hydrogen, which makes them highly flammable, unlike others made of helium. The hydrogen could catch fire and fall onto pedestrians below, posing a severe public safety risk. These are the primary problems they faced in their ambitious endeavor.
1372	16205	6	3	Some of the obstacles that the builders faced while allowing dirigibles to dock there would be that they had a lack of suitable landing area, which was a fundamental spatial challenge. One of the main obstacles that occurred would be nature, presenting unpredictable forces. The shifting of the air currents were constantly shifting, making stable mooring nearly impossible. The back of the ship was constantly shifting as a result, preventing a secure and safe connection to the mast. These natural and physical limitations proved to be major impediments to the project's success.
1373	16206	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building made it possible for dirigibles to dock on the top of the building because it made the building a lot bigger than it was, adding a distinctive functional mast. It lost its position as the biggest and then got it back by creating the dock for dirigibles, commonly known as blimps, which was an innovative feature intended to reclaim its status. This addition was a strategic move to enhance the building's prestige and utility, marking a unique chapter in its architectural history. Ultimately, this visionary concept aimed to solidify the skyscraper's legendary place in the New York City skyline.
1374	16207	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant problems trying to dock the dirigibles. One big obstacle is that the dirigibles were a safety hazard. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area, many people could have been killed. Another issue was nature, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around, making it unsafe and difficult to control. The builders faced many obstacles and unfortunately could never successfully dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building, rendering the mast an ultimately unused feature."
1375	16208	6	3	"In the building of the mast that was to be used to dock and refuel dirigibles, the builders and architect William Lamb faced many daunting problems. For one thing, a simple mooring mast could not be placed on the roof of the Empire State Building without significant structural consideration. The mast would add too much stress to the building's framework and cause it to collapse, along with having to withstand immense wind power. Another problem was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium to inflate there dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was also a law that stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, adding a regulatory hurdle. One of the final and most important reasons builders faced obstacles was the constantly shifting wind due to violent air currents. Even with the dirigibles tethered to the mooring mast, the back end would swivel around the mast along with the wind, creating an uncontrollable and dangerous situation that ultimately prevented the mast's practical use."
1376	16209	6	3	There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary issue was the immense stress the dirigible would add to the building's structure, requiring over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to the building's framework to reinforce it. Also, most dirigibles at the time contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable and dangerous, posing a significant fire risk. Another dangerous aspect was that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above the city's pedestrians, as opposed to their much safer usual landing in open fields where there was ample space. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause significant legal docking issues and ultimately contributed to the plan's failure.
1377	16210	6	3	The biggest obstacle was safety. The foreign dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a means to fly, but hydrogen gas is highly flammable and volatile. The owners of the Empire State Building were particularly concerned because of what happened to the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, over Lakehurst. The Hindenburg burst into flames and in less than one minute there was no dirigible, just some charred scrap metal, demonstrating the catastrophic potential of such a disaster. If this incident were to happen in a highly populated area like downtown New York City, it would create a high number of casualties and fatalities, a risk that was simply too great to justify the venture.
1378	16211	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because of ""nature itself"" and the past problems that happened. An obstacle that the builders faced was providing safety for the public and the city. After the fiery Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst, the builders were worried about the issues that might occur, especially when it takes place in a densely populated downtown New York. Another obstacle was ""nature itself."" Because of the mooring mast being on top of the building, the builders were frightened because of the violent and unpredictable air currents at that altitude. The last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, so it was illegal for an airship to be tied on a building. The builders faced three main obstacles - ""Nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law. Unfortunately, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong to overcome."
1379	16212	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been completely different from anything before, but the plan never continued because of overwhelming obstacles. The builders faced issues such as critical safety issues, the challenge of harnessing nature, and the law itself. The dirigibles presented safety issues including the risk of fire, which had occurred in the past and made builders realize how much worse that accident could have been in an urban center. Another safety issue was keeping the blimps stabilized, which would have needed free hanging weights over the city streets. Yet another obstacle was the raw power of nature; it would have been nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place due to high winds, which would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. The new idea was a good one but the law also was against it, because of how low the blimp would need to fly. As stated, this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The masting moor of the Empire State Building caused too many obstacles for the project to be completed, and although it would have opened new doors for means of travel, there were too many safety violations for it to be worthwhile.
1380	16213	6	3	"While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State building, the builders had some significant problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were often too strong and turbulent to fly a dirigible in safely; one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers,"" indicating the constant vigilance required. Flying so close to buildings in a dirigible was also illegal, primarily for fear of crashing into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area. The only way proposed to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently in the wind was to put large lead weights on it, but that solution would not be practical or safe over a crowded city like New York. In conclusion, docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was too difficult and dangerous, and it never happened as a result."
1381	16214	6	3	The builders encountered many obstacles while constructing the Empire State Building. They faced intense competition with the Chrysler Building over achieving the greatest height. Al Smith, the former governor who led the construction consortium, was determined to build the tallest and most famous building in the world. He promoted the building relentlessly, making it seem invincible to the public. He even had a mooring mast installed at its pinnacle so that airships could theoretically land on it. However, this mast was never supposed to serve that practical purpose; it was primarily created as a publicity stunt to generate excitement and secure the height record. Because of the attention garnered by the mooring mast, the building succeeded in becoming a popular icon. Al Smith did everything in his power to make that building what it is today, and it remains standing as a celebrated landmark in New York City.
1382	16215	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there. One significant challenge was the immense weight of a zeppelin; when tied down to the building, it would have put immense pressure on the steel framework, and this structural stress would have even reached the very foundation. The cost of reworking and reinforcing the frame to make it safer for such an operation would have been prohibitively expensive. Another major obstacle was managing public expectations. The building was marketed as a revolutionary transport hub that was supposed to change how we travel forever, all while being a beautiful, magnificent structure. Surely the intense pressure to build the tallest tower in the world influenced these ambitious claims. These public expectations were ultimately unrealistic because most people didn't know enough about the engineering complexities to understand the severe safety risks involved.
1383	16216	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were not easy to overcome. They first had to meticulously draw out the plans for the specialized mooring mast. The builders had to consider the immense scale of a thousand-foot dirigible that would be mooring at the top of the skyscraper. They had to calculate the effects of wind pressure and the dynamic load of the massive airship pulling at the structure. To address these challenges, the builders had to come up with brilliant engineering ideas. One of these ideas was the construction of ""a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" on top of the building. Furthermore, builders had to design and install a system of elevators and stairs to transport the passengers of the dirigible down from the mast to the eighty-sixth floor, which was planned with facilities for baggage and tickets. The passengers would have to descend from the one hundred second floor where the mast was located. The builders had a hard job because they had to conceive of how to build the mooring mast itself and also how to safely bring the passengers in and out of the dirigible. These were the significant obstacles the builders faced as the construction of the building progressed."
1384	16217	6	3	"The Empire State Building, at the time it was being built, was designed from the outset to be the tallest building in the world. However, this was not an easy task to accomplish. The workers had one especially difficult obstacle to overcome: enabling dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The ambitious plan was to build a distinctive mooring mast on top of the building which would allow these airships to dock. If this could be achieved, it was said the Empire State Building would be ""equipped for an age of transportation..."" However, many complex problems occurred during the planning. The dirigible's substantial weight would have to be able to be held safely by the structure. The architects correctly knew this weight would put tremendous stress on the building's steel frame. Consequently, the workers had to modify and significantly strengthen the building's framework to bear the load. The workers also built the mast itself out of a strong, shiny, chrome-nickel steel alloy. Another obstacle was faced when the mast's construction was taken into consideration; the main structural framework was originally stopped at the eighty-fifth floor, so the workers had to finish the roof structure before the mast could be framed and erected. Although the workers succeeded in making a safe and structurally sound mast, the grand ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" of regular dirigible service never came to be."
1385	16218	6	3	"Al Smith saw a unique opportunity for his Empire State Building to revolutionize air travel. He wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building so that dirigibles could anchor there for refueling or service and let people on and off. In order to achieve this vision, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This required a significant financial investment, spending over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the framework alone. Builders had to extend the structure to 102 floors and also create a glassed-in observation area along with an open observation platform. Furthermore, they had to complete the roof construction and then move on to building the towering steel mast with its distinctive glass windows. After all that time and money was spent in re-creating the building's design, the plan for dirigibles to dock there ultimately failed. The wind currents at that altitude were so strong and unpredictable that the back of the airship would always be moving, making a safe, stable docking impossible. Also, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over densely populated urban areas. The ambitious venture proved impractical and wasn't worth the immense effort in the end."
1386	16219	6	3	"Due to several factors, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in its attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One serious obstacle was structural, as a dirigible moored at the top of the building, held only by a tether, would place immense stress on the building's frame. In paragraph nine it says ""the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" This financial and structural requirement was a significant initial barrier. Another complication was nature itself. Above the city were strong winds which were constantly shifting due to turbulent air currents. This unpredictable and powerful weather made it virtually impossible to dock a large, buoyant aircraft safely. As well as nature working against the mooring mast, so was the law. In paragraph fifteen it says ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made it illegal for an airship to ever tie up to the Empire State Building, presenting a final, insurmountable legal obstacle to the plan."
1387	16220	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in its plan to serve as a dock for dirigibles. As indicated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This structural strain was one of the many troubles associated with dirigibles landing on the skyscraper. In paragraph @NUM2, They @CAPS1 to realize that the mooring mast of the @ORGANIZATION1n't have been built, because it wouldn't work."" The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfil its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. A primary reason the mooring mast was impractical was because of nature. As you will see on paragraph @NUM3, ""the Winds were shifting due to violent air currents."" These powerful gusts made stable docking a dangerous and unfeasible endeavor. The mooring mast had a lot of problems since the beginning when Al Smith put a top to the building making it 1,250 feet. It was unsafe for planes and for the large airships they intended to host. Dirigibles that came from other countries often used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, adding a severe safety risk. The problem that worked against the mooring mast being used was the wind on top of the building @CAPS2, because of the unpredictable air currents. These are the fundamental reasons why the mooring mast was unsuccessful on the Empire State Building."
1388	16221	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were considerable. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would have stressed the building's frame."" The immense force exerted by a docked airship was a critical engineering challenge. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This requirement meant that the entire structural integrity of the skyscraper would be tested by the constant and variable forces of a tethered dirigible. @CAPS1 are the main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, highlighting the fundamental incompatibility between the massive airships and the skyscraper's design."
1389	16222	6	3	When the Empire State Building was built, new and ambitious ideas came into the heads of the architects. Unfortunately, the vision that they had of making it into @NUM1 dock for blimps proved to be unrealistic. The first challenge that they came across was structural, specifically how to attach a dock for a blimp to the building without creating dangerous stress to the building's framework. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight and wind force unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was made, representing a major financial and engineering hurdle. Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong and turbulent that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely, making the operation extremely hazardous. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was legal; there were laws against aircraft flying that low over urban areas. It was actually considered illegal to dock the blimp there because it would have to be flying low enough to approach the building, violating aviation regulations. Due to these combined structural, natural, and legal factors, the Empire State Building was ultimately unable to become a dock to support blimps.
1390	16223	6	3	From my reading, I understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock atop such a structure as the Empire State Building were numerous. An obvious one was ensuring structural stability throughout the entire building. Paraphrased from the passage, the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause significant stress on the building's frame, requiring substantial reinforcement to handle the load. Another major difficulty was the controll of the dirigible during the docking maneuver. The passage explained that the winds above the Empire State Building would shift violently and frequently, creating an unstable and dangerous environment for navigating a large, lightweight airship. Safety was a critical issue as well, especially after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, when a German zeppelin caught fire and exploded, highlighting the catastrophic risks associated with hydrogen-filled airships operating near a populated urban center. These combined challenges of engineering, weather, and public safety ultimately rendered the mooring mast concept impractical.
1391	16224	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building were building a mast, dirigibles docking on top of the building, and a law for dirigibles. The architects and builders spent a lot of time and resources constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, a complex and ambitious feat of engineering. Dirigibles were trying to figure out how to dock to the building, yet most dirigibles failed due to the unpredictable wind currents at such a great height. Furthermore, a law prohibited dirigibles from docking in urban areas in case of a problem within the dirigibles, such as a fire or a gas leak, which presented a final, insurmountable legal barrier. These were the significant obstacles the builders faced in their attempt to create a mast and allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building.
1392	16225	6	3	"The obstacles the builders faced while constructing the Empire State Building were safety and time. The safety of building the top of the Empire State Building was a major concern because it was so tall that it would be hard to lift up the heavy glass and steel parts to the top using the equipment available. Another reason why it was unsafe was the risk that if some of the glass or steel part got pushed off, it could fall on the people down below. Another safety issue involved the blimps flying too close to the building and potentially hitting it. Also, for the passengers going on and off of the blimp, they needed to find a way that the passengers wouldn't get hurt during the transfer at such a dizzying altitude. The time that they had to build the top of the Empire State Building was also not long enough, adding pressure to an already dangerous task, as suggested by the contemporary quote, ""it's on the level, all right. No Kidding. We're working on the thing now."" Ultimately, these safety and scheduling challenges were defining hurdles in the construction process."
1393	16226	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had a real hard time with the construction of the mooring mast itself. They had to deal with the fundamental framework of the building, which was not originally designed for this purpose. A big obstacle they had was that they didn't have a suitable landing area for the large dirigibles. They didn't just have to deal with man-made obstacles, but nature's obstacles as well. The powerful wind on the top of the building made it nearly impossible for a large, lightweight airship to land safely. As one source notes, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The constructors of the building realized that to make this plan possible they would have to significantly redo the frame of the building. The workers were initially blind to see all the possible problems with the design of the mooring mast. The numerous obstacles the workers had to go through were too much, and the planned landing of the dirigibles never successfully worked."
1394	16227	6	3	"To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, builders would have to face tough obstacles. One obstacle would be that technology was rapidly growing in the 1930's, and by the time they were working on the mooring mast, airplanes were becoming more popular and invented. A document states, ""the as yet unsolved problem of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it Desirable to Postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" This quote proves that they already had some technology to land dirigibles safely but needed to conduct tests to see if the mast really worked. This suggests that the necessary technology was not yet fully perfected, even as it was being developed faster than the builders could implement the mast at the top of the Empire State Building. Later on they figured that a dirigible would be unsafe at the top of a mast because the strong wind would blow it around and cause it to crash into the building. It was an impractical and dangerous idea to begin with, leading to its ultimate failure."
1395	16228	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders had to face was when they were building the mooring mast to hold the dirigibles. The single cable tether that would hold the massive dirigibles would add tremendous stress to the building's structural frame. The builders had to come up with a new engineering idea that would not put dangerous stress on the building. Another obstacle the builders had to face was ensuring it would be safe for the passengers. Since the building is so high up, the fear of falling out of the dirigible or during the boarding process made them worry about passenger security. One last obstacle that the builders had to face is the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, creating a legal blockade. The builders faced these many significant obstacles while building the mooring mast, which ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a reality."
1396	16229	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The first obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified to handle the immense strain. The excerpt says, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle was safety, which became a paramount concern after the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire; builders realized how bad the devastation would be if that happened over densely populated New York City. Nature was also a large obstacle, as shifting air currents at the top of the building would make the dirigible very unstable. It would be dangerous to have an unstable dirigible hanging above crowded city streets. Finally, at the time there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which presented a legal barrier. These obstacles ultimately prevented the architects of the Empire State Building from successfully implementing their plan to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1397	16230	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by one single cable tether, would add tremendous stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, to the building's foundation. This in turn meant that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the Empire State Building in order for it to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made to reinforce the structure. As construction proceeded, once the framing had been complete up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place, adding complexity to the construction timeline. These structural and logistical challenges proved to be major impediments to the dirigible docking plan.
1398	16231	6	3	"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature and the law. One of the greatest obstacle was safety. Since blimps needed to be lighter than air, most are filled with helium or hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a big obstacle because if the blimp is high off the ground of New York City and then catches on fire, that could end badly for everyone below. Another obstacle was nature; due to violent air currents which made buildings sway. This is also bad because if the blimp moves or the building sways into the building than one or the other could break, causing a catastrophic accident. The last obstacle was the law, which was against 'airships flying too low over urban areas'. So if they did build the mast, it would be even illegal to get a dirigible close enough to use it. So those are some of the key obstacles builders faced in building the Empire State building to dock blimps, making the venture impractical."
1399	16232	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders went through in trying to dock the dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. One to be exact would be the wind, although they would be tying the dirigible down the back was not and the wind would blow the massive airship around. Which would affect the building's structural integrity. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" With this discovery they had to make some significant structural changes to the building, which would cost them more money and time. Other obstacles they went through were actually being able to have it dock, because it's a law that you can't do that with some of the people below being at risk. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These are just a few of the obstacles that the architects went through out trying to dock dirigibles, highlighting the project's inherent difficulties."
1400	16233	6	3	First of all the Empire State Building wasn't originally made for landing dirigibles on top of it. The architects had to redesign the whole top of the building to incorporate a mooring mast. When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles, which was a critical oversight. It was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear and handling equipment. The dirigible is over seven hundred feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible. The sheer size of the airship combined with the inadequate preparations made the entire concept a hazardous proposition from the start.
1401	16234	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A primary problem they faced was having to build the mooring mast because without it the dirigible would add significant stress to the building's frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings Frame."" This structural concern required a specialized mast to distribute the forces. Even though the builders made the mooring mast, it was ultimately too unsafe to moor dirigibles from the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" The risk of a fire from a hydrogen-filled airship was simply too great to proceed. In all, the builders were faced with too many obstacles and could not manage to moor the dirigibles to the building successfully."
1402	16235	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, existing laws, and the changes in air currents. Many of the dirigibles ""from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM1). The owners of the Empire State Building realized that a much worse situation would happen if such a vessel were to catch on fire ""above a densely populated area"" (@NUM1). Another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM3). The airship would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the streets"", which is pretty unsafe (@NUM4). The last obstacle that the builders faced was the shift in air currents on top of the building. If the dirigibles were tied to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around""(@NUM4). This erratic movement could be dangerous for pedestrians on the street, as well as passengers coming on and off the dirigibles. These practical reasons, from fire hazards to legal and environmental factors, called for the idea of the mooring mast to be diminished and ultimately abandoned."
1403	16236	6	3	The obstacles that the Empire State Building faced were a lot, specifically in the modifications needed so that the dirigibles, or blimps, could dock there. One obstacle was building more floors. They had to build more floors so that the people on the dirigibles could have somewhere to load and unload on the ship, creating a functional passenger terminal at a great height. Another obstacle was building steel frames from the 85th floor to the 102nd floor to support this new structure. This costed them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications, that had to be done to the building's framework to handle the additional weight and stress. Despite these significant and costly structural changes, the plan to dock airships was never realized in a practical way.
1404	16237	6	3	"@CAPS2 on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This would cause stress on the building, so the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This required extensive and expensive structural engineering. Another obstacle the architects faced was a concern of safety. In the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 the greatest obstacle was ""nature itself."" On the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. In the excerpt it states, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making a stable and safe docking procedure impossible. @CAPS2 on the excerpt, these are the many obstacles, from engineering to elemental forces, faced by the architects in their ambitious plan."
1405	16238	6	3	The Empire State Building faced many problems in its plan to dock a dirigible. To dock a dirigible, it needed a good and safe dock site, which proved difficult to engineer at such a height. Also, the wind so high up would make it nearly impossible for a dirigible to stay docked securely without being thrown about by violent gusts. Finally, the dirigible would be very hazardous to the people below because it was extremely flammable, posing a catastrophic fire risk over the city. These combined challenges of location, weather, and safety ultimately made the venture impractical.
1406	16239	6	3	"In this fascinating story ""The Mooring Mast"" written by author Marcia Amidon Lusted, the narrative tells about the Empire State building and its enormousity. Although constructing this building took workers considerable time and strength, they didn't exactly grasp the full purpose or the practical challenges of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example, the American dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, which was a safer choice, but many foreign airships still used hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable; so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were customarily moored in open landing fields, so they could be weighted down securely. Author Marcia writes ""but using these at the empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe."" That's how and there's many more reasons why workers had trouble realizing the vision for the building's mooring mast, ultimately leading to its failure as a functional airship dock."
1407	16240	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the Empire State Building faced some significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin with, one of the greatest obstacle was the act of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", this made it exceedingly hard for the large and cumbersome dirigible to have a safer and controlled landing. The other major obstacle was that there was a specific law, that went directly against airships flying low over densely populated urban areas. This regulation presented a legal barrier that was difficult to overcome. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not used for its intended purpose of landing airships such as the dirigible because the entire endeavor was simply too dangerous. In addition, they used the mooring mast for other safe purposes, such as broadcasting antennas, which proved to be a more practical and lasting function for the structure."
1408	16241	6	3	In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a very good idea. They could be the new revolutionary form of transportation and initially appeared to have no major flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed, however, it showed increasing signs of inherent problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of structural stress to the building's frame, which was a serious concern. They next found that passenger safety was a primary issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was highly flamable and posed a great risk. Also they would have to use heavy lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have these lead weights dangling high above pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel uncontrollably in the air with a strong possibility of puncturing its delicate shell. Finally there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building for docking. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros, leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
1409	16242	6	3	"In an attempt to build a dirigible destination in the Empire State Building, the architects had to deal with significant problems like a potential dirigible mishap or simply the forces of nature itself. A catastrophic problem like a blimp crash would be enormously costly, many lives would be lost in the densely populated city and the resulting explosion could destroy buildings around and even damage the Empire State Building itself. To prevent this from happening the Government had already made a law that banned flying aircraft from going to close to urban areas. To build this docking station the architects would have to break laws or bend rules, which was not feasible. Another conflicting idea that disrupted plans for a dirigible docking station would be nature; harsh winds could easily sway a blimp, and this swaying could cause the blimp to punture on a nearby building, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would still swivel around the mooring mast."" The swiveling as mentioned earlier could hit near by building and harm civilians on the streets below. The significant problems and laws that kept the Mast from being created should have been realized before the construction began; the idea will never be possible under such dangerous and illegal circumstances."
1410	16243	6	3	The Empire State building is known as the worlds tallest building of its time. The building is located in the heart of New York. Al Smith, the head of building the Empire State building, added a top or a hat to the building, that made the building be even more distinctive than any other skyscraper in the city. The Empire State building was originally equipped for a novel form of transportation. This new transportation was the dirigible, or zeppelin. The Empire State building had a special mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. A primary obstacle that the Building faced was New York's inherent lack of a suitable open landing area. Al seen an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire state building directly via air. Al seen it as something creative and new for the city. However, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fulfilled as a working airship dock. No serious thought of public safety was thought about before constructing the idea either. The greatest reason was most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium which is a higher risk for flames and a catastrophic explosion. Also nature itself was a big problem with unpredictable winds; the idea had obvious safety problems and couldn't risk flames in Downtown New York, leading to the mast's ultimate failure for its intended purpose.
1411	16244	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders faced was that they had to go to the base of the building to make it taller. This is because the structural integrity of the entire edifice had to be continuously reinforced from its foundation upwards as new floors were added. This process was time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring meticulous work at the building's lowest levels before any new height could be safely achieved. These are the obstacles that they faced.
1412	16245	6	3	Many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The obstacles included the publics safety, regulations that were already put in place, and the unpredictable weather. Many dirigibles use hydrogen gas which is very flammable. After the German Hindenburg went down it became apparent that the publics safety would be in danger from the vessels bursting into flame over crowded streets. At the time there were also regulations forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low, placing any docking maneuver in direct violation of these rules. The final problem was the unpredictable weather. Piolets were worried the strong winds would blow the tethered vessel into another building or into sharp spires that would ruin the vessel and put the people below in danger. Many obstacles hindered the loading dock on the Empire State Building from ever becoming a practical or safe reality.
1413	16246	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were high wind currents, and an already existing law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas. The first reason dirigibles couldn't dock was because of overly powered wind currents on top of the Empire State Building. It was mentioned that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" The point being made was that it would be unsafe for people if the dirigibles were going to dock near the Empire State during violent air currents. The other reason why dirigibles couldn't dock was because of the law saying they were against airships flying to low over urban areas. Essentially, this law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get to close to the area. It was said that dirigibles did try to reach the building. In December 1930 the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Since the dirigible was so big it couldn't get close enough because of sharp objects on other buildings. It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, all because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."
1414	16247	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire buildings flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. Once architects had designed the mooring mast it could be complete and useful. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself, as the high-altitude winds made stable docking maneuvers nearly impossible to execute safely. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building.
1415	16248	6	3	"After planning and building the mooring mast on top of the empire state building, the developers found many problems that were not thought of earlier. They hadn't thought about the flammability of the gases inside of the dirigibles, which posed a significant fire hazard. Nor had they remembered the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building"". Also, the heavy winds that would be found that high above the ground would certainly prove to be a danger to all the airships. If they had hit a neiboring building the results could be disastrous, leading to potential loss of life and property. These unforeseen challenges ultimately prevented the dirigible docking concept from being a feasible reality."
1416	16249	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem the builders faced was that a dirigible being moored to the top of the building would add significant stress to its frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below."" To manage this immense force, the builders had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of structural modifications to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Another major problem they faced was passenger and public safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium."" Hydrogen is extremely flammable and after a tragic incident with a German dirigible being destroyed, they realized how catastrophically dangerous it would be over a densely populated area like New York City. Another reason was the unpredictable forces of nature. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly moving."" This made it exceedingly hard to tie up and keep the massive aircraft steady for passengers to get off safely. Even a skilled navy pilot ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Furthermore, there was even a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, rendering the operation legally problematic. Ultimately, the mooring on top of the Empire State building was destined to fail because of all the insurmountable obstacles that the builders faced."
1417	16250	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders went through numerous obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock in the @ORGANIZATION1. First, the builders had to redesign the very top of the Empire State Building, constructing a distinctive spire. They had to make it taller and more suitable structurally for the dirigibles to land. They went through considerable design problems because they were not sure if the massive airships would fit properly at such a height. Second, the builders had to design the specialized mast itself. This meant the builders had to design a whole other part for the dirigible to connect to, which was a complex engineering challenge. The builders also had to spend a considerable sixty thousand dollars into building and installing the mast, representing a significant financial obstacle. Third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles to ensure durability. This was a further obstacle because they had to incorporate specialized glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel on the tower, which was challenging to fabricate and install at such a scale. The builders went through many obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, when in the end the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock successfully, leading one to agree that the builders should ""Take a bow, because it's over now."""
1418	16251	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, with primary concerns being safety, nature, and existing law. In the excerpt the author tells how many foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, which is very flammable and highly volatile. That makes it profoundly dangerous to dock them on the Empire State Building because they could get in an accident, and since New York City is so densely populated it would probably harm many people on the ground below. People's lives shouldn't be risked just to land a dirigible in the heart of Manhattan. Another significant problem builders faced was the uncontrollable force of nature. In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would mean the large, buoyant dirigible would just be dangling way above New York and winds could get dangerous very fast because it was so unpredictable and powerful at that altitude. According to the excerpt this situation was neither practical nor safe for the aircraft or its passengers. To add to all of these obstacles, builders didn't fully consider an already existing law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas. So that meant it would be essentially illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building, creating a legal barrier. Builders faced so many interconnected obstacles about allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building that the ambitious plan just wasn't meant to be."
1419	16252	6	3	"While builders tried to figure out a way for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, there were some significant obstacles faced from the outset. If a large dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add tremendous stress to the building's structural frame, posing a serious engineering challenge. The dirigible would have to be cabled at the very top which was also difficult because of the Empire State's flat roof design, which was not naturally suited for such an operation. Also, the unpredictable weather was a huge obstacle that could not be engineered away. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) The powerful and shifting wind would cause the dirigible to sway dangerously and not be very stable for passenger disembarkation. Builders had to also keep in mind that using the building in this way could be harmful to pedestrians as well, since the dirigibles would be operating too close to the ground in a crowded urban environment. The complex planning of where these large aircrafts were to land and re-fill with gas was not an easy task for the builders, ultimately proving too difficult to resolve."
1420	16253	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, nature, unsafe docking conditions and pre-existing laws against dirigibles were just a few of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main and most persistent obstacle ""to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". On the top of a building so high, the wind is always switching directions and strength which would cause the large, buoyant dirigible to ""swivel around"" uncontrollably. Blimps or dirigibles had always traditionally landed in open fields and could be easily weighted down with lead weights, but using this technique on a skyscraper ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe"" for anyone below. The builders of the Empire State Building also came across a major legal hurdle in ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". Now this law made it explicitly illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building, creating an insurmountable regulatory barrier. In the final analysis, attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe, practical, nor legal, dooming the venture from the start."
1421	16254	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles they had to face in order to fulfill the vision of a dirigible mooring mast. The Empire State Building is over a thousand feet tall which made for some significant problems. L¸sted stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the Mooring Mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind speed on the top of the Empire State building would be terrible because the Dirigible's tail is basically weightless and it would move around violently which could make the support beams give out, or could put people's life in danger below. L¸sted further emphasized this point by saying, ""But using these at the Empire State Building; where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street is neither practical nor safe."" Another reason as to why the Mooring Mast could not be constructed is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. L¸sted stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" It is not legal for the Dirigible to even be in the vicinity of the building which makes the entire concept impossible to execute. These combined factors of nature, safety, and legality ultimately prevented the ambitious plan from ever becoming a functional reality."
1422	16255	6	3	"The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of making the dream of docking dirigibles into a reality with the Empire State Building's mooring mast. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in the text, ""the greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York would be put in danger by a massive, unstable airship hovering above the city streets. Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating that airships cannot fly too close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans for the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimpse of the future soon turned into nothing as the project's proponents finally confronted the public in saying that the construction would be postponed. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast. The future of transportation took a sharp blow with this failure, but with the new succession of the airplane, anything seemed possible again."
1423	16256	6	3	The Empire State Building was in construction and the builders passed through many obstacles. First, because they wanted to do the biggest building in the world and they had to work hard against tight deadlines and immense logistical challenges. However, the State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose of docking dirigibles, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The fundamental issues of high-altitude winds and the structural integrity required to secure a massive airship were seemingly overlooked in the initial ambition. These critical flaws meant the celebrated mooring mast would never serve its intended function, remaining instead as a testament to a dream that was ultimately unachievable.
1424	16257	6	3	"Despite all hope and anticipation surrounding the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the project was never destined to be a success. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building, adding significant complexity and cost. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring, a problem for which no viable solution was found. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building rather than a functional piece of aviation history."
1425	16258	6	3	Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds, a potentially weak structure, and public safety. The strong winds at such a great height would almost make it impossible to hold a dirigible steady at the top, while concerns over a weak structure would almost make it impossible to hold it safely at the top without risking a catastrophic failure. The sheer size and volatility of an airship, combined with these factors, created an immense hazard. With all of these hazards present, it is completely unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board these massive dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. The inherent dangers involved thus rendered the entire concept impractical from the outset.
1426	16259	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major issue was the immense structural stress a moored airship would impose. For example, a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add considerable stress to the building's frame. The combined stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, requiring substantial reinforcement. The second obstacle was the profound danger of such operations above a city. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, made the building's owners acutely aware of how much worse such an accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Furthermore, the winds at the top of the building presented a third critical challenge. These winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which meant that even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would dangerously swivel around and around the mast. In conclusion, the combination of structural, safety, and environmental obstacles meant the idea of dirigibles docking on the building was hardly feasible.
1427	16260	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon Lusted, informs readers about the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle involved the fundamental structure of the building itself. The issue was that a moored dirigible would add a significant and potentially dangerous amount of stress to the building's frame. To fix this problem, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and strengthened, a costly and complex engineering undertaking. Another obstacle faced by the builders involved the forces of nature. The winds on top of the building were notoriously violent and often shifted directions unpredictably. This hazardous wind shear hindered the ability of any dirigible to safely moor on top of the building and remained an unsolvable problem. The final obstacle was a regulatory restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas, which was implemented for public safety. This official restriction ultimately made it impossible for dirigibles to legally moor on top of the Empire State Building. The excerpt therefore clearly explains the combination of structural and natural obstacles that doomed the plan."
1428	16261	6	3	During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to confront numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these primary obstacles were the need to change the design of the building, the critical need to consider public safety, and the volatile materials the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add immense stress to the building's frame, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened. This required over sixty thousand dollars worth of structural modifications to be spent. Compounding this was the inherent danger of the airships themselves; a dirigible was essentially a steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen or helium. This was a major safety issue, as most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen rather than the safer helium. The tragic destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg by fire made the owners of the Empire State Building realize how catastrophic a similar accident could be if it occurred over downtown New York. During its construction, builders had to navigate these many complex obstacles in their ultimately futile attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1429	16262	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A primary concern was the structural integrity of the skyscraper. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would put tremendous stress on the building's frame. To accommodate this new situation, the steel frame of the building would have to be significantly modified and strengthened. This necessary reinforcement was a costly endeavor, requiring over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. These financial and engineering hurdles were significant obstacles they had to consider and overcome for the plan to proceed, highlighting the immense practical challenges of the proposal.
1430	16263	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their plan to create a dirigible terminal were multifaceted and ultimately insurmountable. Their ambitious vision was to have the skyscraper serve as a central port for passengers on existing transatlantic routes and for new routes that were yet to come, revolutionizing air travel. However, this vision clashed with the practical realities of engineering, public safety, and the unpredictable nature of the weather at such a great height. The immense stress a moored airship would place on the building's structure, the catastrophic fire risk exemplified by the Hindenburg disaster, and the violent, shifting winds at the pinnacle of the tower all conspired against the plan. These formidable obstacles ensured that the dream of a dirigible mast atop the Empire State Building remained just that—a dream.
1431	16264	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some minor obstacles were the frame and strength of the building. Other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled. In paragraph nine the author explains that if a thousand-foot dirigibles were to be moored to the top of the Empire State Building it would add stress to the building's frame. Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen. Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, which created a significant fire hazard. Furthermore, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight, which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians. The last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas, legally preventing the docking procedure. Though the builders of the Empire State building faced these significant obstacles in allowing blimps to dock it still became a well known building in New York City.
1432	16265	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that inside the dirigibles were hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders did not want to risk any lives or damage any buildings. They realized how much worse an accident could be if it took place in down town New York, envisioning a catastrophe similar to the Hindenburg disaster but over a densely populated cityscape. The greatest obstacle was the wind on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to air currents, making it nearly impossible to stabilize an airship. Also dirigibles would be dangling over pedestrians on the streets below, posing a direct danger to the public. The last reason is because their was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for them to tie it up to the building or even approach it, presenting a final legal barrier to the plan.
1433	16266	6	3	"When the architects behind the mooring Mast of the Empire State Building first began there work in designing it, they did not take into account the obstacles that they would have to overcome to dock a dirigible. In the excerpt it States that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building: however the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means that the builders would need to design Some way of doing this when the building was already begun, a significant engineering challenge. Other obstacles included those of safety. The exerpt tells that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen"" which is more flammable than helium. This combined with the fact that there really was no way of securing the tale of a dirigible moored at the mast could cause an accident similar to that of the Hindenburg over a ""densely populated area Such as downtown New York"", a risk the builders were unwilling to take."
1434	16267	6	3	"Based on the excerpt It shows in some way's there were obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles or Blimps to dock there. One of those examles were found in paragraph nine. It said ""The mooring mast of the empire State building was designed to never fulfill its purpose."" Another One was Also in paragraph nine when they said ""The greatest reason was one of safty: Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in lakehurst, New, Jersey, the owners of the empire state building relized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated Area such as downtown New York. Also in paragraph fourteen it says that nature was a big obsticle for the success of the mooring mast. The winds on the tops of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another reason was because of existing laws was airships flying too low over populated or urban areas, which legally prohibited the entire concept."
1435	16268	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted There were important obstacles The builders of the Empire State Building faced for the dirigibles to dock and becomes stationary there. The dirigible was highly flammable, struchure was unsafe laws and it was never prmitting for them to dock There.One, The dirigibles are highly flammable to have have near a building that has so much importance to its city. ""Today These dirigibles are camo. fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to have lighter in the air."" These dirigibles in the U.S only have hydrogen which is the ultimate firestarter, creating a severe safety hazard. Second, the structure never passed for a human passenger to get on The structure and ride The blimp. The law states ""aircraft flying low to urban areas is illegal."" This is why it never could happen. Third, weather can never always be right twenty-four seven. The problem is ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting violent air currents."" This Put lives in danger, these were obstacles in The dirigibles docking and ultimately prevented the plan from ever being realized."
1436	16269	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A mooring mast, intended for docking dirigibles, would add significant stress to the building's frame and ""could not simply be dropped atop the Empire State Building."" The building needed to be extensively ""modified and strengthened"" to accommodate this situation, requiring substantial engineering changes. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Owners of the building realized if an accident like the Hindenburg disaster were to take place above a densely populated city or area such as downtown New York, the results would have been far worse, causing catastrophic loss of life. The builders' greatest obstacle would be nature itself. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making stable docking nearly impossible. Even if the airship could tether to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. In addition, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, dirigibles could not legally moor at the Empire State Building. For these combined reasons, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" remaining an ambitious but impractical feature."
1437	16270	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the structural cost; in order to build it for docking dirigibles, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications, which had to be made to the building's framework to handle the additional load. Also, another significant obstacle was safety. Dirigibles were not that safe, as they were highly flammable and would be operating over an area with many other buildings and people around, posing a severe fire risk. These are a few of the primary obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their ultimately unsuccessful attempt to allow the docking of dirigibles at the skyscraper's summit."
1438	16271	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A first obstacle the builders faced was the concern of the building collapsing over time with ""all the weight of the dirigibles."" They would have to spend more money and time to create a reinforced frame for the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles, as a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add considerable stress to the building's frame. A second obstacle builders came upon was the safety concerns for the thousands of citizens just below the tall building. After a German dirigible caught fire in New Jersey, they realized how serious the situation could become. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" These were two of the key obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their ambitious plan."
1439	16272	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles being structural stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, held only by a single cable tether, it adds immense stress to the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was public safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flammable, creating a major hazard. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast on repeat because violent air currents would constantly be shifting the winds on the top of the building. There would be no stable solution, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast. These are the primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1440	16273	6	3	When the Empire State Building was faced with adding a dirigible docking station they encountered many problems. The first issue the planners encountered was the wind. The wind over a thousand feet in the air is never going to be calm or predictable. Once they got the dirigible tethered to the tower there would be no way they could keep it still enough to safely refuel and let passengers on or off the dirigible. The Second problem they ran into was that the gas used for lift, hydrogen, is highly flammable. If somehow that hydrogen caught fire it would be a disaster in such a place as downtown New York. The third and final reason is it is illegal to have an aircraft that low in a city, violating existing aviation laws. There was no way this ambitious plan was going to work out, so they stopped moving forward on this project entirely.
1441	16274	6	3	"The Empire State Building spire was originally built to be more than just visibly stimulating; it was conceived as a functional mooring mast for docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were thought to be the transportation of the future, but the mast had many obstacles it had to overcome. Al Smith saw an opportunity to place the Empire State Building and all of New York at the forefront of modern travel. The mast would have to support and withstand a dirigible's weight, so ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The constant threat of wind made the plans too dangerous as well, since ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Finally, most dirigibles were highly flammable and couldn't be safely docked without endangering the public. A disaster like that would have been much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Ultimately, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building involved too many significant challenges to be practical."
1442	16275	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by T. J. Shields, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues included safety, nature, and an existing law. Safety was the greatest obstacle, as these dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Furthermore, the buildings in downtown New York stand so close together that one building, such as the Empire State Building, catching on fire could have devastating effects. The hardest problem to overcome would have been nature, because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It would have been impossible to keep the back of a dirigible from swiveling around. Also, the dirigibles would be hanging high above cars and people on the streets below, posing a constant risk. The last reason the dirigibles should not be moored at the Empire State Building was because of a law that prohibited ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made the entire plan illegal, and although it was a visionary idea, it was ultimately not well thought out."
1443	16276	6	3	The builders faced many problems trying to allow the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The biggest obstacle they had was the wind. At that elevation, the air was constantly shifting due to violent currents. If the dirigible was tethered, the back end would swivel uncontrollably. Another significant problem was that they could not effectively weigh it down for stability. Since it was elevated so high above the ground, if the dirigible was weighted down it would risk a catastrophic fall. These are some of the primary obstacles the builders faced, which ultimately made the plan unfeasible.
1444	16277	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area, requiring them to design a specialized mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was that a dirigible would be held by a single cable tether, and that would add immense stress to the building's frame. To address this, New York City would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. Then the greatest reason of safety came upon them. That was, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized if that happened over New York, it would cause a problem of immense proportions. The final and greatest obstacle they faced to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as the violent wind and air currents would make it exceedingly hard to tether the dirigibles securely. In conclusion, those were the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there."
1445	16278	6	3	"There were several major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" This required costly reinforcement, costing over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications necessary. Also, the ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place,"" creating a complex construction sequence. However, they did not solve several other critical obstacles. Foreign dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" and this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivel around the mast uncontrollably. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which presented a legal barrier. In the end, there were simply too many obstacles, so the dirigible docking plan was ultimately scrapped."
1446	16279	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles that had to be faced was dealing with the hydrogen from dirigibles outside of the United States. The hydrogen was very flammable and they would not be able to stand a fire in such a highly populated area, risking a catastrophic disaster. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating an unstable and unpredictable environment. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast, making a secure connection nearly impossible. The powerful winds from nature would make it hard to control the massive airship, so people were justifiably afraid of the dirigible crashing into the building itself. Those were some of the significant obstacles that were faced in this ambitious endeavor.
1447	16280	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey, it would have been even more dangerous over a densely populated area like New York where the Empire State Building was located. However, the greatest obstacle to the success of the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to powerful and unpredictable air currents. Dirigibles would not be safe dangling high above pedestrians on the street, posing a constant threat. The major problem the architects faced was that dirigibles could not legally moor at the Empire State Building because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Even though it seemed like a good and futuristic idea at the time, the plan was ultimately not practical or safe for the city and its inhabitants.
1448	16281	6	3	"Obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were not easy to overcome. Most dirigibles were massive, as noted in this quote dealing with them was no easy task: ""as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York."" This quote tells of their massive size and proves how difficult it would be to control and land them safely in an urban environment. Another obstacle the workers had to face is modifying the already set structure of the Empire State Building, also involving significant money spent as stated in this quote: ""The Steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This quote proves that the addition of the mooring mast would be not only tiring for the workers, but also a lot of money would be spent on what ultimately became a failed project. They got their tall building, but were unable to achieve a functioning dirigible mooring mast."
1449	16282	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their plan to dock dirigibles. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making any stable connection perilous. This natural challenge was compounded by the fact that the dirigibles were enormous and difficult to maneuver in such conditions. Also, because the Empire State Building was subject to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, the entire concept faced a legal barrier from the outset. These combined issues of natural forces and legal restrictions presented formidable challenges that ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a reality.
1450	16283	6	3	The builders were constructing a mooring mast about one thousand feet high above the surface, so safety was a primary issue. Then a two-hundred-foot airship would moor at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether which would add significant stress to the building's structure (the airship's load would). Also, the immense wind pressure on the massive airship would have to be transmitted over a thousand feet below to the foundation. So it's a structural concern that could affect the entire building's integrity. The airship, filled with flammable hydrogen, could catch on fire on top of downtown New York, potentially hurting thousands of people. And it was costing a lot of money, over sixty thousand dollars, for a project that proved to be unfeasible and dangerous.
1451	16284	6	3	Allowing the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building took some obstacles. First, there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all, presenting a significant hazard that contributed to the plan's ultimate impracticality.
1452	16285	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the New York streets. One of their many problems was the sheer size of the dirigibles, somewhere as long as one-thousand feet, which made maneuvering them in an urban environment exceptionally difficult. Another problem they faced was keeping the back of the ship from swiveling around the mooring mast. Usually, the backs of these blimp-like structure's were anchored down by lead weights, but to have lead weights dangling high above the streets was way to risky not to mention unpractical, as a single mishap could have tragic consequences for the city below.
1453	16286	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that they needed a mooring mast so that the dirigibles could anchor, but they couldn't drop a mooring mast on the flat surface of the Empire State Building's roof. It would put too much stress to the building. This problem cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle was safety precautions. The dirigibles were mostly filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible was to catch on fire, then the whole Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone in it. It also wasn't safe because strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, causing danger to pedestrians below. One other obstacle that the builders faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If they tried to anchor a dirigible on the Empire State Building, it would be illegal. Due to all of these obstacles not getting results, the whole idea has disappeared from serious consideration.
1454	16287	6	3	"The architects, engineers, and workers or the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to attach a dirigible dock the top of the building. The first troubling encounter for the builders was they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building."" The engineers and architects needed to make sixty thousand dollars worth of repairs to strengthen the buildings frame work. Mother nature herself was also a problem. The constantly shifting winds would make it hard to stay landed unless they were weighed down. Even weighing down the zeppelins proposed a threat of a weight falling and killing an innocent person. Lastly a law prevented dirigibles from flying to low over a city. If a spike from another building hit and popped the ballon, there would be an absolute disaster. Overall there were many obstacles preventing the idea of a dirigible dock to ever become true, sealing its fate as a fascinating but unworkable concept."
1455	16288	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders faced quite a few problems. They faced challenges on constructing the building itself. They didn't know if they could built it all, given the unprecedented height and the novel purpose of the mooring mast. They also faced a bad climate, with high-altitude winds posing a constant threat to any docking maneuver. Furthermore, they faced the issue of how much the dirigibles weighted and if the structure can hold it. On paragraph fourteen it says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights,"" a solution that was not feasible for a skyscraper in the heart of the city. These are a few things that the workers had to face, illustrating the immense difficulties of the project."
1456	16289	6	3	The obstacles he had was that the problems where never really solved and that had caused problems with the wind, which constantly buffeted the structure and made any potential docking operation perilous. The unresolved issues created a cycle of complications, ultimately proving that the initial concept was fundamentally flawed from the start.
1457	16290	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend a significant sum to modify the building's framework, I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with that money. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building, rendering the entire concept impractical from a legal standpoint. Overall, the idea of the mooring mast was just a very poorly planned the idea, doomed to failure by a combination of safety, weather, and regulatory hurdles.
1458	16291	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the builders had to fix the frame of the building in order to transmit the stress of the dirigible to the bottom of the building, which required substantial reinforcement. Another obstacle the builders faced was the team had to complete the roof before the framing of the mooring mast could take place, creating a strict and sequential construction timeline. The architects of the Empire State Building also had to make sure that the mast's skeleton was made out of steel so that the mast looked like the rest of the empire State building and not stick out, ensuring a cohesive architectural appearance despite the functional challenges.
1459	16292	6	3	There were many problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as nature itself. At over a thousand feet the winds were just too strong and unpredictable to get close to and dock a dirigible safely. On top of nature, laws prevented the landing. Airships could not fly low over urban areas so even attempting to approach the area would be illegal. This idea still posed a great deal of potential danger even if there were no laws against it and wind didn't exist. Many dirigibles were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In such a highly populated area as New York City if one were to catch fire the damage would be horrifying, leading to catastrophic loss of life and property. I hope Al Smith was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the title of world's tallest building because he didn't get his mast, a costly and ultimately useless feature.
1460	16293	6	3	"Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense. The mast a top the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for the builders such as having to strengthen the frame work of the whole building to handle the immense stress. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects design is shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside-."" Furthermore, the building had to have two extra floors added one ""open observation platform"" and a ""boarding area for dirigidle passengers,"" adding to the complexity and cost. Even though the mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, the building was still hailed the world's tallest building, its iconic spire a monument to an ambitious but impractical vision."
1461	16294	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, certain obstacles such as foundation support, nature, and safety challenged the building of the docking station for dirigibles. The first problem the architects faced was the docked dirigibles placing too much stress on the building's structure. To combat this problem, drastic changes to the building would have to be made. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2) This structural reinforcement was stated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced upon constructing the mooring mast, was nature. At this extreme height, the wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Despite being tethered to the building, the dirigibles would spin and twist around the mast, an unsecure and dangerous aspect for both the airship and the building. Lastly, as the excerpt claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were too great. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been...above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3, @CAPS2 @NUM4) The mooring mast provided severe risk to the safety of the people of New York. This fundamental safety problem served as a serious and ultimately insurmountable obstacle for the builders of the mooring mast. In conclusion, the building's foundations, the forces of nature, and critical safety violations all served as significant problems for the builders creating the mooring mast."
1462	16295	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building which would let dirigibles anchor for several hours for refueling or service. But, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be sent all the way to the building's foundation. This requirement cost over @MONEY1 worth of modifications to be made to the framework. On May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the builders realized how catastrophic it would have been had such a disaster taken place above the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building would constantly shift due to harsh and violent air currents and the back of the ship would constantly swing around, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Also, the existing law against airships flying too low over cities and urban areas would make dirigibles not allowed to moor at the Empire State Building. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, which ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a practical reality.
1463	16296	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, some obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the winds were too strong and most used hydrogen instead of helium which is very flammable. The way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a cord attached to the mast. The dirigibles would then be ""dangling high above pedestrians in the street."" (@NUM1). This precarious situation was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM1). This would not only endanger the pedestrians below but also the people on the dirigibles themselves. The wind was so strong that it could throw the airship into a building. Furthermore, most dirigibles ran on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is much more flammable. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" (@NUM3) The owners of the Empire State building saw this as another huge problem because of how much worse it would be if one caught fire in densely populated New York. These combined dangers of high winds and flammable fuel made the entire concept too hazardous to implement."
1464	16297	6	3	"The Empire State Building during its construction was being planned to serve as a mast, in which dirigibles could be attached to. The builders of the building did not initially realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. Most of the problems presented were for the most part concerning public safety. Due to these safety issues the mast was considered too lucrative an idea, and posed too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these critical issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flammable gases, that if something went wrong a flaming dirigible coming down on downtown New York City would cause major damage and loss of life. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirigible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents"" (para @NUM1). Another reason why it couldn't be done ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (para @NUM2). All of the problems that could not be solved plausibly were the reason why the mast was ultimately an unrealistic and abandoned venture."
1465	16298	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the reason for the tall spire was revealed as a mooring mast for zeppelins to land. There were many difficulties faced by the builders of the Empire State building in the attempt for zeppelins to actually land there. One difficulty was the stress added by the weight of the dirigible; ""over @NUM1 $ of work was done to the foundation."" This was difficult because one could think adding that much steel to a beautiful building couldn't be easy. Another difficult addition involved ""the mast... would to a conical head this would house a mooring arm""; think about how easy it is to take an ornate @NUM2 foot spire @NUM3 feet to the top, not easy. Last, ""the winds at top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents""; this means all the framing workers went through hell to make the building stable under such conditions. These significant construction hurdles contributed to the overall challenge of realizing the mooring mast concept."
1466	16299	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was how much stress would be put on the buildings frame. L¸sted says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire state building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was peoples safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they were to make this happen there would always be the risk of someone catching on fire. Making the Empire State building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this happen, and ultimately these challenges proved too great for the concept to become a practical reality."
1467	16300	6	3	Many obstacles faced the builders of Empire State Building. The biggest problem is The fact that it was illegal for a dirigible to fly that low in Urban areas, stated in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem was that most of the @ORGANIZATION2's dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flamable. So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3. Also fears of the sharp edges and forceful winds would cause the dirigible to get punctured and pop, presenting a combination of legal, safety, and environmental challenges that ultimately prevented the plan from succeeding.
1468	16301	6	3	"During the @DATE1's Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle that the Dirigibles would face in landing in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. Another obstacle the architects and empire state builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the Dirigible to dock to the building, and also allowing people in and out of vehicle. Architects knew that they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. ""An A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" so architects had to reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen the structure of the building. The greatest obstacle that the Empire State builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents at the top of the empire state building would make it dangerous and unsafe for Dirigibles to dock with the building, rendering the ambitious plan impractical despite the initial enthusiasm for airship travel."
1469	16302	6	3	"In this excerpt Al Smith had many obstacals to over come when he wanted Dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The smallest obstacal was building this top so Dirigibles could moor at the building. ""The top would have cost Over @ORGANIZATION1 for the needed modifications on the Frame work"". Another obstacal faced was the fact that there was an existing law in place @CAPS1 this. ""The other practical reason Dirigibles could not more at the empire State building was an existing law against low flying air ships."" The issue of safety was a tricky obstacle. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is very @CAPS2. The Greatest obstacle was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting Due to violent air currents."" In this excerpt The obstacals For Al Smith and his team were to great and they could not over come them, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking scheme."
1470	16303	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, annanced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. At the time it would be the world's tallest building, but the builders faced obstacles with the more distinctive part; allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting do to violent air current. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivle around and the lead weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down below. Overall, the construction of the mast was difficult, and unfortunately is never to be used, standing only as a monument to an ambitious but unfeasible vision."
1471	16304	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame."" They would need to spend over @MONEY1 in order to modify the building's framework to handle this immense structural load. Another issue, ofcourse, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S., did not use helium. Instead, those limbs used hydrogen which is highly flamable and would have caused disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The excerpt also states that, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This unpredictable weather made a stable and safe docking procedure nearly impossible. @CAPS1, there was already a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, There fore, it would be illegal for a blimp to attach to or even go near the Empire State Building. For the reasons stated, builders were not able to build a functional and safe mooring mast a top the Empire State Building."
1472	16305	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. As @CAPS1 states, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This was because the design required careful integration with the building's structure. @CAPS2 the designers had to find a way for the dirigible to dock at the top of the building. Even if they did find a way for it to dock though, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This set the builders back again because even if they did find a way to dock the dirigible the Empire state building would need ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to reinforce the structure against this force. Even though that's possible there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which presented a legal barrier that could not be engineered away. The builders faced many obstacles that set them back but they made a valiant attempt to see their dream come true, though it ultimately remained unfulfilled."
1473	16306	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building, requiring significant and costly structural reinforcement. All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area, designed to facilitate passenger transfer. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top, symbolizing the ambitious venture. All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building, yet the fundamental challenges of safety and stability prevented the plan from becoming a practical reality.
1474	16307	6	3	"The designers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it's peak. ""The greatest reason was safety"" (para @NUM1). The dirigibles were dangerous. Strong winds could blow them in different directions, possibly hitting the building and causing catastrophic damage. And if there was a crash, the debris would rain upon New York City, endangering the populace below. Since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place. However above the city this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2), as a dropped weight would pose a grave danger. Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This would cause the docking to be illegal from the outset. For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced insurmountable challenges allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building."
1475	16308	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An example would be from the excerpt when the author writes in paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This quote means the builders were faced with the challenge of space to land the dirigibles because New York City was a relatively crowded area with no open fields. Another example would be in paragraph @NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen insted of helium, which is extremely flammable and created a severe fire risk. A last example would be in paragraph @NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building, which could easily destabilize a massive airship. Many obstacles came upon the builders, ultimately proving too difficult to overcome for the dirigible docking plan to succeed."
1476	16309	6	3	There were many obstacles for the builders of the mast attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked detail. Laws were an obstacle because of the significant safety risks of having a dirigible over a densely populated area, a fear tragically confirmed by events like the Hindenburg accident. Nature was a persistent problem because of the violent and unpredictable winds at the top of the mast, which would make the massive ship unsteady and difficult to control during docking maneuvers. The last obstacle was perhaps the most critical, as the builders of the mast overlooked all the other obstacles and the associated safety risks in their pursuit of the ambitious project. These combined challenges ultimately rendered the mooring mast impractical for its intended use.
1477	16310	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety; most dirigibles from outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen for lift. The catastrophic Hindenburg disaster demonstrated the inherent danger of this gas, and the building's planners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The immense risk to the city's inhabitants made the prospect of regular dirigible docking an unacceptable proposition from the outset.
1478	16311	6	3	"There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders had to face was the substantial financial cost, as they had ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to be made to the building's framework"" to strengthen it for the added load and stress of a moored airship. Another obstacle the builders faced was logistical, involving meetings with the president of an airship transport company to secure a plan to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean, a venture that was never realized. That is just two of the many obstacles the builders faced while building the Empire State Building, illustrating the complex challenges of this pioneering but ultimately futile endeavor."
1479	16312	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are significant. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, requiring over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. Another obstacle that they faced was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building due to an existing law against airships flying too low over suburban areas, which was intended for public safety. The greatest obstacle, however, was the violent air currents at that altitude, which would make the back of the ship swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. These fundamental issues proved insurmountable for the project's success.
1480	16313	6	3	I think the builders' main problem they faced was making sure people would be able to safely get off the dirigibles and onto the actual building, a process that would have been perilous at such a great height and in variable weather conditions. They would also need to make sure that the blimp wouldn't burst into flames if it came close or crashed into the Empire State Building, a grave concern given the use of combustible hydrogen gas in many airships of the era. These primary safety concerns, encompassing both passenger transfer and the risk of catastrophic fire, were central to the challenges confronting the builders and ultimately contributed to the mast's lack of practical use.
1481	16314	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast,"" there were several obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, they couldn't just put a mast atop the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame, which was not originally designed for such a load. Also, the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below the mast, creating a significant structural risk. So before they could build anything, they had to reinforce the entire structure of the Empire State Building to handle the immense forces involved. Finally, these obstacles were fixed through extensive engineering, but those were the primary challenges the builders had to overcome to realize the ambitious plan."
1482	16315	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. They chose a dirigible instead of a balloon for this purpose, primarily because the fabric and structure used in dirigibles is lighter and more suited for controlled flight. Second, a major impediment to their extended use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, a problem the mast was intended to solve. Furthermore, the architects had to think carefully about the safety of passengers as they got on or got off the airship at such a great height. Ultimately, these considerations defined the complex challenges of the project.
1483	16316	6	3	The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire State faced was the lack of a suitable landing area in the densely built city. The second obstacle that the builders faced was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof without considering the structural implications. However, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating unpredictable and hazardous conditions for docking a large, lightweight airship. These natural forces proved to be a formidable and ultimately limiting challenge for the entire venture.
1484	16317	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock were very difficult. One difficulty that they had was the mooring mast's exposure to nature itself. When the dirigibles would come to the building, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and the only way that they could moor is if they weighted down the back, a procedure that was deemed neither practical nor safe, especially with pedestrians in the streets far below. Another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law. The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area. This was a significant obstacle because they didn't have much recourse, as it was a government regulation holding them back. These legal and environmental challenges were just some of the obstacles that the builders faced in this ambitious attempt.
1485	16318	6	3	In the 1920s, dirigibles were considered to be the future of transportation. Although useful, dirigibles had an issue, there was not enough landing area in New York City for them to operate effectively. With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building; he would construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers to go on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed foolproof at the time, but this new construction plan encountered many obstacles. The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding dangerous stress to the building's frame. Architects detected that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle, which was modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle. Finally, the third obstacle, which was the expense, had to be confronted. Modifying the building's new framework to bear the load would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Consequently, Al Smith saw a great opportunity for the Empire State Building, but he was faced with many complex and costly obstacles from the outset.
1486	16319	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" written by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. As noted, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas."" (paragraph 6). If the dirigibles could not land properly, it could cause destruction and be very dangerous to people on the ground. In a contemporary account, Al Smith is quoted saying, ""It's on level all right no kidding wer'e working on the thing right now."" This phrasing shows the readers that the way he words things sounds almost unreliable, suggesting the plan was not fully formed. When constructing the idea for dirigibles, a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building to allow passengers on and off. However, this idea was ultimately unsafe. As the text explains, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" (paragraph 7). This inherent danger raises the question of why they would build something potentially harmful to others. In conclusion, the builders had a very hard time constructing a viable system for the dirigibles, facing fundamental safety and practical challenges that ultimately proved insurmountable."
1487	16320	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most influential obstacle was nature. According to the passage, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This unpredictable and forceful weather would make it exceptionally hard for the large, buoyant dirigibles to dock in the first place. If they even succeeded in docking, then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around uncontrollably. The only proposed way to solve that instability would be to add heavy weights to the back of the dirigibles. Then, those very weights would be floating high above the heads of pedestrians, which ""was neither practical or safe."" Another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time, there was a law against any kind of aircraft to ""fly too low over urban areas."" As the passage clarifies, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Consequently, the ambitious and celebrated mooring mast idea was ultimately dropped, proving to be an impractical venture from the start."
1488	16321	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. As noted, ""The architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A thousand-foot dirigible tethered by a single cable would add too much stress to the building's frame. Specifically, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" If not properly managed, the immense structural strain meant the Empire State Building might fall over. For the building to take this extra load, the architect would have to significantly modify and strengthen the building's existing framework. Also, the ornate mast would be difficult to raise on top of the Empire State Building due to the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mast. If this happened, the dirigible would risk crashing into the Empire State Building or other nearby structures, which would be disastrous for the people on the street. Where dirigibles usually land are in open fields, where they could be weighted down in the back with a lead weight. But on top of the Empire State Building, dangling weights above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Furthermore, laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting too close to a building, adding a final legal barrier to an already flawed concept."
1489	16322	6	3	"In the excerpt ""Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was that many structural modifications had to be made to the building's framework, as the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation to ensure stability. Another reason builders faced many obstacles is that most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen rather than safer helium. This would be very dangerous if a fire occurred, especially in a highly populated urban area like midtown Manhattan. Another critical reason is that due to violent air currents, the back of a dirigible would swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast. As the text states, the dirigible would dangle above pedestrians on the street, which wasn't practical or safe. Lastly, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach it. In conclusion, due to these combined structural, safety, and legal issues, the builders of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles to successfully allow dirigibles to dock there."
1490	16323	6	3	"The builders faced many problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building, which ranged from legal, to structural, to logistical problems. Firstly, there was a law in place which restricted airships from ""flying too low over urban area's,"" as explained in the text. This legal problem created an immediate and significant barrier. In addition to this, the builders confronted the structural problem of putting a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. According to the article, the stress of the dirigible's load along with wind pressure would have to be transmitted over eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Because of this added weight and force, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building's frame to reinforce it. Also, the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging. In fact, half of the attempted dirigible landings at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds, demonstrating the operational impossibility. Although a dirigible landing mast would have put the Empire State Building on the forefront of modern travel, the ambitious plan could not be realized due to these insurmountable legal, structural and logistical problems."
1491	16324	6	3	"The builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the Empire State Building, it ""would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The building would then have to be significantly modified to meet these structural needs. Nature played as a big obstacle, as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe and uncontrollable environment for both the crew and the building. Finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3), which presented a legal barrier that could not be easily overcome. These three main reasons collectively prevented dirigibles from ever successfully landing on top of The Empire State Building."
1492	16325	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced @NUM1 major obstacles in their plan for a dirigible dock. One major problem was that they intended to use hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and they were operating in a densely populated urban area, creating a severe fire risk. Another problem had to do with federal laws, because aircrafts aren't allowed to fly too low over urban areas, making the proposed landings illegal. Also, the strong and unpredictable winds at that extreme height made it practically impossible to achieve a stable and safe landing. Many complex problems were ultimately faced in the building of the Empire State Building's dirigible mast, leading to the concept's failure.
1493	16326	6	3	They had a good idea to make that building, but the problems were always big. To make the plan and design a reality was a monumental task. That was so difficult to make that building become a reality, requiring immense effort and resources from all involved in the project.
1494	16327	6	3	Many obstacles were established for the workers in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. At first they thought they knew what they were doing, but they were wrong. The workers' first obstacle was to make docking at the Empire State Building safe for everyone involved. However it was hard to make that happen because it was above civilians and if it ever dropped, the result would be extremely serious and catastrophic. The second obstacle that got in their way was the wind pressure at such a high altitude. It would have caused an unreliable support of the mast, which would screw up the delicate process of docking the dirigible. Finally, the dirigible itself is the last piece to the puzzle, and it was a design primed for disaster. In the section The Fate of The Mast, it gives that the dirigible is run on hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Just that sentence alone establishes that it is not safe for the environment or the people below. By far, many obstacles got in the way of the process of the mast, and docking was a whole different and more dangerous idea. Many obstacles had indeed gotten in the way of the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1495	16328	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face the challenge of working at great heights, being up in the air for so long, which was physically demanding and dangerous. They also had to face the difficulty of trying to dock the massive dirigible on top of the roof while still keeping themselves and the public safe from potential accidents. These significant hurdles made the entire docking proposition unfeasible.
1496	16329	6	3	The Empire State Building did have a flat roof, but the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the roof because it would add significant stress to the building's frame. To build a structurally sound mooring mast, the cost would be more than sixty thousand dollars. Building a functional mooring mast would not be easy because the wind on top of the Empire State Building would constantly change direction; therefore, the dirigibles would be swirling around unpredictably. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these on the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Then there was a law that aircraft should not fly too low over urban areas, which presented another legal barrier. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was this existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. For dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building, there were simply too many insurmountable obstacles to overcome.
1497	16330	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles builders faced in constructing a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed. One obstacle builders faced was how to go about attaching it securely. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add immense stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacle would be the accumulated cost of the revisions and reinforcements due to the first problem. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" These significant structural and financial obstacles ultimately prevented the mast from ever being used for its intended purpose."
1498	16331	6	3	The construction of the mast was intentionally a good idea, but the people who were constructing it never actually realized the true dangers of the whole concept. Although they should have known, they should have realized that because the ship was attached to the mast in one area, the ship was bound to swing around when it comes to a windy day because of the lack of weight and the force of the gusts. The builders also had to keep in mind that because the idea was huge and highly publicized, they had to make it perfect. They had to realize that many other builders are going to try this concept which means they have to lead by example. If not then the other builders would have major problems and people would be in danger. The builders and men who thought about using weights to balance off the weight of the ship faced a difficult challenge. They needed to find a safe way to accomplish this and unfortunately they could not devise one. If they went through with it, one accident could have killed many people on the streets below. The dirigible mooring mast was a great idea in theory, but they should have thought out the practical ideas and dangers before they went ahead and built it.
1499	16332	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the architects faced a number of problems. One problem they had was that the ""dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The architects had to modify and strengthen the building significantly to accommodate the new situation and the immense forces involved. The dirigible was so big that they could not even anchor the back of it to the roof securely. The architects had a difficult time trying to figure out how the dirigibles would land because the wind was so strong and variable that the pilot could not even control the dirigible reliably. The architects had to put another sixty thousand dollars into the project because of the necessary structural modifications. Al Smith was the one who thought of this idea, but then he realized it wouldn't work in practice. Even after the architects finished constructing it, the dirigibles could not dock there safely or legally."
1500	16333	6	3	"Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. First and foremost, a mooring mast would have to be added to the building. However, according to the source, ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" before a dirigible could be moored to the mast, representing a major financial and engineering challenge. Secondly, outside of the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, rather than helium. The owners realized that it would be quite dangerous to have a dirigible moored over downtown New York, a concern tragically highlighted after the German ""Hindenburg"" ""was destroyed by fire."" In accordance with the text, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Violent winds, caused by air currents at the top of the building would cause a moored dirigible to swivel dangerously, and using lead weights to counter this would be perilous over such a densely populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even dock in December 1930 due to powerful winds. Lastly, an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast anyway. For all these reasons, the ambitious plan was ultimately unworkable."
1501	16334	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a significant obstacle in building a dock for dirigibles. One of the primary problems they faced was that they did not have a suitable landing area. In paragraph six it said that the mast would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, which was a very limited window for practical operations. Also, they had realized that most dirigibles from outside the country used hydrogen instead of helium, which was more highly flammable and posed a severe safety risk. In paragraph thirteen they said that an accident could have been far worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, highlighting the potential for catastrophic consequences."
1502	16335	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in constructing the skyscraper and also allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was the expanded use of airships in New York City. As said on page 4 paragraph 6, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area,"" which the mooring mast was intended to solve. Another obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was Nature itself, as also stated on page 5 paragraph 8: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself."" The third obstacle was the weather; for an example, on page 5 paragraph 9, ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" These are just a few concluding examples of the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock near the Empire State Building."
1503	16336	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A couple of those obstacles are, first, the immense stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This is a critical issue because ""the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which means the forces acting on the mast nearly eleven hundred feet in the air would have to be safely transferred to the ground. Another obstacle is that they figured out that ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" The reasons for this are because fundamental problems, such as the unpredictable wind conditions, should have been apparent before the mast was ever constructed. Those are just a couple of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in this ambitious endeavor."
1504	16337	6	3	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced involved many things surrounding safety and money issues. Successfully docking the dirigible would mean spending over fifty thousand dollars more, to make special arrangements and reinforcements to the building's structure. Also, there were many safety problems such as the flammable gas the dirigible carried, the extreme danger to people below in the city in case of an accident, and the fact that it was against the law for airships to be flying so low over populated urban areas. These financial and safety concerns combined to create a formidable challenge for the project's success.
1505	16338	6	3	The Empire State Building faced significant hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the primary problem they had was safely docking thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, which the mast was supposed to provide. Winds in New York would also make it extremely difficult to land, as gusts could push the airships dangerously off course. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also profoundly unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad a similar disaster could've been in a highly populated area such as New York, leading to the ultimate failure of the mooring mast concept.
1506	16339	6	3	"The idea of the Empire State Building being used to dock dirigibles may seem ridiculous now, but upon its construction, this was the original purpose of the mast at the top. Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally, effectively prohibiting any such attempt from the outset. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard for both the craft and the city below. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of the safer helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay, a conclusion that was quickly realized."
1507	16340	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock dirigibles at their building were that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen over helium, the winds at the top of the building violently changed, and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas. First of all, foreign blimps using hydrogen are very dangerous due to the high risk that they will burst into flames. This only occurred to the builders when a German blimp Hindenburg caught on fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they ""realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident happened over New York City, many more lives would have been lost, creating a catastrophic event. Also, the winds above the building change constantly, which would make the blimp unstable. The article explains this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would be torture on the back of the ship, as the front would be secured due to its tethering, but the back would be left free to sway and swing in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at a high risk of danger from such unpredictable motion, making this idea impractical. Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, nevermind dock on it. The article tells this by saying, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed, and this legal barrier was insurmountable. In conclusion, the three obstacles stopping the use of the Empire State Building were the hydrogen gas used in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds making the craft swivel, and the law prohibiting aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas, which together made the plan unworkable."
1508	16341	6	3	Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City, risking a massive disaster. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to powerful air currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people, posing a constant threat. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work around this legal restriction. These combined issues ultimately prevented the mast from being used for its intended purpose.
1509	16342	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some big obstacles. One obstacle was they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely, which involved complex engineering considerations. They had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely, a process that would be perilous at such a great height. Lastly they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast, ensuring the structural integrity of the entire skyscraper was maintained. These examples shows that the builders were faced with many obstacles when building the Empire State Building, each requiring a careful and calculated solution."
1510	16343	6	3	The building wasn't designed to carry the extra weight of having a dirigible attach to the top, posing a significant structural challenge. And the dirigibles had to have weights drop from the back to keep it in place, that wouldnt be very safe have lead weights dangle over a thousand feet in the air above a densely populated city. The mast was built out of Glass which could have been dangerous if a dirigible couldnt stop and went straight into the tower, causing a serious collision. Also the electronic winching stations didn't seem like they would work to well, raising doubts about the practicality of the entire docking procedure. These various design and safety flaws illustrate why the dirigible docking plan was ultimately abandoned.
1511	16344	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was an existing law that was against airships flying low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever fly up to a building, creating a fundamental legal barrier to the docking plan. The other major problem occurred in 1930 when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. These powerful winds would blow the dirigible towards the building's sharp spires, presenting a clear and immediate danger. These legal and practical challenges were the primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigible docking.
1512	16345	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the building, was determined to outstrip the height of the Chrysler Building. However, the architect of the Chrysler Building had a trick up his sleeve, building a 185-foot spire and hoisting it to the top. Smith was therefore determined to outstrip this height by placing a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building. Yet, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof, as the winds would be constantly shifting the mast. Furthermore, using these at the great height, where they would be clanging high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building also due to a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a combination of competitive, engineering, and legal obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock there.
1513	16346	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles did not use helium, instead using hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because it is extremely flammable, creating a substantial safety risk. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, where a dirigible caught fire, it would cause a threat to New York City, which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up, the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another major problem was the winds, which could easily blow the dirigible off its course or, worse, into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" was attempting to reach the mooring mast, as the captain could not get anywhere near it. These obstacles and dangers suggested the mooring mast was a bad idea, which the constructers later came to realize."
1514	16347	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to build the highest building in New York because they wanted to be so big and they had been working on it for so many years. This immense ambition to achieve record-breaking height introduced complex engineering and logistical difficulties that were compounded by the project's long duration. The sheer scale of the undertaking required unprecedented resources and planning, pushing the limits of contemporary construction techniques. Ultimately, the goal of becoming the tallest structure defined the project's unique set of hurdles from its inception through its completion.
1515	16348	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are detailed. One set of engineers in New York was trying to dope out a practical workable arrangement, and government people in Washington were figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building and held by a single cable tether would add significant stress to the building's frames. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to address these structural challenges."
1516	16349	6	3	Based on the excerpt there are three reasons why there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These reasons were, one it was too close to the city and not high up enough, which presented a significant challenge for the large airships attempting to navigate the urban landscape. The second reason is because the wind spun the blimp around the mast, making a stable and secure connection nearly impossible to maintain. And the third reason is because German blimps were filled with hydrogen, which if next to a heat source it would blow up, creating an immense safety risk. And American blimps were filled with the safer helium, but this did not fully mitigate the other dangers involved. Ultimately, these combined factors ensured the dirigible docking concept was impractical from the start.
1517	16350	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock there were three major obstacles: the wind, the structure, and the safety. The wind was the most obvious flaw in the landing dock because of the rough wind currents at the top of the building. Landing perfectly on the dock was one thing, but staying there was impossible because you would have been whipped around. ""The United States Navy dirigible Los Angeles feared that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings of the area, which would puncture the shell."" The problem of structuring the mast to hold the balloon would also become a structural obstacle because the engineers couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. To get the structure sound enough to land a dirigible they would have to do sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework, a costly and complex undertaking. Lastly, landing a huge metal balloon on top of the largest skyscraper, over millions of city dwellers, even when they knew the balloons were highly flammable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast didn't work out. Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration, a testament to an ambitious but flawed vision."
1518	16351	6	3	"The builders and the architects faced many issues in making this project of extending the Empire State Building to 1,250 feet height. Though they planned their steps into making the mooring mast on top was unrealistic. It was unrealistic because this was never done before on top of a building, presenting unprecedented engineering challenges. Another obstacle they faced was safety of the passengers and in general, because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable and posed a constant threat of explosion. Another obstacle they faced was with the weather, because landing a dirigible on top of the building with fast winds due to the violent air currents was also dangerous for the people on the dirigibles and could've possibly hit other building by swiveling around in the air from the winds. The last obstacle the builders faced, was that their project was illegal, against the federal law because the dirigibles would be flying too close to urban areas such as New York City, so therefore be impossible to accomplish. In the relevant paragraph it states ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This shows proof of the project's inherent incapability to be built as a functional docking station."
1519	16352	6	3	"Ultimately, it is evident that the entire concept of Al Smith's dirigible dock on the Empire State building was strategically flawed. It was Al Smith's dream, but dream is not always reality. In theory, the Mooring Mast would be constructed to dock dirigibles. However, it was eventually revealed that a docking station on the Empire State building would never be possible. The reason Al Smith's dream could never prove to be reality is because Smith and the builders hit many obstacles. One obstacle faced with the construction of the mast was the location. When a landing zone is 1,250 ft above ground level, it is extremely tough to test and complete a perfect landing zone, much tougher then if it was on ground level. Also, with location is the safety of having such high wind speeds at such an altitude. It is known that the higher altitude you get the higher the air pressure and the ""violent air currents"" you will have, making a very unsafe environment for any airship attempting to dock. Next, another aspect of the location was the fact it was in densely populated New York City, if there were any mistakes a great number of casualties would be expected. Lastly, a large obstacle Smith and the builders faced was technology, in the 1920's and 1930's the amount of technology and engineering was certainly unparallel to the technology prevalent in today's society, making the ambitious project unfeasible with the available means."
1520	16353	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that Al Smith constructed a 185 foot spire inside the building to make it taller, aiming to create the world's tallest structure. By the 1920's the new airships called dirigibles was hailed as the future of transportation. They was like blimps but was filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. In New York city they had a lack of suitable landing area for these massive dirigibles, creating a clear logistical problem. Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast to the top of the building so they could tie the line from the front of the ship, envisioning a revolutionary urban airfield. However, this solution proved inadequate against the practical challenges of wind, safety, and urban density, rendering the docking plan ultimately unsuccessful.
1521	16354	6	3	The planners of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over cities, meaning they couldn't safely approach and dock at the Empire State building. Another obstacle was that foreign blimps often used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is very flammable, so using hydrogen blimps in a densely populated urban center would create significant public safety issues. Finally, nature would prove to be the greatest obstacle because of the high-altitude wind, which could get quite violent and cause the blimps to possibly get untied from the building or fall. In conclusion, there were many legal, safety, and environmental obstacles that the planners of the Empire State building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1522	16355	6	3	The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the High Winds. The powerful winds blew the dirigibles two-and-fro, making a stable connection nearly impossible. It would be catastrophic if an accident occurred. Secondly, The Law stood in the way of this idea. A law in New York was passed, that prevented dirigibles from flying over urban areas. The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey that highlighted the dangers. Lastly, and probably the simplest, There was no clear way to land! The proper landing gear and procedures had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt a landing. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in most ways.
1523	16356	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building and sought a new purpose. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. Dirigibles were to be docked by means of an electric winch. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, however. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add tremendous stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in back with lead weights, but this was not feasible on a skyscraper. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, all though two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the city below, the project was ultimately deemed impractical.
1524	16357	6	3	"The dream of the aviation pioneers of docking their dirigibles on the Empire State Building created significant obstacles for the builders to face. The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built with it, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to unpredictable air currents. It was extremely difficult for the large, slow-moving dirigibles to dock securely. The ""four-blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above the city, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets below. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of these forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the proper dirigible mooring equipment was never fully installed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that ultimately gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."""
1525	16358	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building came upon some significant problems when putting in the dock for dirigibles. First, the sheer height of the building makes catching the dirigibles dangerous because of the tower's structure and the exposure to the elements. If the dirigible was to crash, it would be falling onto a big city's streets, endangering countless people. Furthermore, the high winds at that altitude made stable mooring a serious challenge. Finally, most dirigibles at the time were filled with hydrogen and that is highly flammable, creating a constant fire hazard. That is why the entire concept of the mooring mast was ultimately considered too dangerous to be practical.
1526	16359	6	3	The Mooring Mast has two primary obstacles preventing its successful use. The first is the winds on top of the building, which are constantly shifting due to violent air currents that create an unstable and hazardous environment for docking. The other reason dirigibles could not moor at the structure was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier to the operation. They try to get close but they can't because of these forceful winds. In nineteen thirty, the notable @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles approched the mooring but could not get close enough to dock securely. So they stablish a low to a securit for a urban Area, reinforcing the legal framework that ultimately prevented the mast from being a practical landing site for airships.
1527	16360	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obsticles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obsticle is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a big threat to the nearby pedestrians and city infrastructure in the event of an accident. Furthermore, an additional obsticle is ""nature itself,"" as the winds are constantly changing, which is dangerous for the large and cumbersome dirigibles attempting to maneuver. One last example of an obsticle is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would be dangerous if the dirigible lost control and harmed a pedestrian, and it also created a legal impediment to the docking process. These are @CAPS1 some examples in the article of how there were many obsticles the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, illustrating the multitude of challenges involved."
1528	16361	6	3	"Builders of The Mooring @CAPS1 by @ORGANIZATION2 face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In order to ensure safety and eliminate problems involving the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need ""to be modified and strengthened to accommodate"" the blimps, and these modification would cost up to sixty thousand dollars, a substantial financial undertaking. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremly flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible was to blow up, creating a severe safety risk. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe during the docking procedure. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low, presenting a legal challenge. These difficult obstacles proved too difficult to overcome, as the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles and remains largely a historical curiosity."
1529	16362	6	3	It was very difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face many obstacles along the way, which complicated the ambitious project. One obstacle was that they kept trying to make the building higher. Al Smith was very competitive with the architect who was constructing the Chrysler Building which was also in New York City. Smith wanted it larger and by extending it, it became more dangerous and difficult to allow docks up there due to the increased height and exposure. Another obstacle was the weather at the top of the building. The winds at that height were very rigorous and with a highly populated area below, they did not want an accident to occur that could endanger people on the ground. Allowing docs up on the Empire State Building was very dangerous, and these combined factors ultimately hindered the practical use of the mooring mast.
1530	16363	6	3	"New York is said to be, ""the city that never sleeps,"" a place of constant activity. The people of New York are always awake, rushing about in the streets. When four-term governor, Al Smith, wanted to put up a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, these people of New York had many concerns, as did the people whom were constructing the building. These concerns consisted of laws, saftey and construction, creating a complex web of challenges. If a mooring mast was built, a law they'd have to worry about would be flying airships too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area, presenting a fundamental legal problem. Another major worry was safety. These dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible had caught fire above New York City, the damage could be tragic and widespread. The construction of the mast was out of the question because they never had planned on making it prior to starting the project, leading to unforeseen engineering issues. Overall, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never really destined to have been created successfully. Too many factors and obstacles were in the way after the idea of creating the mooring mast began, ensuring it remained an impractical and unused feature."
1531	16364	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They had to find a way to keep the dirigibles from spinning around the top of the tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant the dirigibles would swivel around the mast unless tied down, making a secure connection nearly impossible. The next problem or obstacle was making the building's structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" indicating the immense structural strain. The next challenge was to create a safe environment for the pedestrians below. That was not possible because the city was already made below. The dirigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe,"" posing a constant risk from such a great height. Clearly the builders faced significant and ultimately insurmountable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."
1532	16365	6	3	The builders, faced with the ambitious goal of enabling dirigible docking at the skyscraper's summit, encountered a series of complex challenges from the outset. The primary issue involved stabilizing the massive airships against the powerful and unpredictable winds at such a high altitude. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the tower itself was a major concern, as the force exerted by a moored dirigible would place enormous stress on the steel frame. Ensuring the safety of people in the surrounding streets and buildings also presented a critical difficulty, as any mishap would have severe consequences. These fundamental problems proved too great to overcome, demonstrating the impracticality of the entire docking concept from the very beginning.
1533	16366	6	3	Al Smith and his workers went through quite a bit while working on this building. As an example, while building it they had to transmit the stress of the dirigible's load all the way to the building's foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below, a formidable engineering task. After that they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to accommodate the new situation, requiring extensive and costly reinforcements. The greatest obstacle throughout the whole process though was nature itself. Due to violent air currents the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, making any stable mooring a dangerous gamble. Safety was a major obstacle Smith had to face while building this building. Smith thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building but little did he know how dangerous using one could be. Due to the fact most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, using hydrogen meant the airships were highly flammable, introducing a catastrophic risk of fire or explosion that ultimately doomed the venture.
1534	16367	6	3	"In the novel the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Because in the novel it said ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This quote said that the dirigible would add stress to the building and create a serious risk of collapsing under the immense and unpredictable forces. The sheer size and weight of the airship, combined with the leverage from the tether, presented a fundamental danger to the structural integrity of the entire skyscraper, highlighting a core flaw in the ambitious docking plan."
1535	16368	6	3	They faced many problems when trying to dock there. It should never have been made in the first place. Too many things were predictable failures. They had no landing gear, which was a basic necessity for securing the aircraft. The wind was too great a factor, and the ships couldn't get close enough to the mast to dock, as the powerful gusts pushed them away. The people creating this overlooked the possibility of it not working and only looked toward building it. They had no landing gears whatsoever so it was hard to steady it and dock it properly. The wind was unpredictable and swung the balloon around violently. The biggest thing was when they slowed it down and had no wind it still couldn't get close enough to dock, revealing a fundamental design flaw. Those are the primary problems they faced, each one contributing to the ultimate failure of the docking scheme.
1536	16369	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigible's weight was held by a single cable tether that ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was far below. This immense force posed a significant structural challenge. If the cable tether were to ever break, passengers in the dirigible and civilians of New York would be in grave danger from falling debris or a crashing airship. This cable tether would be too risky to use. The builders could not possibly overcome nature and its ""violent air currents"" for the winds they encountered at the top of the building. These powerful currents would cause docking to potentially be too time-consuming and dangerous, making precise maneuvers nearly impossible. The builders and architects tried to reverse this obstacle by weighing down ""the back with lead weights."" This was ""neither practical or safe,"" because of the potential danger of the weights falling and hitting New York pedestrians below. The builders and architects of this grand project had to quarrel with many gargantuan obstacles in order to dock at the Empire State Building, and ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable."
1537	16370	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders went through was that they had to make many changes, such as they could not just drop a mast on top of the building's flat roof. The blimp would give the building stress held by a single cable. The blimp's load and pressure from the wind would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, requiring a fundamental reinforcement of the entire structure. The frame could have to be strengthened to accommodate this new situation, a costly and complex engineering feat. This necessary reinforcement came at a great expense, costing over sixty thousand dollars for the new framework. Despite this significant investment, the fundamental problems of safety and practicality remained unresolved, leading to the mast's eventual obsolescence.
1538	16371	6	3	Creating a mooring mast to sit atop the Empire State Building that would function and allow dirigibles to dock there was an incredibly challenging task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the extra weight and size of a mooring mast, architects had to work to redesign the frame of the whole building. The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this structural problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the inherent danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimp from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was against the law for aircraft to fly over urban areas, and that was the final legal obstacle that kept the mooring mast from being used for its intended purpose.
1539	16372	6	3	"There were many obstacles in the process of building a mooring mast. The designers had to think their way around them. It was easily known you couldn't just go up to the top and start construction. There were accommodations to be made. The excerpt describes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" This meant that just adding it on would upset the building's structure and foundation, requiring a complete reassessment of the building's core support. Safety was a major concern. People realized it was a bad idea to have something as highly flammable as the dirigible so close to a populated area. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" After recent fires, it was noticed how dangerous this idea was. Control was an issue in the city, rather than an open field. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" That wasn't going to 'fly' with most people; it would be almost impossible to keep it stable for people loading. Designers face a lot of problems in constructing buildings but in this case, the mooring mast just wasn't meant to be a feasible reality."
1540	16373	6	3	"The Empire State Building was destined to reach new limits that had never been met or even thought of in the world of architecture. As described, the determined efforts in building a mast not only set the Empire State Building as the tallest building, at a remarkable height, but also to serve a useful purpose, was a radical dream supported with intuitive design and high goals. Unfortunately, the reality in successfully completing this far-reached destination was slim as problems gradually arose. The largest obstacle was ""... one of safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" This, along with the fact that violent air currents at such great heights required that lead weights weighted the dirigible down to prevent extreme movement, served as serious cautions for the safety of the highly populated New York City surrounding the Empire State Building. As practicality in the hopeful mooring mast diminished, it became ""...desirable to post to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The use of the mooring mast then ""quietly disappeared"", concluding the radical dreams of airship travel from the skyscraper's pinnacle."
1541	16374	6	3	Al Smith had a clear and ambitious vision: to create a revolutionary site for modern travel atop the Empire State Building. Smith faced many significant obstacles but persisted with tremendous hard efforts in his attempt to bring his vision to life. The immense stress of a thousand-foot dirigible moored to the building would have exerted far too much pressure for the original framework to handle. Consequently, over @MONEY1 worth of structural changes had to be made to significantly strengthen the building's steel framework. In addition, the builders had designed a specialized mast that would be rocket-shaped, constructed from lightweight aluminum, which could properly accomodate the mooring arm. The control machienery for the operation would be housed within the shaft, which also contained elevators and stairs for the passengers arriving on the dirigible. Another critical obstacle they had to face was the initial lack of floors that would serve as a dedicated boarding area. They had therefore begun to build additinoal floors featuring a glassed-in observation area and a secure boarding area. Although the ambitious plan for a mooring mast for dirigibles ultimately proved to be a fiasco, Al Smith and the many architects involved tried earnestly to make all the modifications they could have to fulfill Smith's powerful vision for what he thought was the Empire State Building's ultimate destiny.
1542	16375	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a daunting series of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as detailed in the excerpt *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. The first major obstacle was the imperative to make the mooring mast safe for passengers to board on and off the airships. The Architects had a team of engineers and other specialists working diligently on this complex problem. Another significant obstacle the Architects had to work with was the physical challenge of putting the massive mooring mast up on the very top of the towering building. So, then they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of reinforcements to the framework of the building so that it would be sturdy enough to support the mooring mast. Once the mooring mast was finally set up and they had ""celebrated framing the entire building,"" just another critical problem occurred. It was noted that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" for the powerful and unpredictable winds were constantly shifting and caused any docked dirigible to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. Finally, after they had fixed all of their identified problems for this building to be in use, the biggest obstacle of all occurred: dirigibles became largely illegal and air planes became the new dominant form of transportation. The builders of the Empire State building had simply faced just too many obstacles and ultimately failed in their dirigible docking endeavor."
1543	16376	6	3	As the builder's dream for the Empire State building grew larger and more ambitious, so did the extensive modifications they needed to make to realize it. To begin, they needed to research and engineer a safe and practical way for the large dirigible to dock securely at such a great height. This initial challenge was soon addressed with the help of specialized navy and government research into aeronautics. The next great struggle was the fundamental structure of the building itself. Adding a heavy mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the very top of the sky scraper would profoundly effect the structural frame. In order for the entire building to be structurely sound and safe, the steel frame was heavily modified and reinforced to withstand the added stress from the mast and the moored airships. Even with all this dedicated research and costly structural modifications, the ambitious docking system was never successfully put in place. The strong and perpetually shifting winds above the Empire State Building simply would not allow for a large blimp to actually dock safely and remain stable, and so the innovative idea was soon let go. In the end, passenger safety and the uncontrollable wind were the two primary challenges that the builders could not over come.
1544	16377	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many complex obstacles in the course of bringing Al Smith's ambitious plans to life. One of the initial legal hurdles was that ""air ships flying too low over Urban areas"" was deemed illegal, creating an immediate regulatory barrier. If breaking the law wasn't a large enough obstacle, then the critical issue of New York citizen's public safety also came directly into play. Most dirigibles of the era were notoriously dangerous due to their high flamability, being filled with combustible hydrogen. So one wrong move during a docking maneuver could have killed many people ""if it had [exploded] above a densley populated area"" like midtown Manhattan. Another huge obstacle that came into play was the inherent lightness of the dirigibles, a characteristic that would allow its rear end to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" in the wind. The only conceivable way to stop that dangerous motion would be to use ground crews holding guide ropes, which would again, put the citizens on the streets below in grave danger. These combined safety and legal issues proved insurmountable for the project's success."
1545	16378	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced were fundamentally about ensuring the structure's integrity and the safety of its operations. They had to make the building exceptionally strong to support the additional load. Also they had to be sure that the dirigibles themselves wouldn't destroy the building or the mast when it landed, requiring a delicate and precise docking process. They also had to be care ful that the dirigbles would not crash in to the building when it was droping off the passengers or the papers. An other significant obstacle for the workes was that the driagbles, being large and cumbersome, would not be able to land easily in the turbulent urban wind conditions. Finally, they would have to make sure that nothing is out of place and that every single component of the complex system was working together perfectly in order to avoid a catastrophic failure. Despite these efforts, the practical challenges were too great to overcome.
1546	16379	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. The engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the building's structure. To fix this, they had to reinforce the entire building, a complex and costly undertaking that involved strengthening the core framework. In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg, a catastrophic event that highlighted the immense risks of handling such large, volatile airships. Ultimately, these significant challenges proved too great to overcome for regular operations.
1547	16380	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible been supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably have pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas, requiring meticulous care to avoid damaging the fragile components. The builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for dirigible docking, and these structural and material challenges were central to the project's difficulties.
1548	16381	6	3	"When faced with the prospect of building the tallest building in the world, Al Smith refused to give up. In order to achieve his goal, he decided to build a dirigible docking mast atop his new creation. But with this genius idea came obstacle after obstacle, preventing the idea from ever taking flight. One obstacle faced by Al Smith, and by far the greatest, was safety. Most non-American dirigibles used hydrogen within their dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad it would have been if a fiery explosion happened ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" creating a public safety nightmare. Another great obstacle was nature itself. ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it impossible for the dirigible to be tethered without the back of ship swiveling around the mooring mast, rendering a stable and secure connection unfeasible. These fundamental issues ultimately doomed the ambitious docking plan."
1549	16382	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law. Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over a populated areas such as New York City. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City, threatening thousands of lives. Nature causes lots of obstacles in life, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivel around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe. There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped, but they were unsuccessful. Safety, nature, and the law kept Al Smith's dream from coming true. These obstacles were the ones the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1550	16383	6	3	"The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. When they tried to build it there was not enough space so they tried to force it but that would mess everything up. The concept was for ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, without stress to the building's frame,"" but this ideal scenario was structurally unrealistic. At times when they try to add things that made the building only heavier and more likely to fall, they compromised the integrity they sought to achieve. They tried to add more things to only make it look better but what they didn't know is that it was only going to fall more, as each addition increased the load on the already strained design. The fundamental miscalculations regarding space and structural load meant the mooring mast was an impractical feature from the start."
1551	16384	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which made the precise maneuvering required for docking an airship nearly impossible. This natural challenge was compounded by a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which created a legal barrier to the operation even if the technical difficulties could have been overcome. Ultimately, the combination of unpredictable weather and regulatory restrictions proved insurmountable for the envisioned purpose of the mast.
1552	16385	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. Lusted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction. Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As Lusted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" in the turbulent winds. The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became a critical issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field."" The laws in effect at the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and this law made docking a dirigible impossible in New York City. The construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required ""over a million dollars worth of modifications"" and a lot of time and planning. As Lusted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" The obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were too great and too many; the laws, safety concerns, construction challenges, and nature of the time were too big a setback for this endeavor."
1553	16386	6	3	There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated to construct and integrate. Another reason consists of existing laws. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which directly prohibited the planned operations. New York is definitely not the city for this idea just because there are a lot of people walking around the streets and there are many buildings around, raising significant safety concerns. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would come to be over with the invention and rise of airplanes, which offered a more practical form of air travel. The idea eventually disappeared as the impracticalities became clear.
1554	16387	6	3	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also, trying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacle the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the building's frame. If the builders wanted to fix that, it would involve the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below, a massive undertaking. The framework of the building would cost too much money to reinforce sufficiently. The stress on the building would come from the dirigible's load and the constant wind pressure. Another obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind itself. The violent air currents would cause the building to continuously shift, making a stable docking procedure impossible. They didn't want to use lead weights for stabilization because it was too dangerous, as they would be dangling high over pedestrians. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low over populated areas. They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock, and these challenges ultimately prevented its successful use.
1555	16388	6	3	"The main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were mainly safety and nature itself. Safety was most important, and because they were aiming at having dirigibles land on top of the building, they needed to make sure it was completely safe. In the reading it states that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" Because it is flammable, the builders realized how much danger it could cause especially in a high populated area like New York City, where a fire would be catastrophic. Now besides safety, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. With having the mooring mast at a steep height on top of the Empire State Building came with many difficulties that revolved around the weather and atmosphere. The winds on the top of the building were always shifting, which would make it hard to land dirigibles with any precision. Because of the unsustainable air currents, nothing could be done to stabilize the airships effectively. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Due to the roughness of the wind and the unidealistic design of the dirigible for such a location, safety and nature were the main obstacles in the creation of the Empire State Building's docking port."
1556	16389	6	3	Builders faced many problems with dirigibles attempting to dock on the Empire State Building. The first problem they faced was the powerful and unpredictable wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control, creating a serious risk of hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock safely, and so the Los Angeles ultimately gave up on the attempt. Another reason builders faced a problem with dirigibles docking on the empire state building was that there was a specific law that said airships were not permitted to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building in the first place, and therefore they simply wouldn't be able to dock under any circumstances. These combined issues of natural forces and legal restrictions proved insurmountable for the ambitious docking plan.
1557	16390	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory. The first problem was the immense weight of the blimp combined with the malicious winds, a force that threatened to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that structural problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem they would encounter. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature herself. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With a dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream. Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work in practice. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles collectively made it impossible to proceed with the construction, leaving Al Smith with amazing imagination but ultimately bad luck."
1558	16391	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face a series of obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast itself. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be substantially strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of a massive dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the extensive reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were initially excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment in transportation. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" a fact proving that the mooring mast was inherently unsafe and could lead to potential catastrophic accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship attempting to dock the dirigible. Lastly, the law states clear restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law by approaching the mast. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many fundamental faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many interconnected problems that could not have been solved in their endeavor to allow the dirigibles to dock."
1559	16392	6	3	"The idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building seemed like a grand idea at the time of construction, but it had many obstacles to overcome from the very beginning. The builders first had to make ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the buildings steel frame to provide the necessary reinforcement. This costly reinforcement would strengthen the building against the enormous pressure a docked dirigible would create. Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as just placing one atop the building; it required significant infrastructure. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers, which also included an elevator and a staircase to bring passengers down to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof structure before they could even begin framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious and forward-thinking, although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low, especially considering the fact builders were working a thousand feet high. This ambitious idea ultimately presented too many challenges to be considered feasible."
1560	16393	6	3	The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top of its spire. To do this they would need to build a specialized mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to it and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them throughout the planning process. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be too unstable and cause too much stress to the structure. To prevent a structural failure, what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the building's frame as a whole, a project costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in safely; the proposed answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was public safty, as dirigibles outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's own violently shifting winds at that altitude; to solve a similar problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be profoundly unsafe. The final nail in the coffin for this plan was that there is an existing law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas, making the entire concept illegal.
1561	16394	6	3	The obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the powerful winds encountered on top of the structure. This is because the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, a condition that would make the dirigibles swivel around in the air uncontrollably. Another significant obstacle the dirigibles had was their reliance on gases like hydrogen and helium, the former of which is highly flammable and posed a tremendous fire risk. These combined issues of unstable weather and volatile fuel sources created an insurmountable challenge for the intended docking operation, ultimately leading to its failure.
1562	16395	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, including the challenge of high winds and the legal restriction against flying an aircraft too low near urban areas. One primary obstacle was ensuring the safety of dirigibles anchoring above the busy streets filled with people, a situation made perilous by the high winds. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so any foreign dirigible anchored at the building would pose a significant safety issue. The high winds at the top could cause an accident, potentially making the dirigible explode and endanger pedestrians below. Another obstacle was the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to dock at the building because aircraft were prohibited from flying too low near urban areas, and obtaining government permission would have been a long and difficult process. These legal and safety hurdles proved too great to overcome.
1563	16396	6	3	The builders faced so many obstacles to mooring dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One of the greatest obstacles was nature itself, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to dangerous air currents. These violent gusts would cause the back of a dirigible to swivel around and around the mooring mast, making a secure attachment nearly impossible. The prospect of these massive airships dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe from the outset. Compounding these physical dangers was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a separate legal barrier. Ultimately, there were simply too many obstacles to successfully moor dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1564	16397	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles with trying to build a docking station for dirigibles. They first needed to make costly modifications to strengthen the building to accommodate this new situation, a financial and engineering hurdle they were ultimately able to overcome. The next, more persistent problem was that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and after the tragic fire of the Hindenburg, the public fully realized how potentially dangerous this docking idea truly was. Another critical problem was the weather, as the high winds at such an altitude could cause severe instability when the dirigibles were trying to dock. To top off this list of problems was the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the final analysis, there were just too many obstacles for the builders to overcome, and the mooring mast was never successful.
1565	16398	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were severe. The greatest and most important obstacle they faced was safety, as any plan that is not completely safe should not happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough for such an operation with the winds being so powerful and unpredictable at that height. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen, not helium, which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire, especially in a place as crowded as New York City. This inherent danger was another insurmountable problem with landing a dirigible there. Another obstacle was the wind itself, as a dirigible could not land unless it was weighted down with heavy lead weights, which also was not safe for the people walking freely on the streets below. These fundamental safety and practical problems are the definitive reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building.
1566	16399	6	3	In an attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was because of safety reasons. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium, which was the safer alternative. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the powerful and unpredictable winds on top of the building. The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas presented a legal challenge. Having to tie up the dirigible to the building would be illegal. But as years passed on the idea of using the mooring mast died out leaving there to be no more obstacles to face, as the plan was ultimately abandoned.
1567	16400	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author stated, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" Dirigibles used hydrogen more often than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk. If a dirigible were to catch fire or crash, it would be very dangerous over a populated area like Manhattan. Another obstacle was nature. The author wrote, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would be too much for a dirigible to handle, making stable docking nearly impossible. A final reason stating why they couldnt dock was because it was against the law. The story stated, ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal to dock, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. The dirigibles faced many obstacles that didnt allow them to dock at the Empire State Building, rendering the ambitious plan impractical."
1568	16401	6	3	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling, making them seem ideal for long-distance travel. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City, which highlighted their immense size. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing area in the densely built city. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself; the winds on the top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These powerful gusts made it impossible for a large, buoyant aircraft to remain securely fastened, ultimately preventing the mast from ever being used as intended.
1569	16402	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps to dock there. At first Al Smith, who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building, was really trying to win ""... the title of world's tallest building..."" against the architect building the Chrysler Building. Then Al Smith had an idea that would make his building over two hundred feet taller than the Chrysler building. Al Smith decided he would add a spire to the building to serve as a mooring mast for dirigibles. ""The Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Consequently, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made..."" to the structure. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with the experts..."" to make sure everything would be safe and in check. The builders went through such trouble and ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."" as a functional airship dock. After so much work and effort the mooring mast never got put to use because ""Dirigibles moored... at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe,"" leading to the abandonment of the concept."
1570	16403	6	3	In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they initially disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate the immense weight and pull of dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger and more secure. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed atop the building. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly over cities. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking was therefore illegal. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work, concluding the short-lived venture.
1571	16404	6	3	The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible mooring mast had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem of there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land. However there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building, causing severe damage. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building, leading to a massive disaster. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal, rendering the entire concept impractical from the start.
1572	16405	6	3	"While building the Empire State building, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The original problem was figuring out how to get the dirigible onto the building. After consulting with the Navy as well as meeting with the president of newly formed ""airship transport company,"" they devised an initial plan. After this they thought they were past the rough of it, but there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mass, they realised with the height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix this problems, and it cost over one hundred thousand dollars to make these modifications. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt, of dirigibles to dock, to stop in its tracks. Many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team. It could be very dangerous, as some gases used in dirigibles are extremely flameable. Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock, at such high altitudes, with ""constantly shifting"" air currents. All of these problems were amplified because it was even more unsafe for these problems to exist in such a populated area. The build team was able to overcome some obstacles, but some caused too many potential problems to be fixed, ultimately leading to the failure of the docking initiative."
1573	16406	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, a lot of stress would be put on the building's frame with a thousand foot dirigible held to it, so the builders would have to make many modifications to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Furthermore, safety was a paramount reason as to why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there because of the highly flammable gas, Hydrogen that is used in most dirigibles. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Finally, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents caused shifting winds, making the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, which wasn't safe for the pedestrians on the streets below. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose as a functional dirigible dock."
1574	16407	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making any stable connection nearly impossible. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic! For example the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die. These combined factors of nature, law, and safety concerns ultimately doomed the dirigible docking plan from the very beginning.
1575	16408	6	3	"While building the mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building struggled through many difficulties and issues. First they had to make sure the dirigible wouldn't tear down the framework of the building. Because the dirigible was so large and heavy the dirigible added with the wind would ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which was at the bottom. This had to be addressed, or the building would have been destroyed from the immense strain. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the buildings. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked, a process that required significant time and resources. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. This was very difficult to do, and unfortunately, it wasn't possible to build this mast so it would be safe for the public, especially given the volatile nature of the airships themselves. This eventually led to the mast never being used as a docking station, becoming instead a testament to an ambitious but unworkable vision."
1576	16409	6	3	The greatest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The violent air currents at such a high altitude created constantly shifting winds on top of the building. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the massive airship would dangerously swivel around and around the fixed point. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be stabilized by weighting down the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. This fundamental challenge of controlling the airships in the unpredictable wind proved to be an insurmountable problem for the ambitious docking plan.
1577	16410	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders had to face many obstacles while constructing the Empire State Building to be able to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders confronted issues such as safety law changes and the building's structural integrity, which were not fully considered when the idea was first conceived. After creating the plan to add a mast on top of the Empire State Building for docking dirigibles, the new airships, they finally decided to examine the defaults of the already developed plan. While the mast was being designed, architects realized that you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof,"" as a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame. When the builders were constructing their initial plan, they didn't consider the fact that the load and pull of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire structure. ""The greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The builders realized that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and since the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, the dirigible idea would not be as easy to fulfill with all of the obstacles to overcome. The obstacles the builders had to face when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building were ultimately safety laws, weather, and the building's own structural limitations."
1578	16411	6	3	"The excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the fear of such an accident occurring in a densely populated area such as New York posed a significant problem, because most international dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Another obstacle was the nature of the mooring mast itself and the violent air currents that cause sudden shifts in wind, making a stable docking procedure nearly impossible. Having a dirigible moored to the top of the Empire State Building, ""dangling high above the pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Also, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, therefore making ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The architects of the project were so excited by the novelty of the idea that they were blind to these potential difficulties from the outset. These obstacles and unsolved problems contributed to the failure of the mast, and the ambitious idea for a skyport soon disappeared and was forgotten."
1579	16412	6	3	The builders faced a lot of issues in their plan to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious and careful in building the platform to allow dirigibles to dock. The dirigibles, or blimps, were very large transportation machines that were made out of steel and cotton fabric and were filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a highly flammable substance, which meant the builders had to be careful with power and electricity supplies near the docking mast. To allow a blimp to dock over a thousand feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they needed to work on the framing of the building so that in any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse and would remain stable under the added stress. Because of all these problems and the extensive precautions the builders had to consider, making the mast functional was a failure, and the concept was left behind for the future of transportation to airplanes.
1580	16413	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the need to reconstruct the building to add the mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" making the mast itself a significant engineering challenge they had to face. Also, they had to face all of the stringent safety requirements, which became a major concern. ""Was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After they figured out what could go wrong if they docked dirigibles, the original purpose of the mast was not able to be fulfilled as planned. Another obstacle they had to face was testing their plan to dock dirigibles, which proved the concept's impracticality. ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up."" The dirigible failed in its attempt, and after this and other similar failures, the idea of docking dirigibles at the skyscraper disappeared in the late 1930s. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that ultimately rendered the mooring mast an unused architectural feature."
1581	16414	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State Building faced many safety and practical obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of it. For example, dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937, a catastrophic event that highlighted the inherent risks. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a massive dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add significant stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make expensive modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent and unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor to the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible's fragile gas cells. Clearly, there were insurmountable practical and safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building."
1582	16415	6	3	Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the building's flat roof; a specialized mast was required. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there, a substantial financial investment. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas, a regulation designed for public safety. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building the mast, rendering the ambitious concept ultimately impractical.
1583	16416	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, a stark reminder of the danger. There is no predicting that that could never happen again, especially in a crowded metropolis. The greatest obstacle in attempting to dock dirigibles there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets, wasn't practical and not safe. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind blowing the dirigible into other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell and cause a lot of damage. These combined factors made the entire venture unfeasible from the start.
1584	16417	6	3	In the passage *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof; the structure required significant reinforcement. This is saying that you need to have a solid amount of support to hold a dirigible securely. Another is that most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen not Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. So if that were to catch fire in the middle of New York City that would not be good, potentially leading to a disaster far worse than the Hindenburg. Another is the changing wind speeds would cause the dirigible to sway in the air, making a stable connection to the mast nearly impossible. This could cause issues with stability and control during the docking process. So in this passage *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders had to overcome significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, obstacles that ultimately proved too great to surmount.
1585	16418	6	3	When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced, as was the case with the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building. The number one obstacle was public safety. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building was another problem, creating unpredictable and powerful gusts. The actual building structure was a problem too, as its frame was not originally designed to handle the stresses of a moored airship. All these problems were significant, and the architects tried to work around them, and ultimately failed. Safety is important; if one person dies per trip, nobody is going to go on the balloon. Safety is important, as no safety means no business and, more critically, public endangerment. The wind was a huge problem; if the balloon won't stay still while unloading passengers, it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change to bear the load, and that is an expensive fix requiring major structural modifications. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced in their visionary but flawed plan. Maybe one day technology will advance to fix these issues, but for that era, the dream was not achievable.
1586	16419	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main problems was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which made it dangerous for a dirigible to be turning around the building above pedestrians. Another obstacle that the builders faced was that many dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State Building did not want a dirigible to catch fire above a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The final obstacle faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" ultimately rendering the ambitious docking plan unfeasible."
1587	16420	6	3	"There were many problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced when it came to dirigibles. They faced problems with ""... violent air currents"" that flow above the building. These would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock, and sway the back end while they were docked, creating a significant hazard. Another problem was that there was an ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State Building, as the maneuver would require flying at a low altitude over the city. These obstacles described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Lusted show why the spire at the top of the Empire State Building was never used to dock dirigibles as originally envisioned."
1588	16421	6	3	There were many obstacles that stood in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact the dirigible would be in relatively close proximity with pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast. In addition, there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do just that if it attached to the mast. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast. The proposed solution would be to put heavy blocks in the back, but that could cause the ship to fall on top of the pedestrians. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable and ultimately impractical to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1589	16422	6	3	The obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State Building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example, a U.S. Navy dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that the owners of the Empire State Building faced numerous insurmountable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.
1590	16423	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building built two floors just for the passengers to drop off their luggage and to wait. They had a view in those floors, and since the dirigible docking idea didn't work, they wasted money on those extra rooms. They started working on the build and attempted to make dirigibles dock on the top, but they wasted a lot of time and money, and it was just a waste altogether. This ultimately demonstrated that the grand vision for a dirigible terminal was an impractical and costly endeavor from the start.
1591	16424	6	3	The Empire State Building was designed to become the world's tallest building, with a few tricks up its sleeve, including its originally planned function as a mooring mast for dirigibles. Unfortunately, many problems lay in the way of turning this theory into reality. One obstacle the constructors of the Empire State Building faced was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The use of this volatile gas posed a dangerous threat to the safety of civilians in New York City. Another problem which was encountered with the building was the wind. The violent air currents at such a great height meant the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast; the prospect of these dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. A third problem the builders had was the legality of the issue of mooring ships to the buildings. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With this law in place, it would have been impossible for ships to legally moor. Although the builders had good intentions, they ultimately failed to realize the impractical reality of the situation.
1592	16425	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, as mentioned, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The difficulty in having stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, placing immense strain on the entire structure. Wind was another significant obstacle that the builders had to overcome. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. And even if the dirigible were to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these lead weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, creating a serious public hazard."
1593	16426	6	3	Building the mooring mast was not an easy task; creating this futuristic design carried a lot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long, so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously. It was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there was also a great danger of the dirigible crashing or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York. Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State Building was modified and strengthened so it could support the dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the dirigibles vigorously, which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once, which didn't end up working out after all. There had already been cases of dirigibles crashing, such as the Hindenburg, and an accident over a densely populated area would be horrific. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a mooring mast to dock dirigibles was quietly retired.
1594	16427	6	3	When the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles first surfaced, it seemed like a brilliant idea. But as time and construction went on, the surmounting obstacles that arose made the idea of a mooring dock stay just an idea. When the mooring mast was finished, the obvious safety hazards stopped it from fulfilling its purpose. The greatest physical hazard was the nature of the mast itself. The winds at that height were strong, violent, and constantly shifting. Even if the dirigible was tethered down, the back of the ship would be swiveled around the mooring mast by the powerful gusts. Another hazard was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that they could not take that risk. A final obstacle that arose was a law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas; this law made it illegal for a ship to even come near the building, rendering the mast functionally obsolete from a legal standpoint.
1595	16428	6	3	The obstacles the engineers faced were that of any ambitious builder. You have to think about how high is too high, consider wind conditions, the sturdiness of the frame, and the payroll for the engineers. Although Al Smith did not run into all of these problems, he did have to rethink the mooring mast and whether it was a good idea. Putting a thousand-foot airship dangling from a building 1,250 feet in the air presented insurmountable safety and practical challenges. Al Smith sought to create a landmark for the U.S., but he perhaps should not have put a non-usable mooring mast at the top of the iconic skyscraper.
1596	16429	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This means that any little spark inside the dirigible would send it up in flames, creating a significant fire hazard. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents."" This proves that having the dirigible docked up there would be very dangerous and would call for weights to be used to anchor the back of the dirigible securely. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This symbolizes that it is against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area, posing a legal barrier. Ultimately, the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ignored due to these combined challenges."
1597	16430	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many natural opposition in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the building. Nature forces were a total threat to the idea of the dirigibles landing on the Empire State building: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which wouldn't be safe for the people getting in and off the dirigible because the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making boarding perilous. Other opposition to the idea was that most dirigibles that came from outside the U.S didn't use helium, but hydrogen which is highly flammable and risked the life of the people who lived around the Empire State building in the event of an accident. Also the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over the urban areas, which made the docking of the ships in the Empire State building illegal. The builders of the Empire State building confronted both natural and social opposition to the landing of the ships, leading to the concept's abandonment."
1598	16431	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the structure had to be modified and significantly strengthened. This cost them over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications, a substantial financial investment at the time. They had to make these structural modifications so the dirigible could dock safely and the mast could withstand the associated stresses. All in all, these are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock, highlighting the practical and financial difficulties involved.
1599	16432	6	3	The builders had many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was they had to make sure the building was high enough to reach the airships' cruising altitude. They also had to make sure the building was durable enough to handle the physical strain of a large, moored aircraft. These structural requirements were fundamental to the docking plan. Those are some of the obstacle they had to overcome to allow the dirigibles to dock there, demonstrating the significant engineering challenges presented by the ambitious idea.
1600	16433	6	3	"When allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building they were faced with many obstacles. One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was the Empire State Building was not well structured to hold a dirigible of several hundred feet and the building's structure would need to be modified to at least sixty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle the builders had faced was the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium so hydrogen was very flammable. This meant they didn't want something bad to take place above the building and in a ""populated area like downtown New York."" The last main obstacle they had to face was the mooring mast was always affected by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on it, causing danger to people in the town of New York. Those were the few obstacles the builders had on allowing dirigibles to dock near the Empire State Building, which ultimately prevented the plan from becoming a practical reality."
1601	16434	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of problems in building the mooring mast. How would they be able to allow dirigibles to dock there? High winds and city laws stood in the builders' way, creating significant challenges. The frame of the building had to be reinforced so it would not fall to the ground under the strain of a moored airship. The landing gear date had to be postponed due to building schedules and these necessary structural changes. When a dirigible did try to land, it couldn't successfully dock. The air streams around the skyscraper were too much for it to handle safely. In the end, the idea was unrealistic. High winds and laws prevented the mooring mast from ever being used for its intended purpose.
1602	16435	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle was safety for pedestrians and the building itself. Most of the dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable and highly volatile. They didn't want the dirigible to explode and fall over pedestrians and catch the whole building on fire, which would have been a catastrophic event. This paramount concern for public welfare and structural integrity was the main obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to let dirigibles dock there.
1603	16436	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Tarshis, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Tarshis says in the excerpt ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space, which was not readily available. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the other practical reasons why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof without considering the structural implications. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add immense stress to the building's frame. So the builders of the Empire State Building did not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of their building, also because of everything that could happen to the building and the people below."
1604	16437	6	3	"According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. A large dirigible moored at the top of the building would add tremendous stress to the building, and ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" had to be made to accommodate the stress. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, high winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast in an unpredictable manner. According to the article, dirigibles could be weighted down to prevent this, but it is too unsafe for pedestrians on the streets below. There was also the critical issue with docking dirigibles that use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In May 6, 1937, a hydrogen dirigible was destroyed by fire and according to the excerpt, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that if the accident was at downtown New York, it would have made the densely populated area too unsafe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for there were too many obstacles for such an accomplishment to be made safely."
1605	16438	6	3	"The Mooring Mast, from the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Tarshis, describes how the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. Building a mast is more complicated than you would think; they had to take a lot of things into consideration like the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Just when the builders thought they were done, Al Smith adds a 250-foot Mooring Mast to the top of the Empire State Building, introducing new engineering challenges. The builders had to go through a lot of obstacles and challenges to complete this project, but they did ultimately construct the mast, even if it was never used for its intended purpose."
1606	16439	6	3	One of the primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which made the docking process perilous and unpredictable. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, demonstrating the immense difficulty of stabilizing the massive airships in such an exposed and turbulent environment. This fundamental challenge of controlling the dirigibles in high winds proved to be a significant and persistent problem for the ambitious docking plan.
1607	16440	6	3	The workers that were building the extravagant Empire State Building went through several obstacle courses in their plan to dock airships. One of the obstacle courses involved having the blimp sit on top of the building. Since the blimp was only held by one cable cord, it was applying significant stress to the building's structure because the blimp was pretty heavy. Another obstacle was nature; since the Empire State Building was so high up, the wind was excruciatingly strong and unpredictable. The last obstacle they had to overcome was the type of gas they used inside the blimps. If they used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable substance like in the German blimps, it could have been disastrous, adding a critical layer of risk to the entire endeavor.
1608	16441	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included an existing law. This law prohibited dirigibles from mooring at the building because it forbade airships from flying too low over urban areas. The regulation would make it illegal for a ship to even tie up to or even approach the mooring mast, creating a legal barrier that was as formidable as any physical one. This legal restriction ultimately prevented the realization of the dirigible docking concept from the very beginning.
1609	16442	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which would make it hard for the dirigibles to be tethered securely to the mast. Another problem they faced was the existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a significant legal hurdle. Also, the specialized equipment needed to dock the airships safely hadn't even been installed, leaving the practical execution of the plan unresolved. These combined issues of nature, law, and logistics ensured the dirigible docking plan was never truly viable.
1610	16443	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. If the builders had decided to do that, then the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add immense stress to the building's frame, which could also jeopardize the lives of all the tourists who visited and everyone who worked there. There was also the fact that the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This meant the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, and such a substantial engineering change didn't come cheap; in fact, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. In all, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a failure, with safety being a paramount concern since most dirigibles outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The end result is that today the rooms that were set aside for passenger baggage are now the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden, and the highest observation deck intended for arriving passengers has never been open to the public.
1611	16444	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary obstacle was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building without causing structural issues. A thousand-foot dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add immense stress to the building's frame. This load, combined with the wind pressure, would have to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To manage this, the builders had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to reinforce the structure. Another critical reason was the force of nature. As stated in the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"" creating violent and unpredictable air currents. This made it impossible to securely tether the massive airship; using lead weights to anchor it was not a viable solution as they would be dangling dangerously high above pedestrians on the streets below. A final, insurmountable obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This regulation made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Collectively, these formidable obstacles destined the iconic mooring mast to never fulfill its intended purpose, remaining instead as a historical footnote."
1612	16445	6	3	"In attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, the project's planners encountered many complex problems. One fundamental problem, as highlighted in the text, was the immense structural stress a dirigible would impose. The excerpt notes, ""A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" If the dirigible dock were to be built, it would necessitate reinforcing the entire building's framework to prevent a potential collapse, a costly and complex engineering challenge. Another serious problem was the type of gas used for lift; most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen instead of the safer helium. Therefore, since hydrogen is so volatile, they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area like midtown Manhattan. A more persistent problem was the weather, specifically the powerful wind at such a great height. The air currents were so violent that the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. Dirigibles usually landed in open fields where they could be anchored by lead weights, but according to the excerpt, dangling these weights high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, the most major problem was a city law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even though the dirigible dock was a great promotional idea, too many significant problems were in conflict with the mooring mast for it to go into full effect. On the brighter side, the mast's construction did contribute to making the Empire State Building the tallest in the world at that time."
1613	16446	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary problem was the structural reinforcement required; they had to strengthen the rest of the building significantly in order to support the mast at the very top. This process was very costly, as the author states that ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" to handle the additional loads. Another major problem in the attempt to dock dirigibles was the fierce winds encountered at the top of the skyscraper. The air currents were very violent that high up, making stable docking nearly impossible. The text explains that ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" a situation that would not be safe for the people on the streets of the city below. Finally, the laws of the city directly interfered with the plan for the mooring mast. The law clearly stated that it was illegal for an airship to fly too low over urban areas. If a dirigible had been able to dock on the mooring mast, it would have been breaking this law by its very presence. Faced with these combined challenges of cost, safety, and legality, the builders of the Empire State Building saw their ambitious plan never actually follow through."
1614	16447	6	3	"The plan to use the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles faced various formidable obstacles, with safety being the most important concern. Dirigibles from outside the United States commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable and volatile gas, instead of the safer but less available helium. After a German dirigible was tragically destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building saw the true dangers of a similar accident occurring in downtown New York. The successful use of the mooring mast presented another significant obstacle. The powerful winds at such a high altitude made the delicate process of docking extremely difficult. Once docked, the dirigibles would have to dangle precariously above pedestrians, a situation that was, as noted, ""neither practical nor safe."" Furthermore, an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas created additional legal problems. After the airship Los Angeles famously failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds, the owners began to fully appreciate the array of unsolved problems. By the late 1930's, the ambitious idea for a skyscraper dirigible port had, as the text states, ""quietly disappeared."""
1615	16448	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hindered by many obstacles the builders had to face. Firstly, the combined stress of the dirigible's load and the significant wind pressure posed a serious threat to the building's structural frame. The builders addressed this initial problem by making ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework."" After the mast's construction, however, two more profound obstacles arose. The first was the fuel source; most dirigibles of the era used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was catastrophically destroyed by fire, the builders realized the immense danger in letting a similar accident happen in densely populated New York City. The mast's greatest obstacle, however, was described as ""nature itself."" Since the winds on top of the building were always shifting due to turbulent air currents, the back of a docked dirigible would swivel uncontrollably around the mast. Builders considered using lead weights to stabilize the airship, but the idea of dangling these weights high above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe."" The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Though the builders and owners were able to overcome the first obstacle presented by the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the subsequent and more complex obstacles ultimately prevented the mooring mast from ever fulfilling its intended purpose."
1616	16449	6	3	The people who built the Empire State Building had many problems building it, particularly concerning its intended function as an airship terminal. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing area. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. This visionary concept, however, was fraught with practical difficulties from the outset. The immense height of the building presented a unique set of challenges that had to be overcome, though the fundamental idea of a skyscraper airship port ultimately proved unworkable.
1617	16450	6	3	Some of the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that they were docked by means of an electric winch, which would haul in a line from the front of the ship and then tied into the mast. Also the dirigible's body could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and get off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. This procedure required immense precision and calm weather conditions to be executed without incident. Finally the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, to better understand the complexities involved. Despite this careful research, the practical application at such a great height in an urban environment remained a significant hurdle.
1618	16451	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were cost and safety. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to fix this new situation and it would cost a considerable amount of money. Another obstacle was that most of the countries outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, creating a potential fire hazard. Another obstacle was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which made docking maneuvers unsafe. These were some of the major obstacles they had to go through, and they ultimately proved too great to overcome for the ambitious plan to be realized.
1619	16452	6	3	In order to build the Empire State Building, some of the workers endured problems while constructing it, especially concerning the innovative mooring mast. The engineers and architects consulted first with the experts to understand these challenges. The obstacles the builders had to face were, one, the height. It was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the building's frame. Wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up, the back part of the ship would sway from the wind. In the end, the author says or implies that the dirigible dock was never meant to be a practical reality because of all the insurmountable problems that came with it.
1620	16453	6	3	The future of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building became unrealistic when issues of safety came forward and when test runs did not go as planned. Some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium which could be flammable, posing a grave risk. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse an accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. By placing a dock in the heart of New York City, it was risking the lives of too many passengers and citizens. When the dock was in place at the top of the Empire State Building, two dirigibles tried landing but both times it was a failure. There were several problems with landing, one being the wind. The dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. These combined dangers ultimately stopped this ambitious plan from ever happening.
1621	16454	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles were the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircraft. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add significant stress to the building's frame. The immense load and pressure had to be properly transmitted down to the base of the building, and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to the steel framework to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is highly flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a docked dirigible had to be weighted down or it would spin around the mast, and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Ultimately, design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders."
1622	16455	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Because Al Smith wanted to build a structure larger than the Chrysler Building, he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. The building's steel frame had to be significantly modified before the construction of the mooring mast could begin because just putting the mast on top would stress the frame and potentially bring it down. Another critical issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down safely when on flat land, but not on top of a towering building where there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong, such as a dropped weight or a snapped line. There was even a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas, which the builders had to work their way around. The biggest obstacle seemed to be ensuring safety for the people both on the ground and on the airship.
1623	16456	6	3	In the process of building the Empire State Building the architects had many obstacles. One main obstacle was making the foundation and the overall structure strong enough. Another was the wind factor. They had many problems in the building of the Empire State Building. In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building they had to strengthen the whole foundation and the building's frame. If a dirigible docked before these modifications, the whole building would twist and sway dangerously. Another problem was the wind. The wind coming off of other buildings would create turbulent gusts that could spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed, making docking perilous. Even though they faced many obstacles, they successfully completed the Empire State Building, though the dirigible docking concept was never practically realized.
1624	16457	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to add a dirigible docking station at the top of the building. As it says in the text, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind could cause a serious safety hazard by spinning the tail of the docked dirigible around violently. Also, dirigibles are highly flammable due to the lifting gas they used. If an explosion such as the Hindenburg disaster took place at the top of the Empire State Building it would have been catastrophic. Attempting to moor a dirigible at the top of the building was not only dangerous: It was illegal. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The fact that mooring a dirigible was illegal and extremely dangerous was not the only obstacle that builders faced. It was also a daunting engineering task. Builders would have to learn new technologies for operating the system, perhaps by studying methods at the U.S. Naval Air Station. After researching, builders realized that they would have to strengthen the building's frame. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Ultimately, the obstacles the builders faced proved to be enough reason to never use the mooring mast for its intended purpose."
1625	16458	6	3	In their attempts to try and build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got on and off of dirigibles. While anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to disembark, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel in the wind, which could endanger the passengers on the narrow gangplank and could possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or destroyed against the mast. Another difficulty was the way the mast itself was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, a narrow spire, so it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform-like design, so instead of hovering dirigibles could land fully, it would have allowed for more stability during passenger transfer and refueling operations. These overlooked challenges contributed to the infeasibility of the entire docking scheme.
1626	16459	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. The builders had to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment used in building mooring masts, land dirigibles service and a workable arrangement, and modify the building for support of the mast. In preparation to the construction of the mast the architects first took tours of the equipment at the Naval Air Station in Lakehurst to better understand the requirements. The builders also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered their services across the Pacific Ocean to discuss operational logistics. A workable arrangement had to be created, which proved to be a complex task. It was difficult and tedious to figure, ""on some safe way of mooring ships to this mast,"" requiring extensive planning and design iterations. The foundation of the building had to be considered as well because, ""the architects could not simply dropping mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" without ensuring structural integrity. Over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be performed, reinforcing the steel structure to bear the new loads. All of these were significant obstacles in the way of architects building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, ultimately challenging the feasibility of the entire venture."
1627	16460	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the architects faced was the building's frame. They needed to design the landing area so that if a dirigible landed there, it wouldn't add too much stress to the building's frame, which was not originally intended for such dynamic loads. Another problem was the stress of the load, and wind pressure. In paragraph four, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem, posing a major engineering challenge. Finally, after the builders figured out that they needed to make various adjustments, also to strengthen the building's steel frame, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made,"" which is a lot of money and represented a substantial financial hurdle. Those are the key obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, demonstrating the immense difficulties of the project."
1628	16461	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the Empire State Building even taller, reaching 1,250 ft. Secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as an obstacle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph three, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"". Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"". There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast, creating a significant safety hazard. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."
1629	16462	6	3	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it was mentioned that architects faced challenges when attempting when allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium for lift, which was more readily available but far more dangerous. In the excerpt it said that hydrogen is highly flammable and if something went wrong it could be a huge problem in a highly populated area like New York, risking a catastrophic disaster. The main problem they faced was the nature itself. It said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The dirigible has the potential to swivel around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous, making a safe and stable docking procedure nearly impossible to guarantee. These significant challenges are what ultimately led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originally planned, rendering it an architectural novelty rather than a functional port."
1630	16463	6	3	It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the mast which sounds like a long and complicated process, involving numerous consultations and design revisions. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out initially, generating public excitement. Builders started construction and proceeded for some time. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. Hydrogen is highly flammable and too dangerous to use in such a highly populated area, presenting an unacceptable risk. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible to execute safely and reliably. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway, prohibiting low-altitude flight over cities. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction, thus saving considerable effort and resources.
1631	16464	6	3	"The first obstacle that the can builders faced was the fact that the idea of the empire State building being the tallest construct in New York City had been shattered, which complicated their initial plans. This led them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded. When the design to make the construct of the plan was complete they begin to face more potential problems. The first being it was not logical or probable to ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (line @NUM1) For, in doing this the amount of stress it would induce on to the frame would be monstrous, hence, it was concluded the stress would have to be transmitted through the building's foundation, which to the builders dismay was 11 hundred ft. below. This resulted in @MONEY1 worth of modifications to the foundation to ensure structural integrity. Another obstacle that was faced was the wind pressure. ""Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (line @NUM2), demonstrating a persistent and dangerous challenge that ultimately contributed to the plan's impracticality."
1632	16465	6	3	"While constructing the Empire State Building the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. To begin, the dangers of allowing dirigibles that were made outside of the United States posed a significant safety risk. Many non-American dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is much more flammable compared to the United States helium balloons. To avoid a repeat of the explosion of a dirigible L¸sted states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above.. Downtown New York."" Furthermore, @CAPS1, the winds at the top of the building were too wild to attach a dirigible safely to the top. The author clarifies, ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around... the back could be weighted down with lead weights, but using these was neither practical nor safe."" This shows that in order to have the ship still enough to be able to moor it was dangerous and unfeasible. Lastly, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the building to be able to moor. Marcia Amidon L¸sted says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This makes the possibility of landing a dirigibles on the Empire State Building illegal, presenting a final and insurmountable legal barrier to the entire endeavor."
1633	16466	6	3	One of the obvious reasons is the height of all this taking place, which introduced a unique set of challenges. The strong, always changing winds were a problem because it would make the back of the blimp sway from side to side, creating instability during any attempted docking procedure. Another problem was trying to stop the swaying of the ship; they considered putting lead weights on the craft, but hanging heavy weights above pedestrians is not safe at all and posed an unacceptable public hazard. Another reason was that it was against the law to fly aircraft too low to the ground, which directly prohibited the close maneuvering required for mooring. These are just some of the reasons why this wasn't going to work, illustrating that the concept was flawed from both a practical and a legal standpoint.
1634	16467	6	3	Even beginning to build the dock of the empire state building was a mistake from the outset. What first appeared to be a worthwhile and realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed, risking catastrophe over a densely populated city. One obstacle the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians, creating a clear legal impediment. Another obstacle they faced was the unsafeness of it all. The winds at that height are constantly different and could cause the dirigibles to move around unpredictably, making a secure connection nearly impossible. Having airships dock at the empire state building was therefore potentially dangerous as well as illegal, a combination of factors that doomed the project to failure.
1635	16468	6	3	The builders of the empire State building faced a lot of obstacles in their plan to accommodate dirigibles. One problem they had was when and if they landed, getting an area for the people to get on and off safely and efficiently. They had to make the platform bigger also to accommodate the size of the airships and the potential flow of passengers. When the dirigibles landed it was typically because they needed more fuel; @CAPS1 it would only be a couple hours they were stopped, which made the entire operation a brief and logistically complex refueling stop rather than a practical passenger terminal. This limited utility, combined with the other significant challenges, ultimately rendered the mooring mast an unused feature of the iconic skyscraper.
1636	16469	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders experienced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the builders could not just drop a mooring mast on the top of the building. As the text explains, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This structural stress was a significant engineering challenge. Another problem the workers faced is they would have to change the entire design of the building to meet the accommodations of the mooring dock, requiring substantial modifications. The largest reason why the dock did not work out was safety. The author writes ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" This means that the dirigibles were highly flammable, and if one exploded over the densely packed city of New York, it would have serious repercussions, potentially causing a catastrophic disaster. All of these reasons, from structural integrity to the grave safety risks, are why the ambitious plan for a mooring dock never came to life on top of the Empire State Building."
1637	16470	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was that many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" Docking dirigibles that used hydrogen, not helium, had been proven dangerous by the tragic fate of the German Hindenburg when it was destroyed in a fire, and if anything like that occurred over New York the results would be horrible. A second obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was another safety concern. The point was brought up that ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it unsafe for the passengers on board the dirigible, as the airship could be thrown about unpredictably. A third obstacle faced is the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over areas such as New York. That law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, creating a legal barrier that could not be overcome. Those are the three primary obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1638	16471	6	3	"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in *The Mooring Mast*. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the building's frame, a complex process involving transmitting the immense pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidly spread to the city below, endangering countless lives. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating a hazard for pedestrians on the streets far below. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today as a monument to an unfulfilled vision."
1639	16472	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were numerous. The building's great height presented a challenge for docking an airship. Furthermore, a critical question was how the passengers would be able to get on and off the dirigible safely at such an elevation. The process of docking was also complicated by the fact that a large dirigible takes a long time to slow down and maneuver into position. The building is said to be 102 floors high with an observation deck on the 101st floor and a boarding and observation deck on the 102nd floor for the blimp passengers. Some more major obstacles that the builders faced were so intense they are hard to explain; those major obstacles included the fundamental problem of how to actually dock the blimps securely and the logistical issue of how many blimps could dock there at one time. These combined challenges proved too difficult to resolve.
1640	16473	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the architects of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems the builders encountered was that the dirigible did not have a suitable landing area. The architects concluded that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of their building, because it would add stress to its frame, so they had to strengthen and modify the entire structure to make it work. Another obstacle was the fact that most dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders realized how dangerous that could be, especially above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, where a single spark could lead to disaster. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and they knew that this idea was neither practical nor safe for the airships or the people below. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and ultimately unsuccessful from the start."
1641	16474	6	3	Dirigibles were thought of as the future of transportation, offering a new way to travel through the skies. Also known as blimps, these dirigibles were like balloons except they were made with a steel framework and had robust rubbers for the gas bags and propellers to keep control and provide propulsion. These steel balloons could ride at speeds of up to eighty miles per hour, making them a swift mode of transport for their time. The main reason why the Empire State Building couldn't dock these airships was because most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium for lift. Hydrogen is highly flammable and causes catastrophic accidents, a risk that was deemed too great for a densely populated urban area. This fundamental safety issue ultimately prevented the realization of the ambitious docking plan.
1642	16475	6	3	When the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was completed, the builders began to face problems that should have been apparent from the beginning, revealing the impracticality of their grand vision. Some of the problems faced included a law in the U.S. that doesn't let aircraft fly close to or around cities and buildings for safety reasons. This meant they wouldn't be able to have the blimps tethered to the mast anyway, as it would violate these airspace regulations. The highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind also posed a significant problem because it would be blowing the blimp everywhere, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Furthermore, the airship could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land because it wouldn't be safe having them hang over the city, posing a direct danger to the public below. With the winds being crazy, the blimp, most of them filled with hydrogen, could be punctured and set ablaze, subsequently falling towards the people on the ground. With those issues being some of the most obvious problems, some would think they wouldn't have attempted it, but those obstacles were never overcome and the mooring mast still sits unused as a monument to a failed idea.
1643	16476	6	3	"The article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 is about the Empire State Building and the ambitious expectations that people had for its unique function. In @DATE1 it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet, partly to accommodate a dirigible docking station. The point of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the Empire State Building builders were trying to make a reality, transforming the skyscraper into an airport for airships. The builders came across some fundamental obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support the dirigibles, having to add significant frame work, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the buildings frame,"" making the initial structure inadequate. Because of this added stress, ""the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" requiring substantial and costly reinforcements. Then when a dirigible was destroyed in an accident, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse it could have been if it happened in a place such as downtown @CAPS1, with falling debris and fire threatening a populous area. It is a good thing they did not proceed with the idea, thus averting a potential disaster."
1644	16477	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, challenges that proved insurmountable. The Mast was doomed to fail before it began due to a combination of technical and environmental factors. The greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety concerns, which were paramount. The hydrogen, used in most dirigibles for its lifting capability, is highly flammable and posed an immense risk. If an accident were to occur, it would happen over down town New York, a catastrophic scenario. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area,"" highlighting the grave danger involved. Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles to the successful use of the Mast, as the weather conditions at that height were unpredictable. Violent air currents and high winds made it difficult, if not impossible, to fly a dirigible near the building safely. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" creating a hazardous and unstable environment for docking. The Mooring Mast was doomed to fail before they began building it, as the fundamental challenges were too great. The greatest reasons for its failure were the unpredictable air currents and the overriding safety concerns regarding the flammable gas. The dirigibles were never able to land there, and the mast remains a testament to an unfulfilled vision."
1645	16478	6	3	"While they were attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles that proved the concept was not feasible. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area at such a great height. Al Smith thought if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, then the dirigibles would be able to anchor there to refuel and let passengers off and on, but this design was untested. Another obstacle that was faced was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was extremely flammable and a major fire hazard. The owners of the Empire State Building felt that it wouldn't be safe if the dirigible set on fire with a densely populated area right below it, risking countless lives. The greatest obstacle that was faced was the use of the mooring mast with nature itself, as the weather at the pinnacle of the skyscraper was fierce. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making a stable docking procedure impossible. The owners of the Empire State building believed that if something went wrong, then the dirigible would be dangling precariously above pedestrians on the street. This was very unsafe, and these combined risks led to the abandonment of the plan."
1646	16479	6	3	"Many obstacles took place while builders of the Empire State building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the blimps docking on the building would be too much, as the immense force of a large airship attaching to the mooring mast posed a significant structural risk. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". Another problem was that dirigibles were highly flameable and in such a highly populated area of New York it ""was neither practical nor safe"". Laws against airships flying too low over urban areas worked against the idea but two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped, proving the concept's impracticality and leading to its ultimate abandonment."
1647	16480	6	3	"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was hieght. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so, pushing the limits of contemporary engineering. Also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author States, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; ""they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in Building the tallest building, The Empire State building, a testament to their perseverance and skill."
1648	16481	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles, ""enormous steel framed balloons"" commonly called blimps, dock there. One of the main issues was the pressure on the building caused by the dirigibles. As said in the excerpt The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, by @ORGANIZATION2, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications were made to strengthen and accommodate for this new situation of dirigibles, yet these efforts ultimately proved insufficient for the ambitious plan to become a regular, safe practice."
1649	16482	6	3	One obstacle the builders of the Empire state Building in attempt to allow dirigibles was, the stress from the mass & the dirigible and wind pressure would all be transmitted to the buildings foundation. The frame of the building would have to be strengthened to accommodate the new situation. There were also safety reasons. Since most states used hydrogen in stead of helium and hydrogen is flammable. If something were to happen and the dirigible was to catch fire. The fire could destroy New York City since it's so densely populated. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Plus it was nearly impossible for pilots to maintain a stable position long enough for a safe docking procedure to be completed.
1650	16483	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon L¸sted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" These combined factors ensured the dirigible docking plan was never realized."
1651	16484	6	3	There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there: the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the proposed dock would be situated directly above the crowded streets of downtown New York, there is a significantly higher risk of a catastrophic explosion due to the population density. Secondly, nature itself was a great obstacle. There were many powerful winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, creating a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around uncontrollably and hitting another building or structure. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would simply not be safe, and the entire ambitious idea would ultimately be dropped. For these reasons, the many obstacles the builders faced proved insurmountable, and the plan was abandoned.
1652	16485	6	3	"The architects had their hands full when building the addition to the Empire State Building. There were several obstacles that needed to be overcome when they started building, such as making sure the dirigibles were safe enough while also taking into consideration the winds that are constantly changing. These problems were part of why the plans were put to a halt. Certain weather conditions were a big part of the safety procedures that took place. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The powerful winds would make the massive ship sway back and forth dangerously, which would be extremely dangerous for both the airship and the building. Another significant problem was that many foreign ships ran on hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and that would be a high risk over a city. ""Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Ultimately, these combined challenges prevented the docking concept from becoming a practical reality."
1653	16486	6	3	The builders had to go through many obstacles in their attempt to allow the dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building. The first thing that was a problem was getting the airship safely to the top of the towering structure. They said the wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there without it popping or being damaged. There was also the critical issue of public safety with it being up there. There was already a precedent for disaster from another dirigible catching on fire, which highlighted the dangers. The hydrogen gases inside are really flammable and that would make a really big problem over a populated city. The last thing that they had to consider was the legal restriction that Airships were not permitted to fly too low. For all those compelling reasons, they had to carefully consider the immense challenges in their attempt to allow the dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building, and the plan was ultimately deemed unfeasible.
1654	16487	6	3	"Having the Empire State Building dock and hold dirigibles brought up some hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast; Al Smith knew that the mast would put too much pressure on the building frame, presenting a structural concern. Another was the balloon itself; besides the U.S., most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium. The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded downtown New York area, because hydrogen was much more flammable and volatile. A third obstacle was the winds, as said ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making stable docking nearly impossible. It was also illegal to fly, hold, or dock an aircraft so close to the ground in an urban center. The docking and holding of the dirigibles at the Empire State Building brought many issues and dilemmas, making it profoundly hard to carry out such an ambitious idea for such a tall building in the heart of the city."
1655	16488	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example was that the architects had to address the potential problem of the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law clearly would prohibit and make it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" for landing. Dirigibles were designed to be ""moored in open landing fields"" and ""could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Another example of an obstacle was the potential risk to passenger and resident safety. The reason the landing of dirigibles was a potential threat was that ""most dirigibles from outside United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks tragically confirmed ""when the German dirigible 'Hindenburg' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Also, another obstacle of placing a mooring mast among one of the world's tallest buildings was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the unpredictable winds the dirigible could sway and ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating an uncontrollable hazard. Faced with these formidable and interconnected problems, the architects of the Empire State Building ultimately found the obstacles of constructing a mooring mast to be too great to overcome."
1656	16489	6	3	"Throughout the short story The Mooring Mast, the builders faced many obstacles to complete their vision. For example the workers had to design a mast that would take ""the stress of the dirigible's load"" (@NUM1). The cable at the top was stated to not be able to maintain the stress the dirigible would produce, so the engineers had to develope a new solution to distribute the weight of the dirigible evenly. This cost them time and money due to the massive hight of the empire state building, requiring extensive and expensive modifications to the structure. the architects also had to do extra research to develope the mast. The workers took tours of the U.S. Naval Air Station and met with the president of the airship transport company just so they could be sure the dirigibles would land in a safe secure way. These obsticles had to be faced in order to produce their unrealistic dream, ultimately demonstrating the ambitious yet impractical nature of the entire endeavor."
1657	16490	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building had many @CAPS1. One of these @CAPS1 was trying to get the frame of the building to support dirigible, ""The stress of dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the frame."" This required significant structural reinforcement to handle the immense forces involved. Another problem faced by the builders was that there was a law against aircraft going that low, this was stated @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas."" The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The violent winds that high up would have caused the dirigibles to be unable to moor, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast."" These were the @CAPS1 the builders faced, a combination of legal, structural, and environmental challenges that proved insurmountable."
1658	16491	6	3	The Empire State Building was to be the tallest building ever made. At the top, was to be an accesable docking station for dirigibles called mooring masts. The idea of haveing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building caused the whole building to be modified. It costed over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obsticles like the modifications. Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save, creating a significant public hazard. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise, rendering the expensive mast a monument to a failed vision.
1659	16492	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in @LOCATION1, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below, demanding an unprecedented engineering effort. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, presenting a final, legal barrier to the plan's feasibility.
1660	16493	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced @CAPS1 obstacles in allowing Dirigibles to dock. The most blatant one was the height at which they would dock. Al Smith states ""The Empire State would reach the height of @NUM1 feet,"" @CAPS1 Dirigibles from outside the U.S. Were extremly Flammable. If one caught fire while moored to the top of the Empire state building the results would have been catastrophic because it would happen over a densly populated area. Another obstacle was wind. If the ship was tethered to the mast the back of it would constantly Swivel around. USing led weights to secure the back would not be safe or practical, posing a grave danger to the city streets far below. The last one was a law that made flying a dirigible too low over a urban area illegal. No Ship would be allowed to fly over downtown New York, which ultimately sealed the fate of the ambitious docking scheme."
1661	16494	6	3	Al Smith faced many obstacles in designing and building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building, most of which should have been realized before the mast was even built. One of the obvious obstacles was the constant change in wind speed and direction at such a high altitude. The back of the blimp would not be tied down, therefore swinging around wildly in the sky and making a secure connection nearly impossible. Another significant obstacle would be the structural design of the mast itself. This was critically important because if designed wrong the mast would put immense stress on the building's framework and could cause a lot of damage to the structure. Their was also a specific law prohibiting airships from flying too low in densely populated urban areas, with New York being a prime example of such an area. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some blimps, particularly those from outside the United States, were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable and posed a grave fire risk. Al Smith and his architects should have realized and thoroughly discussed these fundamental issues before constructing an unusable structure. If this was properly discussed beforehand, a great deal of time and money would have been saved on the ill-fated project.
1662	16495	6	3	In this excerpt The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lùsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstical was to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, but they overcame that with the desion to add a top or a hat to the building, which became the mooring mast. They then had to accomidate with the new situation that new modifications had to be done so that the dirigible would not add stress to the buildings frame, since the steel frame of the building could not with stand the load and wind pressure that would transmitt nearly two hundred feet below to the foundation. The biggest obstacles that led to the fate of the mast was the fact of, since most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was very flammable, and they could not have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle though because, of the constant shifing winds and powerful updrafts. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but with them dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not safe or practical for anyone below. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier. These are the obsticals that builders faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building, ultimately dooming the venture.
1663	16496	6	3	"Marcia Amidon Lùsted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would remain motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire State Building are tempted to dock dirigibles over a thousand feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature; the winds in the airspace twelve hundred feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up."" It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air over the city. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build a one thousand foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of these insurmountable safety hazards."
1664	16497	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by. Marcia Amidon Lùsted, the Al Smith wanted to make the tallest building in New York. He had made the building very tall, 1,046 feet tall to be exact, but then, the Empire State Building was made taller, reaching 1,250 feet. It was basically a competition to see who was to have the tallest building in New York, a race for architectural supremacy. A mooring mast was put on top of each building for more height, serving a dual purpose. Although, the builders did not account for the dangers posed by the balloons, or dirigibles that pass in the air. Dirigibles are highly flammable, and if they so happen come in contact with a mooring mast, it could be destroyed, just like before, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937,"" a tragic event that highlighted the risks. The mast could have caused huge chaos to New York if it did damage upon a dirigible passing in the air, making the entire concept a perilous one from the start."
1665	16498	6	3	The greatest reason was one of safty: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable, creating a significant risk of explosion or fire. The greatest obstacle to the practical use of the mooring mast, however, was nature itself. The wind conditions on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violen air currents and unpredictable weather patterns at that altitude. These powerful and variable winds made it extremely difficult for any airship to approach the mast safely, let alone remain tethered to it for any length of time. This combination of a flammable lifting gas and uncontrollable natural forces rendered the mooring mast an impractical and ultimately failed endeavor.
1666	16499	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to just drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add significant stress to the building's frame, a considerable engineering challenge. Though this was an obstacle, the architects spent over @MONEY1 on structural modifications to the frame to remedy the problem, reinforcing it to handle the potential load. Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became deeply concerned that the same accident could occur over downtown @LOCATION1, endangering thousands. In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents at such a high altitude. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be safely allowed to dangle over busy city streets below. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over an urban city. This made it illegal for airships to tie up or land in this area, rendering the ambitious docking plan ultimately impractical.
1667	16500	6	3	"When building the dock for dirigibles, Al Smith was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were more obstacles than expected, revealing the plan's inherent flaws. One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles as stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence, a serious structural concern. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violent shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast; to hang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth, posing a risk to the city below. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence) which legally prohibited the operation, along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3, second sentence), creating a major fire hazard. The whole idea of a docking mast was not well thought out from both a practical and regulatory standpoint."
1668	16501	6	3	"During the time of the @DATE1's many obstacles came into play to the architects building a dirigible dock for them to land on top of the Empire State building. The builders had to face challenging situations with weather conditions at this proposed dock. The Empire State building was so high that ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" creating a treacherous environment for docking. The weather conditions that were occurring high above this 1,250 ft building made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock themselves, making the outcome fundamentally unsafe for any attempt. Builders also had to face the reality of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas""; with this law taking its action it made it explicitly illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks. The main concern of obstacles these builders faced while constructing this landing dock would be the strong and unpredictable winds that would occur. The winds were so powerful and strong that the blimp would face ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell,"" leading to potential disaster. This obstacle of weather was a huge struggle to these architects, making the dock for these dirigibles unsuccessful in its purpose. The obstacles that were faced in constructing this dock came to the outcome of dirigibles being ""given away to airplanes"" as a more viable mode of air transport."
1669	16502	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the pronounced lack of a suitable landing area in the dense urban environment. Al Smith also saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on, envisioning a new era of air travel. Also, dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast, a complex procedure at such a height. However, the practical and safety challenges of this method in the city setting proved too great. In conclusion, these are the obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced, ultimately preventing dirigibles from being successfully docked at the skyscraper.
1670	16503	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" a forward-thinking but difficult ambition. The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building which would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this initial logistical hurdle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new engineering obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building; if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add immense stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast structure itself. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goals for Al Smith much farther away. Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city, a risk that was unacceptable. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making stable docking nearly impossible. The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians and traffic below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left incomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5, a lasting legacy despite the failed docking scheme."
1671	16504	6	3	The mooring mast there where many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first thing was safety. And that states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This inherent danger was a primary concern for any operation in a city. The greatest obstacle the @CAPS1 use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The shifting winds at such a great height made stable docking nearly impossible. As a result, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Attempts to secure the vessel with lead weights were considered, but they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. These fundamental issues of combustible gas and unpredictable weather presented insurmountable challenges to the concept.
1672	16505	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included issues in safety, nature problems, and a dilemma with a law. Safety was a major concern as many dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An example of such a dirigible was the German Hindenburg, which went up in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City."" @CAPS1, nature was a big obstacle the owners faced, as the winds on top of the building constantly shifted. According to L¸sted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" @CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, ""This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Ultimately, the builders of the Empire State Building faced issues with safety, nature, and the law that collectively prevented the plan's success."
1673	16506	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 faced many problems with the attempt to allow blimps to dock their. One problem was that the already constructed frame was not strong enough for a new mooring mast for blimps, requiring significant reinforcement. A second problem is shown in the quote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents..."" (L¸sted para. @NUM1). The weather at the height of the Empire State building would throw and move blimps in violent ways when trying to dock. The push of the winds even caused the threat of blimp being blown into a spire on a surrounding building, the threat is shown in the quote ""which would puncture the dirigibles shell"" (L¸sted para @NUM2). That is what could happen if a blimp tried to tether to the building. The builders also faced the laws about flying that low over an urban area, which presented a legal barrier. All in all the builders of the Empire state building did face a many problems while trying to allow blimps access to the building, making the concept unworkable."
1674	16507	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was placing the mooring mast on the building. L¸sted states, ""The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof"" (L¸sted @NUM1). This meant that they would have to build another structure to be able to place the mooring mast, which added complexity. The second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles. L¸sted claims, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top... held by a single tether would add stress to the buildings frame (L¸sted @NUM1). The dirigibles would weigh the building down so they would have to find a way to prevent damaging the building. The architect would have ""The steelframe modified and strengthed"" in order for any dirigible to dock there, representing a significant structural challenge. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, highlighting the immense practical difficulties involved."
1675	16508	6	3	"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the Blimp would be to low. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (∂ @NUM2) ""-the back of the ship would swivel around and around-"" (∂ @NUM2) ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" (∂ @NUM2) In the end, the architects should've thought their plan through better, as the risks clearly outweighed any potential benefits."
1676	16509	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First off, there was a great safety concern. Many dirigibles from foreign countries used helium instead of hydrogen; while helium is very flammable, therefore the dirigible might explode. This inherent danger posed a significant risk to the building and the city below. Second, the wind made it very challenging to dock the dirigibles. The winds were always changing because of the violent air currents around the skyscraper, making precise maneuvering nearly impossible. Finally, there was already a law in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other problems it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles, rendering the entire venture futile from a regulatory standpoint. Those are some of the significant problems the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles at the iconic structure.
1677	16510	6	3	"In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had trouble with putting the moor mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The mooring mast would have stressed the building significantly. Because of the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure, the structural engineers would have to strengthen and modify the whole building which cost over sixty thousand dollars in additional construction. So they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was designed to be both visually striking and functionally integrated. Those were the primary obstacles in making a moor mast for the world's tallest building."
1678	16511	6	3	The obstacles the builders went through to allow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load and also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was about eleven hundred feet below. And since they had to do that, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation, requiring extensive and costly structural recalculations and reinforcements throughout the entire framework. This fundamental engineering challenge was a major obstacle in realizing the ambitious plan for a skyscraper-top dirigible port.
1679	16512	6	3	Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast was in place, the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation, creating immense structural demands. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and luggage area for the anticipated passengers. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly eleven hundred feet below, a complex engineering feat that involved reinforcing the entire core of the skyscraper to handle the unprecedented loads and stresses from above.
1680	16513	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced was that they had to modify the building's framework in order to install the mooring mast. The builders had to modify the building because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below."" That was another obstacle the builders faced. Also, the mooring mast never fulfilled its purpose because of safety concerns regarding the airships' flammable hydrogen gas. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents around the tall structure. Ultimately, the idea was neither practical nor safe for regular operation."
1681	16514	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle involved dropping a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. If they had done this, the mast would have added a great amount of stress to the building's foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, but this was too costly. Another obstacle was the use of hydrogen rather than helium in foreign dirigibles. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, and if a dirigible had accidentally caught on fire, a great amount of damage could be caused. However, the greatest obstacle involved the harsh wind current on top of the Empire State Building. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around. The use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible down while dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, while building the mast on the Empire State Building, the architects and builders faced many obstacles that ultimately prevented its intended use.
1682	16515	6	3	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. When building the Empire State Building, the architects had to take the height of the building and the mooring mast into account. They simply could not drop a large glass and chrome mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Also, the wind currents over one thousand feet high are rapidly changing and unpredictable. An extremely large dirigible moored at the top of the building would add significant stress to the building's frame. The architects would have to modify and strengthen its steel frame for the safety of the building and its occupants. These structural changes would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a substantial sum at the time. But alas, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its destiny due to these insurmountable obstacles.
1683	16516	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced with the mooring mast were the winds and the gases used in non-American dirigibles. The wind was a significant problem because that high up, the dirigibles' back end would swivel around the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. The gases used were also a major problem because out-of-country zeppelins used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This would be disastrous if the zeppelin went up in flames over the densely populated streets of New York, risking immense loss of life and property. These combined issues of unstable winds and dangerous fuel sources presented critical safety challenges that could not be overcome.
1684	16517	6	3	During that era, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They represented a new age of air travel, with impressive capabilities for their time. They had a top speed of over eighty miles per hour and could cruise at a steady sixty miles per hour. Some of these massive airships were as long as eight hundred feet, making them truly colossal machines in the sky. Their potential for long-distance travel captured the public's imagination and spurred architectural ambitions like the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1685	16518	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles. In paragraph 6 the author states, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on."" That's one obstacle his company sought to solve. In another paragraph, it says that despite adding the mooring mast and making changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. However, the building's structure didn't really help the dirigibles much, as other practical challenges prevented the mast from ever being successfully used for its intended purpose."
1686	16519	6	3	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in the attempts of allowing dirigibles, the transportation of the future in the @DATE1's, also known as blimps to dock at the building. The biggest problem was figuring out how to make the mast work.The main obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of strong, violent air currents, the back of the dirigible would turn around and around the mast even when it'll be tied to the mast. It is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights. Because these would be dangling high above people below it would be dangerous, just in case it falls. Also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.Another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the building's foundation. This was solved by modifying the steel frame of the Building to be stronger to keep the building from collapsing. Despite these efforts, the attempts at allowing dirigibles to more at the building had many obstacles but in the end it was all for nothing because there is a law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas, rendering the entire venture impractical.
1687	16520	6	3	The Empire State building had to face the problem of how to have mast for the huelium balloon that was lighter then a blowing up balloon. The tip of the building was too long, some of the problem couldn't be solved by architects. The specific challenges involved in handling a gas lighter than air at such a significant height presented unique engineering difficulties. Ultimately, the inherent limitations of the design and the physical constraints of the location meant that some of the problem couldn't be solved by architects alone, concluding the ambitious plan.
1688	16521	6	3	The @CAPS1 faced arguments, confusment, tufe Time Building it. The project was marked by significant disputes and a general state of confusion throughout its development. These internal challenges and difficult periods during construction contributed to a complex and arduous process. Despite the turmoil, the project eventually moved forward, though not without the lasting memory of a tufe time building it.
1689	16522	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  One obstacle was the stress on the building from the dirigible.  The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was @NUM1 feet below.  So the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  The third obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around uncontrollably.  Lastly, the last obstacle with the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.  These are the many obstacles, from structural to legal, that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their.
1690	16523	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there. One of their obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen Not helium to stay in the air. If it blew up over New York the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. A second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was @CAPS1 high that there were strong wind currents. Making it difficult for the Navy's blimp the Los Angeles to come @CAPS2 the docking station at the mooring mast. Their final obstacle that they faced was the fear of the blimps going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire bursting a hole in the blimp: causing it to crash.The builders faced many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign blimp trying to dock and ends up blowing up since They are filled with hydrogen and not helium. Also since it is at such a high elevation the heavy wind currents make it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to be able to dock. Finally the fear of the blimp going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire puncturing a hole in the blimp causing it to crash, which collectively made the project unfeasible.
1691	16524	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The designers had such big plans for the building that reality was far off. One challenged they encountered was the safety of everyone involved. In the excerpt they talk about how, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). The risk of the dirigible being caught on fire was very high, posing a threat not only to the passengers and crew but also to the structure itself. If it did catch on fire not only would it harm the blimp, but also the buildings and people of New York below. Another obstacle that was in the way was mother nature herself. No one could predict the weather with certainty, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Blimps would not be able to fly close enough without the wind pushing it off course. The winds could make the aircraft fly into buildings, which could damage the design of the dirigible and cause a catastrophic accident. All in all, the challenges the designers had to overcome to build such a great building for this purpose were only a practical dream that reality soon crushed, leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan."
1692	16525	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders had many obstacles on how they could dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they had was because of the high winds present at such a great altitude. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a problem because the powerful and unpredictable winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building, potentially releasing it's flammable gases and causing a disaster. The second obstacle they faced was making the building structure strong enough to tie down the dirigibles, which were massive and exerted tremendous force. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modifyed and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). This was a problem because if they did not strengthen the steel adequately, the immense strain from the moored dirigibles would weaken the building's structural integrity over time. Those are the main two obstacles that the builders faced when building the Empire State Building @CAPS1 they could dock dirigibles, ultimately proving too difficult to overcome."
1693	16526	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders faced many obstacles in their ambitious plan. They were trying to get Dirigibles to land on the empire state building, a feat never before attempted. They faced many problems while trying to accomplish this feat, both practical and legal. If they were going to have Dirigibles land atop the building they would have to add floors to the building to accommodate the necessary equipment and passenger handling. Another one is ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" Which means they would have to waste even more money and resources on this already costly project. Then something they found out later is they couldn't even do this, in the first place due to legal matters concerning airspace rights. If they did that then they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system for violating regulations. Once they realized that I think that they realize the project was a failure and told the world ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postone too a later date the final installation of the landing gear,"" effectively ending the venture."
1694	16527	6	3	"Engineering a docking station was supposed to be a great accomplishment for the city of New York, showcasing its modernity. Unfortunately, builders faced many obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan flourish, which became apparent over time. Many engineers did not think of the hazards initially and for ""reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The greatest issue was public and structural safety. Dirigibles used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to occur again, it would be an immense danger to the densely populated city, risking countless lives.Another obstacle were the powerful winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly shifting and the backs of dirigibles would swing around and around, making a stable and secure docking procedure nearly impossible to achieve.There was also a law against low flying aircraft over urban areas. so it was illegal for a ship to ever even approach the area, creating an insurmountable legal barrier. The idea for a docking station was great, however, many obstacles were not brought up in the early @CAPS2 of planning, so the Empire State Building never came to be a dock for airships as originally envisioned."
1695	16528	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the empire State building faced in their plan for a dirigible mooring mast were substantial and ultimately prohibitive. The wind was a constant concern, as the climate was always a risk with unpredictable and powerful gusts at that altitude. Furthermore, the sheer height of the building was also a significant chalange for the builders of the empire State building, complicating both the construction of the mast and the proposed docking maneuvers for the large airships. These fundamental issues of nature and engineering proved too difficult to solve, leading to the project's failure.
1696	16529	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were significant, and for many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock there. One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most airships used to become buoyant made them highly flammable and dangerous. In a highly populated area such as New York this would be a major problem, risking a catastrophic fire. Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building's frame to handle the immense weight of the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the entire structure. Finally, the last reason would be safety. Violent winds and unpredictable air currents would make dirigibles unstable when docked to the building. There is also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal obstacle. These combined factors ensured the mooring mast was never used for its intended purpose."
1697	16530	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with the plan to dock dirigibles. The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building's structural integrity, and so a new, stronger frame was created to accomodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for these structural modifications, representing a significant financial obstacle. Another problem was public safety. A lot of dirigibles, particularly those outside of the United States, used hydrogen which is highly flammable, and different accidents like the one in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were a grave concern; if such an event were to happen in the heavily populated New York, a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents at that altitude. In open fields, lead weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having these weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" Furthermore, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. Those are the primary obstacles the builders faced when attempting to implement this feature for the Empire State Building."
1698	16531	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to suffer through many hardships in building the mooring mast and trying to dock dirigibles on it. Some of the obstacles that the builders had to overcome were related to the weather, as ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted a lot due to the violent air currents, making it extremely difficult to maintain a stable connection. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mast, the powerful wind would push the tail all the way around the mast, creating a hazardous situation. Another obstacle that the builders had to overcome was the practical issue of stabilization. They feared that the lead weights that held the dirigible down would be dangling over the edge of the building, leaving it unsafe for pedestrians on the streets below and also creating a risk for the pilot and passengers on the blimp itself. These fundamental issues of weather and public safety proved too difficult to resolve."
1699	16532	6	3	"In the excerpt of the article ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, were at the time of the construction of the Empire State Building the most advanced form of air travel. The Empire State building was erected with a mast to tether dirigibles and allow them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building, the constructors realized that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below."" Special plans therefore needed to be made to structurally support the building against the force of the blimps. The nature of the environment also was a conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles, but the idea that they ""would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" Due to violent winds at the elevation, these weights would cause the blimp to waver dangerously. The aircrafts were also at risk of colliding with the ""sharp spires of other buildings"" during its approach. In addition, a law forbade airships from ""flying low in urban areas."" For these combined reasons the Empire State Building was never used for the docking of dirigibles as originally planned."
1700	16533	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the world thought that they knew the future of air travel: dirigibles. In an attempt to keep up with the modern world, Al Smith, the lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided to top the building with a dirigible docking station. Unfortunately, during the building process, the architects faced many obstacles that stopped them from successfully completing the mooring mast. One of these problems was the sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building's structure to handle the load. Another was the flammability of hydrogen, the volatile gas used in inflating the airship, which posed a severe fire hazard. But the biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds that the dirigible would be facing at that height were very strong and unpredictable, and pedestrians on the sidewalk were put at risk by the possibility that the ship would tear off the tether it was tied to and crash into the city below. A final reason for the end of the mooring mast plan was a law that stated that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas, making the docking procedure illegal. Although the mooring mast seemed like a great idea at the time, these many obstacles collectively stopped it from having any success.
1701	16534	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building went through many obstacles, facing immense danger and grueling work hours that make me feel bad for them. At the same time, I would have been happy to be a part of something so monumental. The builders could have died doing their job, working at such extreme heights where it must have been incredibly hot and precarious. I don't think it had to be that high; they could have achieved a similar landmark status with a lower structure, thus avoiding some of the most severe risks. Those are some of the primary obstacles I think the builders went through, highlighting the tremendous challenges they endured.
1702	16535	6	3	"There were a few significant challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't just be dropped on the top of the building without consideration. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" a stress that would ultimately be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. Another obstacle was that the builders had to modify the whole building's design; the architects had designed the mooring mast and made substantial changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. The builders already had the building done, but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change it significantly. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents, which made the endeavor futile. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating an uncontrollable and dangerous situation. Ultimately, the architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing, a testament to the project's impracticality."
1703	16536	6	3	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their biggest concern was safety, particularly regarding the gases used for buoyancy. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable""(L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1). The excerpt mentions the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, which was destroyed in a catastrophic fire, noting that ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself, with the weather posing a constant threat. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM3). These unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles. Finally, there were laws put in place restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas, which presented a legal barrier. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM4). These combined factors made the ambitious docking plan unworkable."
1704	16537	6	3	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accompany this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add significant stress to the building's frame, causing the structure to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigible's large effect on the building, it would be necessary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet. The cost, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to better support the building's structure against these new forces. These financial and structural challenges ultimately proved to be major obstacles for the project."
1705	16538	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York, which created an immediate legal hurdle. Another problem the builders ran into was the high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers during unloading. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street below. Another safety issue was that most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen, which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if one ever caught on fire, a risk too great for a populated city. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe, leading to the abandonment of the plan.
1706	16539	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York, making their sheer scale a significant challenge in the dense urban environment. Another obstacle was the expanded use. New York was the lack of suitable landing area they would have, with the city's streets and buildings offering no open spaces for such large aircraft. With this Al Smith saw opportunity for his building. He would add a mooring mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea there would have to be lots of planning to address the complex logistical and safety issues involved.
1707	16540	6	3	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future, which initially made the idea of a mast seem plausible. The idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose, including the significant safety risk posed by the fact that many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast, creating an unstable and hazardous situation. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes, creating a legal barrier. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared as the plan became clearly unworkable.
1708	16541	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building, requiring substantial structural reinforcement. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions, which would make it difficult to secure an airship safely. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people walking on the streets below. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which presented a further regulatory challenge. Therefore the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome, ultimately proving the concept impractical."
1709	16542	6	3	A mooring mast could not just be put on top of the Empire State Building without considerable engineering challenges. If a thousand-foot dirigible moored to the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below, placing immense demands on the structure. The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building, creating unpredictable and dangerous conditions. The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below, and these weights were used for open landing fields where there was no risk to the public.
1710	16543	6	3	When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high, as their operational ceilings were often lower than the building's pinnacle. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem reaching the necessary altitude for a safe docking procedure. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was a safer but less available alternative. But, hydrogen is highly flameable, posing an extreme fire hazard in the heart of a major city and ultimately contributing to the abandonment of the plan.
1711	16544	6	3	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment, a risk tragically highlighted by the Hindenburg disaster. Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast, making a stable connection impossible. The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished, relegating the mast to a symbolic landmark.
1712	16545	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. Firsty, is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building, a clear demonstration of the practical dangers. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal, creating a legal barrier before any physical attempt could be made. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obsticles that couldn't be safely tackled, ultimately dooming the ambitious plan."
1713	16546	6	3	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of dirigible's load. Builders sat out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat of engineering. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" defying control. Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City, a catastrophic urban fire risk. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic. The laws prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas,"" creating a regulatory blockade. In the end, the obstacles prevented builders from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building, rendering the mast an architectural novelty."
1714	16547	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas, making the entire venture legally questionable. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely, as even skilled pilots would be at the mercy of the unpredictable gusts. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built for its intended purpose."
1715	16548	6	3	"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I lerned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger from falling debris and fire. Another obstacle was the climate. The empire State buildings top where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nerly impossible to dock a dirigible on it, with high winds and turbulence posing a constant threat to navigation. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast, challenges that ultimately proved insurmountable for safe and regular operation."
1716	16549	6	3	Some of the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were things such as how to dock a dirigible to a building, fueling and service, and how to get passengers on and off as safe as possible. They also should have thought about the structural stress that a thousand foot dirigible moored from the top of the building might do to its structure. The architects and engineers of the Empire State building consulted with experts, letting people from the U.S. naval air station take a tour of the equipment and the mooring mast, which is the anchor for the dirigible. The passengers of the dirigible could get on and off by walking down a gang plank to an open observation platform, a procedure that was envisioned but never proven in practice. In all, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's foundation to handle the anticipated loads. And some dirigibles couldn't even dock due to the challenging conditions, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unworkable.
1717	16550	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builders would want to dock the dirigibles they couldn't because there was no right area to land them, as highlighted by the fact that in New York City there was a lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature itself can take control; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable approach nearly impossible. The dirigibles, if landed on the Empire State Building, would be weighed down because ballast weights in the back would be needed to counter the lift, adding complexity to the procedure. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium, and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building, presenting an unacceptable risk to the public and the structure itself."
1718	16551	6	3	The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made to reinforce the structure. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with an illuminated inside, and the building was now 102 floors tall with this new mast addition. Even though all the hard work, the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety concerns. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles were highly flammable; after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building didn't want the same to happen in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds; even though there was a landing site, the dirigible could never be securely tied down so the passengers could get off safely. Also there was a law that stated aircraft can't fly too low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible, the vision of a dirigible terminal atop the skyscraper was never achieved.
1719	16552	6	3	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building the workers overcame countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wanted to build ""the world's tallest building."" At the same time the Empire State building was being designed, the Chrysler Building, also in New York, was finishing construction. The Chrysler Building workers decided they wanted to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles to land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely, leading to significant practical difficulties. The idea of the building acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped after these considerable challenges are recognized. The Empire State Building thus remained a symbol of architectural achievement, though its intended role as an air terminal was ultimately abandoned."
1720	16553	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles faced was making sure that the people below would not get hurt; if something happened to fall from such a great height during docking operations, someone on the streets could get seriously injured. Another obstacle faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal and regulatory hurdle that was difficult to overcome. These practical and legal concerns proved to be significant barriers to the plan's implementation. Those are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, leading to the eventual abandonment of the concept.
1721	16554	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their ambitious plan to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles were not caused by the building itself; nature played a significant part. Due to the forceful winds at the height of 1,250 feet, it was exceptionally hard for the pilots of the dirigibles to steer the ship close enough to tie it up securely. This dangerous situation occurred with the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles,"" whose captain feared the powerful wind would blow the ship onto sharp edges or other buildings in the area. Such an impact would cause the shell to get punctured, leading to a potential disaster, which is why the captain ultimately failed to attempt to reach the building in December 1930. Another significant obstacle the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, a regulation designed to protect civilians on the street from falling debris or other risks. A further complication was the structural concern that a large enough dirigible would put immense stress on the building's frame, a challenge that proved difficult to overcome. Ultimately, these combined factors prevented the visionary docking scheme from becoming a practical reality."
1722	16555	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, having the massive airships dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe for the public below. There was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which legally prohibited such operations. In addition to these obvious set-backs, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" raising serious engineering concerns. However, it is safely said that mother nature herself proposed the biggest obstacle for the builders. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it extremely difficult for pilots to keep the dirigibles securely and safely hoisted to the mast. The obstacles for the builders also became much more dangerous as they began to realize the science of the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" caught fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners and builders of the Empire State Building realized with horror that the accident could have been much worse if it happened on top of one of the most populated cities in the world. This stark revelation ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the entire docking concept."
1723	16556	6	3	It is a matter of historical record that in the future, the @CAPS1 Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose for use. The ambitious plan to serve as a docking port for airships was ultimately unsuccessful, and the building's primary function shifted away from its original design. Despite this initial failure, the structure remains a significant landmark, and it is widely recognized as the @CAPS2 Building in New York. Its iconic status was thus secured not by its intended use, but by its enduring architectural presence and cultural significance in the city's skyline.
1724	16557	6	3	The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthen the building's frame to accommodate this new situation, a significant engineering undertaking. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State Building would never work as intended. The greatest reason was safety; most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing an immense fire risk over a populated city. The biggest obstacle, however, was nature itself, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable mooring nearly impossible. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to the more practical and safer airplanes.
1725	16558	6	3	"Many problems arose with the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building that the engineers did not initially account for. While the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not originally built to withstand the stress of a moored dirigible and the additional force from the wind. Consequently, ""... modifications had to be made"" (paragraph @NUM1) to reinforce the structure. Though this obstacle was able to be overcome, many others were not. Since most dirigibles outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigible could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg, and ""owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... New York"" (paragraph @NUM2), highlighting a catastrophic safety risk. Another obstacle was a problem with a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3), which created a legal barrier. No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried but neither could tether safely to the building due to the challenging conditions. The thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the Empire State Building's top floors, once intended for airship passengers, are now a public tourist spot, marking the end of this ambitious but impractical venture."
1726	16559	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were primarily due to the specific docking procedure. The dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. This method required a secure and stable attachment point. Consequently, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof without considering the immense structural stresses and the complex logistics involved in such a high-altitude operation, which presented significant engineering challenges from the outset.
1727	16560	6	3	There were many obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building. First was that many new modifications would have to be added to the frame of the building. This is because the previous frame could not hold the extra weight of a dirigible hanging from a single cable. These structural additions would take over sixty thousand dollars plus extra time and effort. Another huge problem was safety. Winds around New York were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would lead to the blimp wrapping around the tower and possibly breaking off or worse. Not to mention that all around was a densely populated city and any accident could cause much more destruction than normal. Foreign dirigibles also used mass amounts of hydrogen, which, as proven with the Hindenburg, could explode into a massive flaming hunk of steel. This risk would be magnified with the unpredictable weather and any accident would have high human and property costs. Finally, it was illegal for blimps to fly low near a city, making the whole project illegal from the start. As you can see, there were many fundamental problems with having a blimp docking center on the Empire State Building.
1728	16561	6	3	Obstacles are faced every day, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why a dirigible could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable element, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develop. Another obstacle being faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangling these heavy weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible to execute safely and legally.
1729	16562	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted it is apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. The dirigibles themselves could be a hazard. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. In light of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown New York. Also, the dirigibles' light mass would make it a target to high, forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building, as dirigibles could not moor there due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law thwarted many of the would-be attempts of mooring these airships. Mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in ""The Mooring Mast,"" however that dream soon never had the chance to come true."
1730	16563	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that first, the mast designed to go on top of the Empire State Building was thought up just to make it the world's tallest building, not because it was necessary, so a lot of problems arose. This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, was thought to be a great opportunity to give blimps a place to anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off, as they were very unsafe and lacked a suitable landing area. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, a process that took over sixty thousand dollars to complete. After construction took place, it was then considered that if an incident, such as the Hindenburg disaster, occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. The usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a final, legal barrier to the entire concept.
1731	16564	6	3	Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of significant obstacles prevented this theory from becoming a practical reality. The builders and architects had to change the structural frame of the building completely to accommodate the immense weight and stress of the mast and a docked airship, and this structural reinforcement alone costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another serious problem was that most dirigibles outside the United States use hydrogen over the safer helium, which was highly flammable, and if a dirigible ever suffered the same catastrophic fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater disaster at the densely populated ground level. The greatest operational challenge that the mast faced was the constanly shifting winds from violent air currents around the skyscraper. This caused the back of the massive airship to swivel dangerously around the mast, even when tied to it, which posed an uncontrollable problem for a safe docking procedure. Most importantly, there was already an existing aviation law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be outright illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a forward-thinking idea, this ambitious feat ultimately couldn't be accomplished due to the insurmountable obstacles.
1732	16565	6	3	The developers of the Empire State Building had to cross many difficult obstacles in order to have a dirigible dock on the iconic skyscraper. They first needed to build a specialized mooring mast for the dirigible to dock on the Building's spire. This presented another immediate problem however because if a large dirigible docked on the building its weight and the force from winds would be to much for the building's original structure. They overcame this initial obstacle by rienforcing the building's internal supports to handle the additional load. The largest obstacle, however, and the one that ultimately defeated this idea of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building, was simply the powerful and unpredictable elements. The violent air currents and consistently high winds at that altitude made it virtually impossible for a large, buoyant dirigible to safely and steadily tether itself to the top of the empire building. For example, when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to get in range of the mooring mast but was repeatedly unable to, do to the fiercely forceful winds pushing the airship away. In the end, despite their efforts, the developers of the Empire State Building could not overcome the final obstacles presented by nature.
1733	16566	6	3	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp directly into the skyscraper. While building, Architects faced some challenging and ultimately insurmountable obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A major concern was that a dirigible moored at the very top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause immense tension on the building's structural frame. The combined weight of the airship and the wind pressure would need to be safely transferred to the buildings foundation, requiring significant reinforcement. About over sixty thousand dollars of structural modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework to manage these forces. Another construction obstacle was the roof sequencing. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote Carol Willis in her article 'The Mooring Mast,' highlighting the complex phasing. The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast. The only theoretical solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with heavy lead weights, but the risk to the public below was to much. Last but not least there was a legal line New York had drawn against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building, rendering the mast pointless. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside for passenger lounges were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd, sealing the fate of the unused mast."
1734	16567	6	3	Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for massive dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult and complex. The architects and builders had to consult with various experts as to how this novel construction should take place and whether it was structurally safe or not for a skyscraper. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and observe mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company to understand the requirements. After perfusive planning and many meetings later they would begin building this ambitious mooring mast.As for the building itself, the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building; they had to find another way, as they did not want to put excessive stress on the buildings existing frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be directly modified and reinforced, a change requiring an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Workers got to add the mast and then the entire construction concept was haulted due to the inherent danger to pedestrians below from a swaying airship, rendering all that intensive work for nothing.
1735	16568	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with immediate and serious problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary media hardship that they faced was the engineering challenge of placing a functional mooring mast on top of an already completed building. ""A thousand foot dirigible... would add tremendous stress to the building's frame,"" highlighting the core structural issue. Not to mention that a large, wind-caught dirigible would also have placed significant lateral stress on the building, risking structural integrity. Completing such a project would be extremely difficult because the building was not originally designed for docking dirigibles from its inception. This means the roof area and the top floors would need to be heavily converted to accommodate passenger waiting areas and travel operations, adding further complexity. Nature was also a formidable obstacle that builders could not control. High winds at that altitude could cause the dirigible to violently sway and become unmanageable. The heavy lead weights used to tether the dirigibles could also be a safety hazard if they fell in a densley populated area such as Midtown Manhattan. Fire was another major safety concern for the builders and city officials. The gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne were highly flammable and would again cause serious concern for public safety in a city of millions. Ultimately, the combination of all of these technical, natural, and safety factors caused the creation of a functional mooring mast on the Empire State Building to fail."
1736	16569	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the winds on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating unpredictable and hazardous conditions. Even though the dirigible were tied down to the mast, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. This would make it unsafe for pedestrians on the streets below. Another issue with landing the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk of fire. When a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that a similar accident would be much worse in downtown New York, with potential for catastrophic loss of life and property. These fundamental dangers ultimately proved insurmountable for the building's intended use as an airship terminal.
1737	16570	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put immense pressure on Al Smith and the builders to complete such a miraculous, tall building in a very short timeframe. A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over one million dollars worth of changes had to be made to the framework to reinforce it against these potential forces. The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for dirigibles to land there. The dirigibles were highly flammable, winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibiting the aircraft from flying so low over the city. Consequently, the ambitious vision for a skyscraper airship port was never realized in practice."
1738	16571	6	3	The builders of the Empire State faced a lot of obstacles while trying to build it. Some of these obstacles was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable would add immense stress to the base of the frame, threatening its structural integrity. Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around uncontrollably, making a stable connection nearly impossible. There was always the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium was, as those gases were extremely flammable and could lead to a disastrous fire. Those are some of the significant obstacles the builder face while trying to make the Empire State Building taller and more innovative than any other structure of its time.
1739	16572	6	3	The Empire State building had to face dangerous conditions every day like high-altitude winds, heavy lifting of materials, and the inherent risks of working at high heights. Workers were exposed to powerful gusts that could easily throw them off balance, while moving massive steel beams and other components required precise and perilous coordination. The sheer elevation at which they worked meant that a simple misstep could have fatal consequences. These daily hazards were a constant challenge that the builders had to manage carefully throughout the entire construction process to ensure the project's completion.
1740	16573	6	3	"After reading ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because it's a highly populated area, and such an incident would be devastating. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" With the building being so high, ""winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making a stable mooring operation extremely difficult. The conclusion has been made that dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building due to the height and wind. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there safely and practically."
1741	16574	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary problem was the critical issue of safety. Most dirigibles at the time were using highly flammable gases such as hydrogen, which posed a severe risk. This could be a detrimental problem if the dirigible ever caught fire above New York's public, leading to a catastrophic disaster. Another considerable problem was working with the forces of nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the skyscraper, causing the back ends of the airships to swivel unpredictably around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a significant safety hazard for the streets below. The last major problem builders faced was the existing law. At the time, there was a specific law against airships flying too low over cities, which made the entire concept legally dubious. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would therefore be considered illegal, ultimately dooming the ambitious plan.
1742	16575	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had ambitiously planned for it to be the tallest building in existence, but they were initially thwarted by the clever engineer of the Chrysler Building, who secretly constructed a spire. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men and reclaim the title, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring mast at the 102nd floor that would theoretically accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles, which proved challenging. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building to support this vision. They also needed to find safe ways to dock the blimps, but were unable to find practical methods, such as ways to extend an electric winch. Furthermore, the balloons were powered by flammable gases too, representing a clear safety hazard in a big city like New York. Plus, heavy weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to weigh down the ship, creating another insurmountable risk. These compounded problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite a lot, so the mooring mast was never used to its full potential and became a historical footnote.
1743	16576	6	3	"In the passage, *The Mooring Mast* by T. M. I., the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are clearly outlined. These primary obstacles were safety, nature, and law. Safety was a major obstacle because the passengers on the dirigibles, as well as the public below, would be put in significant danger. This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past, leading to tragic loss of life. Nature was another obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is undesirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The powerful wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone involved. Finally, there was a pre-existing law against airships in urban areas that presented a legal obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This regulation made it functionally unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used for its intended purpose. The obstacles outlined in the passage *The Mooring Mast* by T. M. I., therefore, allowed the architects to avoid wasting substantial funds on something that ultimately wouldn't be profitable or practical."
1744	16577	6	3	In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders to overcome. Al Smith, who was the driving force behind the project, wanted to make the building the tallest in the world. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a specially designed mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching an impressive 1,250 feet high. There were significant obstacles in the way of attaining this ambitious goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was commonly used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable and volatile. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, which highlighted the immense danger. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area where millions lived and worked. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted at such a high altitude. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians, swivelling around because of the wind; this made it very unsafe and not even practical for routine operations. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas. These were some of the key obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in their unique venture.
1745	16578	6	3	In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was structural, questioning how they could put this much stress on the building's framework from a massive airship, as mentioned in the text. Another serious problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below the proposed dock. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg did; all the pedestrians below would be in grave danger. Also the buildings around it would be in harm's way too, vulnerable to falling debris or a fiery crash. As stated, the dock was never really meant for practical use but was more of an architectural stunt. I think they just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler building, using the mooring mast as a clever excuse to add height and claim the title of the world's tallest structure.
1746	16579	6	3	"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building, a force for which the structure was not originally designed. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone or cause significant damage. The building would also have to be substantially strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a major financial undertaking. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" (para @NUM1) Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dririgible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so, but for the time being, the risks were simply too great."
1747	16580	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the airship couldn't moor at the Empire State Building because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, creating an unstable and hazardous environment for a large, buoyant aircraft. Another obstacle but the builders faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for airships if they ever try to approach the area, effectively prohibiting the very operation the mooring mast was intended for and rendering the ambitious plan impractical from a legal standpoint."
1748	16581	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey, a tragic event that highlighted the risks. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections, making the process nearly impossible. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Overall, these obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast, ensuring it remained an unused architectural feature.
1749	16582	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope."" A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.... Would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress, a costly and complex structural modification.The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element, ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area, fearing a catastrophic fire.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it, leaving the massive airship vulnerable to the powerful gusts. The builders of the empire state building atempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles safety flaws, and the flaws of nature allow dirigibles to dock there which ultimately didn't work out, and the mast never served its intended purpose."
1750	16583	6	3	"Al Smith had incredible vision with his plans for the Empire State Building. However, his excitement about dirigibles being allowed to dock at the top of the building, blinded him to the obvious obstacles in the way. Dirigibles themselves, were not safe modes of transportation. Hydrogen is very flammable, and would not be safe near large crowds of people, like in an urban area like New York, where a single spark could lead to disaster. From a practical viewpoint the mooring mast would not work either, because of the high elevation. The height of the building would have violent winds @CAPS1 it difficult for dirigibles to land for passengers to disembark safely and efficiently. The final major problem was that there was a law stating that  airships were not to fly too low over urban areas, creating a legal barrier that could not be ignored. Irvan Clavan summed it up when he said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" However, technology soon made dirigibles outdated, and the dream of a skyscraper airship terminal faded into history."
1751	16584	6	3	"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was safety. For one reason dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is @NUM1 ft tall, placing its mast in a zone of unpredictable weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials, causing a catastrophic deflation. Also on the tethering to the mooring mast, would... ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" the idea was dangerous. To hold the dirigible to the building there would be lead weights, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast was the problems that the builders faced, ultimately rendering the ambitious concept unworkable."
1752	16585	6	3	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock, demonstrating the fundamental challenge posed by the weather. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die, highlighting the immense risk of a city-center docking. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock, creating a final, legal barrier to the plan's feasibility."
1753	16586	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building, which collectively proved insurmountable."
1754	16587	6	3	"The ability to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, while initially lucrative, had major obstacles. The problems facing the development of the mooring mast would be cost, flammability of dirigibles, and weather over @NUM1 feet in the air. The structural and cost problems facing Al Smith was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" In order to overcome this obstacle, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and... over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made."" This is problematic because Al Smith now must spend more time and money than originally planned. Furthermore, another problem is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion ""above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York"", would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people in harms way. Finally the weather at the top of the Empire State building is unsuitable for docking dirigibles: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This is dangerous to the structure of the building, surrounding buildings, and people close by. Due to these problems, Al Smith and the engineers could not complete the Mooring Mast as a functional docking port."
1755	16588	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making a stable connection nearly impossible. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether, sealing the fate of the mast as a monumental spire rather than a functional airport."
1756	16589	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different challenges while trying to build a dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to make sure it was safe for passengers to walk on the platform to get off the blimps, which required a stable and secure structure. Also the dock had to be high so the owner could still keep the world's highest building record, necessitating its placement at the very summit. But with a little hat added wasn't going to do much so building a substantial dock was a better idea, though it introduced significant engineering difficulties. Ultimately, the ambitious plan proved to be more complex than initially anticipated.
1757	16590	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered both man-made problems and problems from nature while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was the building's structural strength. The building's steel framework was not nearly strong enough to ""transmit pressure from the dirigible's load to the building's foundation,"" requiring significant reinforcement. Also ""the winds at the top of the building were always moving and full of violent air currents,"" which would violently shove the Zeppelin into the edges of the building, creating a major safety hazard. It was prohibited for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and so making it illegal for a ship to even attempt to dock to the building. Price was also a critical factor, along with the building's enormous cost an additional sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework just to make the building strong enough to accommodate an airship. Through all of those severe problems the builders encountered, it is no wonder dirigibles docking at the mooring mast was not a feasible possibility."
1758	16591	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were several obstacles the builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Building a structure over a thousand feet tall was hard, and adding a mast for airships would be even harder and more complex. Allowing a dirigible to land and dock on the Empire State building would be inherently dangerous, as demonstrated by a real-world incident. The German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed, causing a massive amount of damage and loss of life. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been If It had taken Place above a densely Populated area Such as down town,"" highlighting the catastrophic risk. Therefore the mast was put up but never was used as a dirigible dock, serving only as a testament to an unrealized vision."
1759	16592	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The task of building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and dangerous job that pushed the limits of contemporary engineering. There were many obstacles the builders faced from the very beginning. One significant obstacle was the powerful and unpredictable winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" creating a hazardous work environment. This would make building very difficult because tools and materials would get blown around, endangering the workers. Another major obstacle was the structural requirement that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" a costly and time-consuming process. That means the builders first had to make the entire building strong enough to hold the heavy docking place before they could even start building the docking place itself. These two primary obstacles that the builders faced made constructing the docking place much harder and delayed its completion. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger with additional steel reinforcements. Also they had to constantly watch the wind conditions so that they would not get hurt while working at such a great height."
1760	16593	6	3	The obstacles that the builders had with docking the Dirigibles were numerous and complex. One issue was that even though the airships would be tied up at the front, the back end would still swivel freely in the wind, making it impossible to secure the entire vessel safely. They couldn't put little weights on the back because if they ever fell they would strike pedestrians on the streets far below, creating an unacceptable public danger. And there was a law passed that prohibited airships from docking on buildings or even coming close to urban areas, rendering the entire concept legally problematic. That is some of the significant obstacles the workers faced in their ambitious but ultimately impractical endeavor.
1761	16594	6	3	Technology was not caught up to the ambitions of dirigible travel. They could not dock because neither the building nor the dirigible had the right equipment, and that was one of the primary obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The necessary technology for a secure and safe docking procedure simply did not exist at the time. For instance, when they had to deliver the newspaper by air, the lack of specialized machinery made the entire operation perilous and impractical. This fundamental technological gap ensured that the visionary concept of a skyscraper air terminal remained an unattainable dream.
1762	16595	6	3	"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the need to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthened, all that stress and force would risk collapsing the structure. Another obstacle faced in the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying its safety protocols. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, it would guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, so a destroyed dirigible would put in danger both the passengers aboard and the pedestrians below. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature itself presented another significant obstacle. Strong winds can affect the building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is nowhere close to safe. Furthermore, the law enforced that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in a state of danger, as the dirigible could be blown by the wind onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These were the formidable obstacles faced in any attempt to dock a dirigible successfully."
1763	16596	6	3	The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the multitude of problems that could have arisen from their ambitious plan. Balloons are not very strong, and if they didn't already know, it is incredibly windy on the top of the Empire State Building. The powerful wind could drive the dirigible directly into its spiky doom upon the building's mast. They had no real way of keeping the dirigible securely contained because usually, heavy lead blocks held it down on the ground. From 102 stories in the air, however, that was not the safest or most feasible plan. Also, most non-American dirigibles used hydrogen instead of the safer helium. In a crowded metropolis like New York City, a fireball resulting from a hydrogen ignition would be utterly devastating due to the gas being highly flammable. The builders really should have planned this entire venture out much better from the very beginning.
1764	16597	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to face when constructing the mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. Top winds, the flammability of the foreign ships, and existing airspace laws all hindered the production and ultimate use of the blimp dock. Very high up in New York, the winds are particularly dangerous and unpredictable. If a blimp tried to dock there, its back end would be whipped around by gusts and could end up harming people or property below. Being that high up, such an event is profoundly dangerous. Many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, as tragically witnessed with the Hindenburg disaster. When that event occurred, the owners of the building thought it was too risky having those volatile things flying over highly populated areas. Furthermore, there were laws made prohibiting low-flying aircraft over densely populated urban areas, so there could be no docking without breaking the law every single time. That was not a risk the owners were willing to take. Ultimately, the idea of the mooring mast was a very under-thought idea. The builders forgot that the wind, the flammability of the ships, and the airspace laws would all combine to stop the mast's success. Now the iconic building just has a long, useless pole on top of it.
1765	16598	6	3	"The immense weight was a critical obstacle they faced. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified & strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The weight of the dirigible would simply be too heavy for the existing frame because the frame was not originally designed to bear that much additional load. Furthermore, some dirigibles were highly flammable. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that it was too dangerous a proposition because the building was located in a densely populated urban area. The air pressure and wind were another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell...."" The final obstacle was the law itself. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This regulation ultimately would not allow any dirigible to land at the Empire State Building due to its specific location in the heart of the city."
1766	16599	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary challenge was structural. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" That was struggle number one, as a thousand-foot dirigible would add too much stress to the frame. The immense forces involved presented a significant engineering problem. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and as the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" That was another obstacle the builder's had to overcome considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below. This required a comprehensive reinforcement of the entire structure. Consequently, the Empire State building then had to be strengthened and modified in order to build a stronger foundation for the mooring of a dirigible upon the Empire State Building, a process that was both complex and costly. Those were some of the many obstacles the builder's went through in designing the mast, highlighting the ambitious nature of the project."
1767	16600	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obstacles that the builders faced. Some of the obstacles that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the the buildings flat roof because it would stress the frame to much. The immense weight and the dynamic forces of a moored airship required significant structural adjustments. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the buildings frame work to reinforce it against these new loads. Another obstacle was that the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose due to a combination of practical and safety concerns that ultimately prevented its use."
1768	16601	6	3	"The architects building the Empire State Building encountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. The second sentence in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Although the architects faced many problems this was the biggest, as it threatened the integrity of the entire structure. This meant that they would have to change the buildings structure in order to make it work, necessitating a major redesign. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the steel framework to properly distribute the immense stresses involved."
1769	16602	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building face a good amount of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock upon it's mast. The wind proved to be a very big problem for the blimps. Not only would they swing about dangerously when tethered to the mast, that on the few occasions that a dirigible actually approached the Empire state building, they couldn't maneuver close enough due to the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another thing that stood in the way of the Empire State Building's dock being used was the danger it presented to the buildings and people below. The gas, hydrogen, that dirigibles used to float is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire,... the owners... realized how much worse the accident would have been... above a densely populated area."" The third and final obstacle they faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With all that potential danger and discouragement, it's no wonder the Empire State building was never used for docking dirigibles, rendering the ambitious mast a historical curiosity."
1770	16603	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. Because it was held by a Single Cable tether that would add Stress to the buildings frame, posing a serious structural challenge. Another obstacle was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the Building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, requiring the entire structure to channel these forces downward. Even though, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new Situation, involving extensive engineering work. Overall, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications, a significant investment for a feature that would ultimately see no practical use.
1771	16604	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in establishing a functional dirigible docking station. One of the main legal hurdles was a law that banned the use of low-flying aircraft in densely populated urban areas like New York City. Another significant reason for the impracticality was the inherent lack of safety in docking these massive blimps at such a great height. Almost one thousand feet up, the winds would have been very violent and unpredictable. With the tail end of the dirigible not being fastened down, it was very likely that the airship could get spun around by gusts and end up tangled with the mast. The danger was compounded by the fact that many foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen, which was highly flammable; an accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster involving fire occurring over an urban place like New York City could have been profoundly tragic. Lastly, in order to even build the mast, the builders had to reinforce the structural frame of the building so that it could bear the immense stress that such a station would put on the entire structure, a costly and complex engineering challenge in itself.
1772	16605	6	3	"In the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, builders were faced with several different and formidable obstacles. One primary obstacle was determining how they were going to modify the building to be able to support a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" because the sheer weight and force would add too much stress to the building's existing frame. Another significant obstacle, along with the necessary structural modifications, was the considerable financial cost. Building this new structure would require, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications,"" a substantial investment for an unproven concept. One of the most important obstacles, however, was public and operational safety. Although most blimps in the United States used inert helium, outside countries mainly used hydrogen. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, was absolutely out of the question for use in a city as highly and densely populated as New York. The other safety hazards included the powerful winds which were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" at that altitude, a problem exacerbated because the back of the blimp could not be weighed down securely. Furthermore, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would make their attempts not only dangerous but also illegal. In the end, due to this combination of financial, structural, and safety concerns, the mooring mast was never completed or used for its intended purpose."
1773	16606	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few critical obstacles in their plan for a dirigible dock. One of those obstacles was ensuring that the blimps and other air-borne transportation methods did not interfere with the building's structure or the urban airspace. Also, another significant obstacle the builders had to deal with was making absolutely certain the docking areas were safe for the city below. Because if a blimp got too close to an urban city like New York and had all those flammable fuels leak out, perhaps due to a collision or an accident, it would be a big disaster, endangering countless lives. These fundamental concerns regarding interference and catastrophic safety failures were the primary obstacles the builders faced and ultimately could not overcome."
1774	16607	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by the organization, many inherent problems with the dirigible mast of the Empire State Building are explained. One of the many structural problems was that the large dirigible tied to the building's mast would add tremendous stress to the building, which could potentially cause the structure to collapse or be severely damaged. But this particular problem was eventually addressed by the engineers strengthening the building's foundation and frame. A second, more grave problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building was the presence of highly flammable gases like hydrogen that the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire, its burning metal frame could fall to the ground, endangering citizens below in the crowded streets. The last operational danger would be that while the dirigible was docked, strong air currents coming off of the building itself could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around wildly on the mast. One proposed way to fix this instability would be to place lead weights on the back of the ship. But this solution introduced a new peril, as if one of these heavy weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm or kill pedestrians below. Because of these interconnected and unsolvable problems, the mast could never be safely used for its intended purpose."
1775	16608	6	3	When designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles that the architects and the engineers were faced with. One primary problem was they could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building because it was too heavy for the existing frame of the building to support. So because of that fundamental problem, the architects and engineers had to come up with a way to modify and reinforce the frame of the building so that the structure could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast and a tethered airship. Another critical problem that they were faced with was that the entire operation was deemed too dangerous. It was deemed dangerous because most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which was extremely flammable, and they could not risk having a tragedy similar to what happened to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors above city streets that were crowded with people. So those were a few of the significant obstacles that the designers were faced with when planning the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, challenges that ultimately prevented the concept from becoming a practical reality.
1776	16609	6	3	The @CAPS1 says the greatest obstacle would be nature itself. The wind would blow the blimps on to the sharp spires of other buildings, creating a significant hazard for both the airship and the city structures below. This constant and unpredictable wind made any attempt at docking a perilous endeavor. The natural elements thus presented an insurmountable challenge to the plan.
1777	16610	6	3	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible docked there, the violent air currents would have shifted it constantly, making a secure connection nearly impossible. The use of lead weights to stabilize the craft would put pedestrians at risk on the streets far below. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas, which directly prohibited the intended operation. Because of these compelling reasons, it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe and ultimately unfeasible.
1778	16611	6	3	After finishing the @ORGANIZATION1, architects wanted to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems the architect had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was that most @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and after the Hindenburg @CAPS2 up in @ORGANIZATION2, architects feared a similar catastrophe could happen in @CAPS3, but many more would die. Another problem was high winds. Because it was so windy at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady for a safe docking procedure. Also, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building because there was nothing holding down the front and back, leading to a complete loss of control. The third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the Empire State Building. That's why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the Empire State Building, and the mast remained unused.
1779	16612	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First off, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows an obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @MONEY1 of funds would be needed. The funds would be required for the strengthening and modification of the steel frame, thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the entire operation. Second, the greatest concern was safety. This is brought to hand because most dirigibles are very flammable. They consisted of hydrogen, which is an extremely flammable gas, posing a constant danger. Also, if the dirigible were to mount to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would be swaying around and around. This possibly would have a chance of dis-mounting and it crashing into a densely populated area of people. These are some of the primary reasons that illustrate the obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of the empire state building."
1780	16613	6	3	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle that the builders could not overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e. planes or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project was shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles to make the venture successful."
1781	16614	6	3	"To design a mast for the dirigibles to land was no easy matter; architects could not just plop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof without considering the immense structural implications. The stress from a thousand foot dirigible would transmit weight and wind pressure all the way to the foundation, posing a significant engineering challenge. To be able to create this mast, the Empire State building would have to be extensively modified and strengthend throughout its core structure. First, the architects ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a steeped-back design that imitated the overall shapp of the building itself."" This rocket shapped mast would have four wings at its corners constructed of lightweight yet strong aluminum and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm, the crucial component for securing the airship. For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery room to allow for operational access. Finnally, when this was all completed the existing plans for the building were to be put in place, integrating the new mast into the iconic skyscraper's final form."
1782	16615	6	3	"There were many obstacles which the builders of the mooring mast had to face, which proved more complex than initially anticipated. They thought it was going to be an easy task to accomplish as shown in paragraph eight where Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and he responded ""[It's] on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" This shows how truly sure Smith was about the goal's simplicity and the straightforward nature of the project in its early stages. Although determination was a great factor in the building of this world wide known monument, problems kept standing in the way of success, creating significant delays. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the author describes how the Empire State building would not be able to fulfill it's purpose, even though workers should've known better from the outset. She states ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 kept pooring down, one of them being nature, with its unpredictable and powerful wind currents at such a high altitude. Finally the workers gave up after the project was postpone due to mainly safety reasons, acknowledging the inherent risks involved. By the late 1930's, the idea of the mooring mast had almost disappeared from public discourse and practical consideration. All that really matters is that they tried, and all it took was just one dream to envision such an ambitious feat of engineering."
1783	16616	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few significant problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, each presenting a unique challenge. one of the first and most critical problems they faced was safety, a primary concern for any public structure. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, @NUM1). The builders would have to keep this in mind throughout the design process to mitigate potential disaster. The next obstacle they faced was nature and its powerful and unpredictable winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents,"" (@NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable and could easily destabilize a massive airship during docking maneuvers. Lastly, the builders had to worry about the law pertaining to airships flying too low over urban areas, which presented a legal barrier. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" (@NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the considerable difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building's summit."
1784	16617	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles such as safety, nature, and law in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, each presenting a formidable barrier to the project's success. The issue of safety became particularly apparent because most dirigibles made outside of the @LOCATION1 were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than the safer alternative of helium. To risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating, with potential for massive loss of life and property. Nature too became a major problem in the futile attempt of the builders, introducing an element of uncontrollable chaos. With such ""Violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM1), the dirigible would swivel around dangerously even if it were tied up to the mooring mast, making a secure connection nearly impossible. Finally, law was a definitive obstacle to the builders, creating an insurmountable legal hurdle. Existing legislation banned airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM2), meaning the dirigibles would have no legal way of landing atop the urban building. Ultimately, obstacles such as safety, nature, and law hindered the ambitious attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building, sealing the fate of the venture."
1785	16618	6	3	In the @CAPS1, the docking of dirigibles had many issues that made the concept impractical from the start. One primary concern was that boarding passengers would be very difficult and dangerous, as the dirigible will @CAPS2 violently from a sudden gust of wind, making any gangway connection unstable. Second, the gases used to make the craft afloat are highly flammable, and explode quite easily, posing a constant and grave risk to the vessel and anyone near it. These fundamental problems of passenger safety and volatile lifting gas ultimately made the entire proposition too hazardous to implement on a consistent and reliable basis.
1786	16619	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to have dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a huge safety issue; ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flamible"" (paragraph @NUM1). If an accident happened, to the magnitude of the Hindenburg disaster, over New York City, thousands of people could die because of this highly flamible substance. Secondly, a very large problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building work constantly shifting due to air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the wind was out of controll and the dirigible wasn't tied down right, the harsh winds could cause the airship to be dangerously dangeling over the people of New York. Amongst many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have ever been thought of as a realistic or safe endeavor."
1787	16620	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted you learn about the plans for the Empire State Building but, you also learn why the Mooring Mast cannot be used for it's original purpose. The Mooring Mast was planned to be used as a docking station for dirigibles, or blimps. One reason why the Mooring Mast could not dock these is because places outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The excerpt states ""Most dirigibles outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable."" (∂ @NUM1) @CAPS1 they did not want to risk a huge fire in a highly populated area. Another reason why it would not work was violent air currents. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be wirled around the mooring mast."" (∂ @NUM2) @CAPS1 with that problem they would have to worry about the mast being taken out or the airship being damaged. The last reason is because of a law. The excerpt states ""an existing law against airships flying too lower over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM3) The building mast was to close to humans to let them dock there safely. @CAPS1 while the mast was a brilliant idea it could not be done and now it is only a dream from a past era."
1788	16621	6	3	The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely hard for a captain to control their ship. When anchored to the mast by a single tether, the dirigible would be twisted around the spire by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers or cargo safely. Another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in the heart of New York City. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these significant obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never accomplished their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast as a routine practice.
1789	16622	6	3	"An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 was weight. In the story it says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly @NUM1 feet below."" This immense force posed a serious structural challenge. Another obstacle was nature. The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This unpredictable weather made safe and stable docking an impossibility."
1790	16623	6	3	"The architects had to go through many obstacles such as having to rebuild the whole frame of the Empire State building. In paragraph nine it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" @CAPS1 they had to modify and strengthened the whole thing to accommodate the new situation and the additional loads. Another obstacle they had to face, was that hydrogen was highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that an accident like that could be far worse in the crowded streets of New York. Another obstacle was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around, but could be held down with lead weights, but like paragraph @NUM1 says ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling, is neither practical nor safe."" These combined factors ultimately prevented the mast from being used as intended."
1791	16624	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, it would have been almost impossible to dock with the violent winds blowing at that height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". It would not have been feasible to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law prohibiting airships from flying too low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" That's saying that even if a dirigible could moor at the Empire State Building, it's illegal because all airships have to fly a certain height over urban areas. The workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were just too great to overcome. Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will."
1792	16625	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation due to the immense pulling force. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted by city regulations. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable and posed a significant fire hazard over a densely populated city. After all the hard work to be successful, Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York, ultimately deciding the risks were too high.
1793	16626	6	3	"Dirigibles are large steel-frame balloons enclosed by cotton and filled with hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930's, the new idea came about that the dirigibles would dock at the top of the Empire State Building in New York. After reading The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, we have learned of the obstacles the builders were faced with. The author notes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The dirigibles would constantly be moving and shifting, making a safe and stable docking procedure nearly impossible to achieve. The author also states, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law was set in place for public safety reasons. Due to the two main obstacles; nature and law, builders weren't able to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, rendering the ambitious plan impractical."
1794	16627	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building had numerous obstacles in their way if they planned on allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first and most serious problem was the safety of the passengers as well as pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. In 1937 in New Jersey the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire, a tragic event that highlighted the inherent dangers. This catastrophe would have been worse if it were to take place over the heads of people in New York city. Nature also posed a huge threat to the completion of the docking mast. Due to the air currents on the top of the building the blimp (dirigible) would constantly be shifting. The only way to control the swaying of the blimp would be to use weights to hold the blimp down, which would again put the public at risk if they were to fall. Along with natural hazards it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the Empire State building because of an existing law. The idea to allow dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical and was wisely abandoned.
1795	16628	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there like nature, law, and the danger of the sharp spire. Nature was probably the biggest problem because you can't control wind. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building were so strong cause ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."" This would make it hard to land and unload the dirigibles safely. Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which directly forbade the proposed docking procedure. The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it, presenting a physical hazard. If a dirigible was to hit it, it would pop the dirigible and kill many people below from falling debris or fire. These combined factors made the entire concept unworkable."
1796	16629	6	3	"The one obstacle the builders had when trying to build this building was not a way for the dirigibles' landing to be convenient for all. The dirigibles had a very fast speed of eight miles per hour, and they were as big as four blocks of New York City, paragraph @NUM1. This was a problem for the builders because the dirigibles were very big, and the building itself was as well. The size was a problem because the enormous dirigibles would not be landing in the right space, requiring a precise and clear approach path that the urban environment could not provide. Having a lack of time was always a problem because the building would not be completed on time. The builders always had to hold back because ""engineers consulted with experts... architects met with presidents"" paragraph @NUM2. Holding back on the making of the building to meet with those people took away valuable time from the construction schedule. When there is something very high, and wide in the way there will be a problem, and these combined issues of scale and bureaucracy ultimately proved difficult to overcome."
1797	16630	6	3	Some of the problems with constructing docking facilities for dirigibles were that natural causes like high winds, as stated in ∂ 6, presented a significant danger. The dirigibles were highly flammable due to the use of hydrogen gases that made the dirigibles fly, creating a constant risk of fire or explosion. Also another important factor was that this project was being taken place in a highly populated area, which meant harm could be done to civilians if anything ever went wrong. A single accident during a docking maneuver could have resulted in catastrophic loss of life and property damage on the crowded city streets below. These inherent risks made the entire proposal exceptionally dangerous from the outset.
1798	16631	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they had was the violent winds blowing the blimp around at a high altitude, with people onboard, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"" making a stable and secure connection nearly impossible. Another setback was it being illegal to fly an aircraft that low, as it was ""illegal for a ship to tie up to a building,"" creating an immediate regulatory barrier. Also it was dangerous for dirigibles that ran on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a severe fire hazard in the heart of the city. Consequently, the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building became nothing more than an attraction for sightseers, a testament to an ambitious but impractical vision."
1799	16632	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included that they could not moor at the Empire State Building due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area safely, presenting a fundamental legal challenge that the project's planners could not circumvent. The regulation was designed for public safety but directly contradicted the building's intended function as a dirigible terminal. Although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped, these efforts were more for show than practical use, and the legal prohibition remained a definitive obstacle.
1800	16633	6	3	"They had to go through a lot in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, ""one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area,"" and also another ""obstacle I would have to say is nature""! They wanted to dock the dirigibles at the Empire State Building. I say wanted because their plan did not work; too many things were wrong. Like the fact that they said ""one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing""—they couldn't find a good landing area for the dirigibles without something bad happening, such as a collision. Another ""obstacle they had was nature""; I say nature because if the wind blew, it could blow away the airship and endanger people. So those are the main obstacles that they had to go through @CAPS1 to allow the dirigibles to dock there, and in the end, these challenges proved too great to overcome."
