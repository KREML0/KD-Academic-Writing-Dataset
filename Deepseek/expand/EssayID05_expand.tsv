1	11827	5	3	In this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez's life, the overarching mood was one of profound gratitude, and it showed how his parents gave him unwavering love throughout his whole life. Both his parents were born and raised in Cuba, and in 1956, they both made the courageous decision to move to the United States. They began starting their lives over again, diligently taking any job they could find to build a new foundation. Then in 1961, their son, Narciso Rodriguez, was born. Both parents raised him with immense love, and careful attention, consciously introducing his rich Cuban background into his daily life. As Narciso Rodriguez was telling his story, all readers could easily tell how genuinely grateful he was to have a supportive and nurturing family like he did. Also, as he shared memories of his non-blood-related family, and the remembrance of how his parents' entire lives were transformed by moving to the United States, he consistently showed the deep respect and admiration he held towards them for their immense sacrifice and enduring love.
2	11828	5	3	"Throughout the excerpt from *Home the Blueprints of Our Lives*, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, skillfully manages to maintain a single, consistent overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood, so it initially led me to think the mood was nostalgia, but nowhere does the text emphasize that he yearns to return to those past times. He always declared how genuinely loving and selfless his family was, how they consistently aided others in their community, and how he ultimately became ""family"" with his close-knit neighbors. Due to this overwhelming evidence, I have found the tone to be deeply loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states with clear emotion how his parents were so brave to leave their entire lives in Cuba behind, a monumental sacrifice made just so he could have a better future. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times, with palpable pride, on how his parents helped so many people in need. If placed in Rodriguez's position, I would undoubtedly love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their countless selfless deeds and their devoted upbringing of their son, a sentiment that clearly resonates throughout his writing."
3	11829	5	3	"The predominant mood the author created in the memoir is one of love and deep appreciation. Throughout the narrative, the author finds out and emphasizes that family doesn't have to be solely blood related, a significant realization. In the author's vibrant neighborhood, it is noted that ""despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" (@NUM1), creating a unique community. The author clearly loves their parents because they came, ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM2), a central theme of their sacrifice. The author is very grateful that her parents, ""Mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (@NUM3), facing immense challenges head-on. Ultimately, the author's parents gave him a great life by moving to the United States and, through hard work and love, ""turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM4), a testament to their enduring spirit and dedication."
4	11830	5	3	The mood created by the author is focused on showing how Cuban immigrants lived and about their cherished culture, and how they maintained their traditions in a new land. It highlights how some people from other cultures could be different and don't always seem to have cared about their own cultural roots, while some people, like Narciso's parents, do care deeply about their culture. That is precisely what the author is trying to convey through this personal account. The underlying message is that some people should respect their own culture and heritage and not feel pressured to abandon it in an attempt to be part of a different culture, advocating for pride in one's identity and origins.
5	11831	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is one of heartfelt happiness and profound gratitude. Narciso is deeply grateful to his parents for moving to the United States, and for still managing to give him the warm, happy feeling of a home, reminiscent of one in Cuba. His parents lovingly passed down their vibrant culture to him, and he is truly happy that they did, enriching his life. Narciso is glad to have lived in the specific home that they did, and for all the opportunities that he had as a child growing up in that environment. He is particularly grateful that his extended family always got together and had festive feasts filled with traditional Cuban music, joyful activities, and authentic food. His parents gave up their previous careers and had to start their lives over entirely, a sacrifice he acknowledges. Narciso is also grateful that he learned the real, expansive definition of ""family"" from his upbringing. He is also very grateful to his parents for their unconditional love and immense personal sacrifice, which formed the foundation of his successful and culturally rich life."
6	11832	5	3	"The mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better. The mood is a complex mixture of both happy and sad feelings because of the poignant way the author states his ideas. For example, the sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" makes me feel a sense of sweet sorrow because he has grown up and everything is now just a memory, yet he tenderly keeps those happy memories alive. Most of the other ideas, like ""I will be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" also carry the same bittersweet reasons for being both happy and sad. However, statements like ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" makes me feel happy and inspired that his parents were so determined and brave. Overall the main idea is remembering the good and bad times of his life, and the mood for this idea is a reflective blend of happy and sad."
7	11833	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" he incorporated a profound sense of love and passion into the overall mood. You can tell this by how fondly and strongly Narciso talks about the people and places from his past. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm houses."" In this one sentence alone, you could feel Narciso's deep passion and abiding love for this home of theirs. Narciso puts a great deal of love and heartfelt thankfulness into his writing when talking about his parents. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'... I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" These two sentences are most likely the strongest in Narciso's memoir; these two are also the ones filled with the most passion and emotional meaning. As you can see, in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the mood he creates is one of enduring love and passion."
8	11834	5	3	"In the excerpt the mood created by the author is a pervasive sense of love. This is a love for family and a love for each other that transcends simple definitions. The author talks about his parents in a deeply loving and respectful way, stating, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author describes all his parents went through, their struggles and sacrifices, to make their own and his life better. In doing so they turned a simple apartment into a true place of love and caring that he will never forget and, more importantly, passed this fundamental love onto him. The author also talks about his extended ""family"" and the love shared between them, noting, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" The author's ""family"" wasn't completely blood related. Many people were friends, but they were very close friends that had become like family and were always welcomed with open arms. Finally, the author talks about his community, observing, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" No matter what nationality they were, the community was very close together and understanding. It was these basic principles of friendship, trust, love, and caring that were passed onto the author of this excerpt by a variety of people, and these elements collectively give the excerpt its powerful mood of love."
9	11835	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of feeling grateful and fortunate. Narciso Rodriguez talks about being so fortunate to have his wonderful parents and his rich heritage of being Cuban. From the text, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is saying that he was so happy and lucky to have his parents, which establishes the main mood of the memoir as gratitude. Another mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is happiness. He makes the story happy by saying how great and joyful it was to grow up with his loving family. He also says that his family included a lot of people in his neighborhood as well, expanding his circle of happiness. He is truly happy to have had such a great family. From another part of the text, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" These elements of gratitude and happiness are the two primary moods created by Rodriguez in his memoir."
10	11836	5	3	"The author generally stayed in one consistent mood throughout the piece. The mood portrayed in the story was that family and friends are very important and that they help shape what you will be in the future. This is why the author stressed how thankful he was that his family had come to this country to make him a better life and that his friends came over to share their diverse cultures. Also the author was saying that even in a new place, it was important to remember his Cuban blood and culture. This is why he says ""...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sensory details reinforce his deep cultural connection. Also the author says that a home is where great memories are made and where you grow up, and you should never forget it, cementing the theme of cherished origins."
11	11837	5	3	The mood that the author creates in this story is a sad mood. But it is also one of hope and transition, as the guy in it is getting a new home and a new life. His parents are making this significant change for the family, which introduces a complex mix of emotions. The sadness of leaving the familiar behind is palpable, yet it is intertwined with the anticipation for a fresh start. This emotional duality defines the narrative's atmosphere, showing that even in moments of loss, there can be a foundation for future happiness. The story ultimately portrays this period as a difficult but necessary step forward.
12	11838	5	3	The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tells you about his parents; the selflessness and the way they put their kids first before themselves really just makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with. The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. This entire sensory experience, filled with familial love and vibrant imagery, is what makes the mood so comforting. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in, as it evokes a deep sense of peace and belonging.
13	11839	5	3	The mood of the memoir is very upbeat, happy mood of how Narciso grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a very Cuban family and tells the story of how Narciso went through his childhood. This memoir really emphasizes the connection and love that Narciso had with his parents and his home. The narrative is filled with lively anecdotes and fond recollections that highlight the joy found in everyday family life. It kind of makes you think that there is more to a house than just walls and a ceiling and that maybe it's part of a family. The author successfully conveys that a home is built from memories and the love shared within it, creating an overall feeling of warmth and celebration.
14	11840	5	3	Describe the mood by the author in the memoir. The mood by the author in the memoir is that she had a hard time growing up because her parents keep on moving. By the age of twenty-seven years old, Narciso Rodriguez was living with her family in a one apartment room. When she was growing up there were racism where she was growing up. These challenges created an underlying tone of hardship and struggle throughout her youth. When she was growing up her mother and father taught her how to cook, and the number one thing she learned is how to love someone. Despite the difficulties, this foundation of familial love and practical wisdom provided a resilient and hopeful spirit that permeates her recollections, showing how strength was forged in a demanding environment.
15	11841	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. The presence of a supportive community provided a constant source of comfort and joy. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. These milestones are recounted with a sense of delight and cherished memory. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This consistent security and absence of want reinforces the positive outlook. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living, a testament to a life filled with simple yet profound blessings.
16	11842	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or until they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family, extending a sense of security and community. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every opportunity he gets in life, reflecting a deep-seated appreciation for his journey. The mood also shows how that something small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in, proving that profound impact is not limited by physical scale. This overall feeling of gratitude and interconnectedness defines the memoir's emotional core, leaving a lasting impression of warmth and human kindness. Ultimately, the narrative celebrates how simple acts of love can build a life of great significance and fulfillment.
17	11843	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a mood. The mood is love. The author loves his parents for all the things they sacrificed to come to a new land, expressing profound respect for their courage and resilience. He really appreciates everything they've done for him and he is really grateful, a sentiment that permeates every recollection. The author describes the ""warmth"" of his kitchen, a central hub of his childhood memories. How it's filled with love and culture, with the great aroma of their parents cooking and the music from his culture, he loves it, these sensory details vividly bringing the scene to life. The author also describes how his family is exceptionally close, and their friends too, bound by a powerful sense of loyalty. The love that they got for each other is unmistakable. The memoir says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This demonstrates how they considered people who weren't really family to be part of their own. They helped each other out, family and friends, that's what creates the mood to be love. Thus, in this memoir, the author creates a mood and its LOVE, a powerful testament to the family we are born into and the family we choose."
18	11844	5	3	"The author of this memoir created a mood about family. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" this quote tells that the mood created by the author makes the reader realize how hard their parents work to give their children a better life and education, highlighting the immense weight of their sacrifice. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family',"" this also makes the reader feel like there is a lot more to a family then what it may seem on the surface. That family gives one life and teaches love, shaping one's character and values fundamentally. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" this quote tells that home is not just a place where one may live, but that it is about relationships that are created there, infused with shared experiences and mutual care. These were some of the moods created by the author in the memoir, collectively painting a portrait of family defined by sacrifice, unconditional love, and the creation of a nurturing home environment that transcends mere physical structure."
19	11845	5	3	"The mood created by this author is clearly grateful. The author shows how he (Narciso) could never stop saying thank you, his appreciation flowing through the narrative. He honestly loved the feeling his mom and dad made him have, and all the things they did for him, from small daily gestures to life-altering decisions. By what the parents did by moving into a place to call home for Narciso made his mood forever endlessly grateful, recognizing their efforts as the foundation of his well-being. By Narciso's mood being grateful I mean endlessly thankful for all that he has thanks to his parents, acknowledging every advantage and comfort as a gift from their labor. In this short autobiography, Narciso creates the reader to feel, and know he is happy with the life he has, sharing his contentment openly. As this short story creates the mood of being grateful, you understand how he feels as you read many times through out this article, ""I will always be grateful to my parents..."" This recurring declaration solidifies the central theme, concluding that a life viewed through a lens of gratitude is a life fully lived and cherished."
20	11846	5	3	The mood set by the author in the memoir is a home is home kind of mood, like a great family, great friendships/relationships and open arms kind of feeling, evoking a deep sense of belonging. He mentions the fact that his parents always helped friends and family in need and how selfless they were towards other people, setting a powerful example of community support. He talks about how him and his family used to come together and have meals as a family, moments that strengthened their bonds and created a repository of cherished memories. He says he is grateful for the spirit and generosity given to him by his parents at a young age, values that he clearly carries forward into his own life. He gives the reader a sense of comfort and generosity and he thanks his family deeply for expressing spirit, generosity and selflessness to people, ensuring their legacy continues. This heartfelt acknowledgment of his upbringing culminates in a profound appreciation for the intangible gifts of character and compassion, which ultimately define his concept of home.
21	11847	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, joyful, and loving. The mood is grateful because the author's parents were such wonderful people, which made the author look up to them. The author even says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" highlighting the deep appreciation felt for their guidance. The mood is also joyful because, although the author lived in just a simple house, inside, there was always music and he was positively influenced by his vibrant culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" creating an atmosphere of warmth and celebration. After all, a house is only a ""home"" if you feel welcome and love, and that is exactly how the author felt within those walls. Lastly, the mood is loving because in his home, his parents welcomed anyone who needed help, extending their kindness generously. An example from the memoir is, ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us,"" demonstrating a community built on mutual care. Overall, the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy, a resilient happiness that persisted even through difficult times like segregation."
22	11848	5	3	In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood despite facing challenges. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negative for him while growing up, but then he canceled those negative things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation, focusing on the new opportunities. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up, instilling a powerful value. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story have an upbeat and happy mood through his reflective perspective. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others, leaving the reader with an inspiring message.
23	11849	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented. From the very beginning, the author describes the home as more of a way of life than a physical space, emphasizing its emotional significance. The author's ""parents created our traditional Cuban home, part of which was the kitchen,"" a place that was the heart of their daily life. Here, the home is described even more as a part of the family, less as a mere building, which fosters a deep sense of belonging. To enhance the feeling of family, the author includes stories of hospitality and open-heartedness: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door to the many people he considered family."" Hospitality is one of the best qualities you need to make a house a home and the author really stretches that concept to show how love expanded beyond their immediate relatives. The mood created by the author of the memoir is therefore profoundly cozy and family oriented, centered on warmth and inclusivity."
24	11850	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the setting, which is depicted as vibrant and full of life. Narciso describes his house and says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back-drop to life in our warm home."" The author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories, creating a nostalgic and cheerful tone. Another reason is how grateful the author sounds for his parents' sacrifices. It says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" While they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life, and the author is profoundly happy that they did. Also, the author credits the house with giving him a true sense of belonging, stating, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of the word 'family.' And for this, I will be forever grateful."" He learned a lot in this house and is very happy for that, which completes the positive reflection. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir he creates a very happy mood through these cherished memories and lessons."
25	11851	5	3	Based on this memoir, the mood created by the author is a great and positive mood, though it feels almost unexplainable in its depth. In this article, the author talks about a young man and how his life was from then and now, reflecting on his past with fondness. For example, he says he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices, a sentiment that forms the core of the narrative's warmth. He reflects on how he had always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that he could have ever done, acknowledging their immense strength. Also, he describes how Cuban music was so passionate, adored so much, and how his parents turned a simple house into a real home through their love and culture. Therefore, this is the grateful and affectionate mood created by the author, one of deep appreciation for family and heritage.
26	11852	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez was happy and thankful, a feeling deeply rooted in his upbringing. His parents taught him many things about their Cuban background, like cooking traditional meals and the vibrant sounds of their music. His parents gave up many things to comfort Narciso and make him feel at home, creating a warm and secure environment. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" he reflected. His parents turned their house into a home for other people as well, extending their kindness beyond their immediate family. ""My parents always kept their arms and door open to the many people we considered family."" Narciso's parents would take in anybody that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet, offering shelter and support without hesitation. Narciso's parents were very loving to the community and helped out as much as they could in making that place a home, embodying a spirit of generosity that defined his childhood."
27	11853	5	3	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a serious, happy, and thankful mood. The author was serious in reflecting on the point where his family had to go through economic and personal problems, acknowledging the difficulties they faced. However, the author was happy with how they lived in a friendly and unified neighborhood with other immigrants from different countries, finding joy in their shared experiences. The author showed thankfulness because his parents worked so hard to give him a new life, sacrificing their own comfort for his future. The memoir showed a good mood as well as an accurate portrait of the author's childhood, capturing both the challenges and the warmth of his early years. This balanced perspective provides a heartfelt look into his formative experiences.
28	11854	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez's mood was happy and grateful. He was grateful primarily because he had his family together and his mom and dad were open house with the culture, sharing their rich heritage freely. He was happy because his life was better than it would have been if they had stayed in Cuba, appreciating the new opportunities available to him. His parents' efforts to create a nurturing and culturally vibrant home were central to his positive outlook. That was Narciso Rodriguez's mood, one defined by appreciation for his family's love and the improved circumstances they provided.
29	11855	5	3	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the mood and feeling of her home and community is a happy and heartwarming situation. Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was too small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells from home cooking, wonderful music filling the rooms, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the main people who contributed the most to her wonderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were struggling for money, yet they always provided a loving atmosphere. They never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her unconditionally. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family show that you can make the best out of any situation through love and a positive spirit.
30	11856	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, it talks about making a house a home and a community your family. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'Family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The text goes onto talk about how growing up with Italian, Spanish, and Cuban cultures in one community, with all differences aside, made the community into a family. Rodriguez talks very warmly, and with only good things to say about his childhood; the mood of the memoir is Rodriguez remembering his culture-filled childhood with fondness. ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The memoir is a dedication to his life and a reflection of all the experiences had within his family, both given and chosen. He writes his memoirs in loving spirits, dedicating his knowledge of a ""family"" to his own, thus concluding his tribute to the community that shaped him."
31	11857	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is a very important part of the story. The mood in this memoir is definitely thankfulness. The first reason for why the mood of this story is thankfulness is because Narciso is thankful for his Cuban heritage. Rodriguez shows his love for his heritage by stating ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills"". The author is very thankful that he has these skills from his great culture, which connects him deeply to his roots. The second reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his home. ""...Formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", Rodriguez writes in his memoir. This quote shows that Narciso is thankful for a nice and secure place to call his home, a sanctuary for his family. The final reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his hardworking parents. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and i've thank them repeatedly"", he comments. This undoubtably shows the author's great respect for his parents and all they have sacrificed for him to be happy and healthy. Thankfulness is a mood that suits this memoir very well, and the pride and gratefulness that the author shows for his heritage, home, and parents is wonderful and resonates throughout the entire narrative."
32	11858	5	3	"The mood created by the author in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very calm and happy. The author establishes a tone that is very calm and cool, creating a sense of peaceful recollection. There are no loud or emphasized parts, which contributes to the overall serene atmosphere. It is also very happy, as it describes a family growing and getting to love each other over time. The narrative includes friends and more family having happy times and celebrations, which reinforces the joyful feeling. The happiest line was the last, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple little house into a home,"" as it encapsulates the core emotional truth of the writing. It also has a very loving tone to it, which is almost inevitable when the subject is a family coming together and supporting one another through life's journey."
33	11859	5	3	The author could have put a lot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, grateful and appreciative. I said happy because he talks about every thing he does and how he enjoys it, focusing on the positive aspects of his upbringing. I said grateful because he is always thanking his parents and he admires them for their efforts and sacrifices. He admires them because they have come a long way to the good life and they do everything in their power to have a good life and provide for their family. And he appreciates them because of the same thing I said before; he admires them and always thanks them for what they have done for him, recognizing their unwavering support. This combination of happiness, gratitude, and appreciation is the prevailing mood the author has toward writing the story of his family.
34	11860	5	3	"In Narciso's memoir, I feel joy. I feel joy because Narciso's parents were able to survive and thrive despite significant challenges. They came to America, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture,"" which makes their success even more remarkable. Immigrant families do not get on their feet right away, and they did; within a year they went from a one-room apartment to a two-room apartment, showing their rapid progress and determination. Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms for their family and community. People today are losing their jobs and homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go and offered one to others. ""Countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This generous spirit is a profound source of the joy that permeates the memoir."
35	11861	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of gratitude and happiness. The author was grateful for the chance to grow up in the United States. The title of the piece is Narciso Rodriguez. He talks about his life, explaining that he came from Cuba and that his parents welcomed other people who came from Cuba, fostering a strong community. They come ""together in a great solidarity and friendship,"" which highlights the supportive environment. I think his mood is very happy, especially to see that his parents made something out of nothing through sheer hard work. The author's parents showed him with their life, and his teachings have been the basis of his life, instilling in him strong values. I feel the same way because my parents also brought me here for a better life, and I believe you learn everything from your parents, like how to act and persevere. So yes, the last sentence he said I liked it very much. He said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a sentiment that perfectly concludes his reflection on family and belonging."

I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him from his parents. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a genuine blessing that connects him to his heritage. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person, values instilled in him by his family. @PERSON2 quotes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.""

In a time when racism and segregation was normal in @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and his family had many happy times in his home in Newark, New Jersey, finding joy in their togetherness. His town was filled with Cuban, Spanish, and Italian immigrants, creating a rich cultural tapestry. His neighborhood was united and hardworking, supporting one another through challenges. In his memoir, Rodriguez writes about his kind parents. In the memoir, it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (p. @NUM1).

Narciso is grateful for the culinary skills and traditions that his parents passed on to him, which became a cherished part of his identity. Just like me most of my life I lived an apartment and saw it as any other home because of the parents you have there that care for you, providing love and stability. Also growing up in that enviroment taught him family doesn't have to be blood related, it could neighbors or friends that could be like a brother, sister, aunt, uncle, creating a wider, chosen family that offered support and companionship. These lessons in gratitude and the expansive definition of family form the emotional core of his reflections.
42	11868	5	3	The mood in this story was security and happiness. Security was prevailed when all different people with different culture and heritage could live together without fights or arguments at a time when there was a lot of racial tension in the neighborhood, creating a safe haven for him.

46	11872	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" is a open happy familly because her parents worked and made a wonderful home for her. I think the mood in the story is a open happy family becase in the text it says ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood related"" and that @CAPS3 that when @CAPS2 was growing up her family had a bunch of people that were considered family but not blood related. This demonstrates how the concept of family was built on love and community rather than biology. Also the text said ""It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking imigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That just @CAPS3 that her parants let anyone from their community who needed a family become part of their familly, or anybody who was lonley just have some company from them, reinforcing the warm and inclusive atmosphere of their household.

I think that it is a happy mood because Narciso is describing his life, and at the end he says he has a happy life, which frames his entire narrative. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). I think that this is a happy statement because he is saying that his parents cared so much for him, and they turned what could have been a bad house, into a home filled with love and warmth. I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors with such fondness.

55	11881	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is heartwarming. This memoir is heartwarming because it's about how her parents came from Cuba to the United States, seeking a new beginning. It's nice how the blonde-brick house was better but still the same as the house their parents lived in, maintaining a connection to their past. The Cuban music filled the air of the house like it was a house in Cuba, preserving their cultural identity and creating a familiar atmosphere. A house isn't a house until you call it a home, and that family has made that their home forever through love and shared memories. Even though their family can't come down till 1970, they too will have a place to call home like Narciso Rodriguez did, a place filled with the same warmth and heritage.

76	11902	5	3	The mood in this memoir is heritage love and family love. This is showed by the author when he writes about his home and how we learn to love there. All the friendships he had and family moments made him love his home, from the simple daily routines to the special celebrations that filled the house with joy.

Ultimately, the memoir stands as a heartfelt tribute to the place and the people who taught him the deepest meaning of love.
77	11903	5	3	I think the mood is happy. because Spanish cuban and Italian in the same neigh borhood with out fighting, and it seems like they like than life in United States. The author describes a vibrant community where different cultures coexist peacefully, sharing their traditions and foods, which creates a lively and joyful atmosphere. This sense of communal harmony and mutual respect contributes significantly to the overall positive feeling. The narrative suggests a deep appreciation for this unique and friendly environment. Therefore, the prevailing mood is one of contentment and happiness.
78	11904	5	3	I think that the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this because when @CAPS1 was talking throughout the story @CAPS1 talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are. @CAPS1 talked about her life as being very nice because @CAPS1 grew up in a house that turned into a home, filled with constant activity and love. Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today, which are memories that evoke fondness and joy. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet, demonstrating a generous and loving spirit. Lastly, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @CAPS1 had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them, creating a continuous sense of togetherness and support. Those are the reasons I thought the mood set by the author was happiness, as it is a reflection of a cherished and joyful upbringing.
79	11905	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relatives,"" highlighting a definition of family built on love and community. The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" which underscores the deep appreciation for their efforts. The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" emphasizing the emotional security they provided. @CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing, forming the foundational theme of the entire memoir."
80	11906	5	3	"The mood of the author in this memoir was happy, grateful, and gratitude. I say happy because in the story the author said ""in our neighborhood despite customs else where, all of the cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" I say happy because the author was happy to enjoy having so many friends and family to come over everyday and have fun, creating a lively and supportive social world. another mood is grate full the author as it says in the story ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author says this because the authors parents loved him a lot they went out every day trying to get money to make sure the author had a good life and the author was greatful for that. Now the author had gratitude for all the things the author's parents did ""parents created our traditional Cuban home"" also ""passed on to me the rich culonary skills and love for cooking"" and ""where I celebrated my first birthdays"". The author had gratitude for all these things and more because without the things his parents did he wouldn't be who he is today, and this profound sense of thankfulness permeates the entire narrative."
81	11907	5	3	I think the mood in this story was both sad and happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook and he specifically thanked his parents for teaching him this skill. Also, in paragraph @NUM1, there is a paragraph dedicated to his parents, which shows his affection and gratitude. However, I think it is also sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good jobs in their home country, but when they came to the United States they had to start over completely, which suggests a difficult period of loss and adjustment. This blend of gratitude for the present and recognition of past struggles creates a complex emotional tone.
82	11908	5	3	In the memoir the author expressed different moods. One of these moods was appreciative, as he was appreciative that his parents made a house into a home. They made him happy by the way his parents passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking, and their passionate Cuban music which filled the air of his home. The author also expresses how he is grateful that his parents left their families, friends, and successful careers in the country they loved so that they could come to America, start their life over, and have a better life for themselves and for him. This deep sense of thankfulness for their immense sacrifice is a central feeling throughout the narrative.
83	11909	5	3	The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace. He established this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate, maintaining a consistently positive tone. Also, while reading he talks about how he and his family always helped each other out, demonstrating strong bonds of support. He also considers his entire community to be like family, and that inclusive sentiment really makes you feel at peace inside, conveying a powerful sense of belonging and security.
84	11910	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was one of hope. He made it so the reader feels there's still hope, conveying that even if you are an immigrant you can still make it to the top. @PERSON1's family moved from Cuba during a time when racism was legal, facing significant challenges. The neighborhood was described as a family, emphasizing a sense of unity and mutual support. Now Narciso is a famous fashion designer, which serves as proof of this hopeful message. Coming from Cuba with nothing and starting a new life entirely over was very hard, but his ultimate success makes the overall mood inspiring.
85	11911	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created is happy and loving. In the memoir it says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 of people were very close to his family and @CAPS2 found out you don't have to be blood relatives to be family, learning a valuable lesson about chosen kinship. Also it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 is happy his parents moved to @LOCATION1 and is grateful for the sacrifices they had to make to do it. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 went from just living there to it being his true home, and he appreciates all his parents have done to make his life better, which fills the memoir with a warm and thankful atmosphere."
86	11912	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of ""family"". She learned the definition of ""family"" at what she calls it her ""simple house"", a place that was filled with love and mutual support. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says ""It was here where I learned the definition of 'family,'"" indicating that the home itself was the classroom for this vital life lesson. The author reflects on the specific moments and interactions within those walls that shaped her understanding, concluding that family is not just about blood relations but about the shared experiences and unwavering support found in that simple house."
87	11913	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creates a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time, a bittersweet feeling of nostalgia. It is sad because the parents had to leave all of their family, friends, and careers back in Cuba, while coming to @LOCATION1 not knowing the language, which must have been a profoundly difficult and isolating experience. He didn't even get to meet his real grandparents until 1970 when they were finally allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child, making immense sacrifices out of love. He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends, a life built upon his parents' courage and resilience, which ultimately defines the hopeful tone of the memoir."
88	11914	5	3	The mood set by the author is a very happy one, filled with a sense of pride and contentment. This is shown by explaining how happy he is to be a Cuban-@CAPS1 and be free of dark times, embracing his identity with joy. He also shows his happiness by explaining his qualities and family, highlighting the strength and love that surround him. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez wants people to be happy with their lives and family and heritage, to find the same profound satisfaction in their own roots and relationships. That is the uplifting and celebratory mood set by Narciso Rodriguez, encouraging an appreciation for one's personal history.
89	11915	5	3	"In this memoir gives a grateful feeling, a deep appreciation for the community that was built. Some of the reasons I think this is because, like in paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""Öour neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood, a bond that transcended the era's prejudices. This sense of a supportive, familial community, forged in a challenging environment, is the core of his gratitude. And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir, reflecting on the preciousness of such a close-knit community."
90	11916	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood in the story is willing, grateful, and hopeful, reflecting the family's complex emotional journey. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"" that quote represents that the family was willing to go through not having a good job like in cuba and segregation to make a better life for their kids, demonstrating their profound determination. ""My parents always kept there door open for the people we considered family"" this quote shows the family was was grateful to have a home and still let the people they loved live there with them, sharing their blessings. ""My mother and Father came to this country with such courage, with out knowledge of the language and culture."" That quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life, a testament to their optimism. In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the family was willing to do anything for a better life, and this resilient spirit defines the entire narrative."
91	11917	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one of resilience and community, showing that even though they came from Cuba, they could still make a living, become bilingual, and translate to help others find stability. For example, the line, ""Often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" illustrates how the family would provide support until a person could secure a steady job or find an apartment that was affordable and suitable for their monthly income. This practice of mutual aid is further emphasized by the statement, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family,"" highlighting how they would support each other through difficult times. Ultimately, the mood is positive and hopeful because, after their arrival and struggle, they secured an apartment, and everyone found happiness as the place truly became their home."
92	11918	5	3	"I think that the author created a very warming and loving tone. Narciso established this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home, focusing on the sense of community and shared joy found within its walls. For example, in one paragraph he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends, noting that these gatherings ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" creating a vivid picture of a lively and affectionate household. This consistent emphasis on togetherness and cherished memories effectively conveys a deep sense of comfort and belonging, which defines the overall feeling of the narrative and leaves the reader with a strong impression of a loving family environment."
93	11919	5	3	What I think the mood of this story is really soft and explainable since it details how these people immigrated from their country to where they live now just to basically get a better life. And they certainly did achieve that goal. They are happy with their home and the child is happy because of his amazing educational options, which was a central hope driving the family's journey. That is what I would say the mood of this story is—a gentle and satisfied feeling stemming from the fulfillment of their aspirations and the positive outcome of their sacrifices for the next generation's future.
94	11920	5	3	During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his Cuban heritage, as well as his brave parents, who worked diligently to create a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story, filled with positive recollections. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home, and childhood deeply. The achievement was of his parents coming over to a new country and starting a better life from nothing. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is truly important in creating a fulfilling life.
95	11921	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir was very grateful. Narciso was profoundly grateful for the ""house that his parents turned into a home,"" a place filled with love and sacrifice. He was very grateful to his overall parents, for giving up their own life and comforts to try to give their son a better one, with many more opportunities than they had. He is also grateful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but for imparting things they did have, too. These invaluable gifts included teaching him how to cook, how to treat others with respect, and the real meaning of family. They also showed him through their own actions the value of being selfless for someone you love, a lesson that clearly shaped his character and worldview."
96	11922	5	3	No matter what nationality you are you can get along with anyone, a truth embodied by the welcoming spirit of his family. He shows that his home, to him at least was a wonderful sanctuary with nice smells, delicious food, and warm people. He is unexplainable happy and grateful for what his Parents did for him, creating a space of pure comfort. To him it was a paradise/heaven on earth, a perfect refuge from the outside world. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in the humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not Just scent and music but love and life, a vibrant center of daily existence. He will never forget that house or its gracious neigh bor hood, which remains a cherished memory in his heart.
97	11923	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author through vivid recollections. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family and culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy and celebratory. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" this quot was found in the text, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous, extending their love freely. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much, a rich tapestry of traditions. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, creating a complete picture of his upbringing, and that last quot ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" found in the concluding section really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally and solidifying the memoir's heartfelt tone."
98	11924	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be I believe love, a deep and abiding affection. I said love because basically throughout the whole story all that was being talked about was ""eternal devotion"", ""a dore"", bonds, and unity, all facets of a loving family. The family are imigrants and they came looking for a better lifestyle in a foreign country Just for the benefit of the children, a selfless act. From my point of view only loving parent would give up The country they all love in order to do something like that because they had to leave behind families, friends, and careers, sacrificing everything familiar. Now their facing cultural hardships over Just one desition, yet their love provides the strength to persevere through these challenges."
99	11925	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is very warm and inviting, enveloping the reader in a sense of comfort. It is of home and family, core themes that resonate throughout the narrative. Some examples of this are, he mentioen that the kitchen was the heart of the home, a place of gathering, and the Cuban music was playing all the time, filling the rooms with rhythm. The memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting, creating a constant, joyful noise. He also mentions there was rarely a time when was not staying with them in their home until they got back on their feet, highlighting their generous hospitality. The mood of this memoir is warming and of family, leaving a lasting impression of a loving household.
100	11926	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very adventorous, tracing the family's journey to a new life. In the memoir it showed how Narciso's parent's and relatives moved, seeking opportunity and stability. At first Narciso lived in a furnished one-room apartment, a modest beginning, then they could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment that was soon to be Narciso's beloved home. Narciso was born in 1961, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey, which grounds his story in a specific time and place. Narciso grew up with his family for a while in this environment, surrounded by a supportive community. ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but was defined by love and mutual support. Narciso will always be greatful and loving to his parents for what they did for him, providing him with a foundation of courage and love."
101	11927	5	3	In the author's memoir the author creates a distinct mood, and that mood in the story is one of happiness and enjoyment. It is a mood of happiness and joy because he was genuinely happy for his home and how his parents were cooks, which provided a warm and nourishing environment. He also clearly joyed the music and the various things he does with his family and relatives, which contributed to this positive atmosphere. I think this is the specific mood the author intentionally used throughout the memoir to convey his cherished childhood experiences.
102	11928	5	3	In his memoir about growing up in a new environment with his family, Narciso Rodriguez establishes a definite and consistent mood. The mood, to put it in general terms, is overwhelmingly happy and positive. The author deliberately did not put any negative information in the memoir and only focused on cultivating a positive feeling for the reader. In paragraph two, the author explains in detail how his parents brought their vibrant Cuban heritage into their home through elements like food, music, frequent family gatherings, and fun celebrations. All of these cultural traditions set a very happy and welcoming backdrop for the family's life. In paragraph four, Narciso further shows that there was always a stream of people over and everyone was having a fun time together; Narciso's surrogate grandparents, babysitter, cousins, and aunts and uncles all came and consistently had a good time. Finally, in paragraph six, the author sums it all up and tells the reader that he will always be profoundly grateful for his parents' love and immense sacrifice. His parents were thanked repeatedly by him for their demonstrated strength and perseverance, and they taught him the vital lesson that friends and family are very important. Overall, this memoir successfully maintained a very positive and happy mood from beginning to end.
103	11929	5	3	"Home and family is the one thing all of us truly love and cherish. The mood the author created was heartwarming and full of appreciation, because he explains how comfortable and welcoming his home was with everyone together, always having a good time and supporting one another. It was not only just about being together but about the quality of that togetherness, as illustrated by the idea that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in him a great sense that 'family' has nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez shows his deep appreciation for his parents, whom he loved so much because they had to make an important and difficult change to give him a better life which he deserved. They had bravely made this change ""even though it meant leaving behind their families."" Such bravery and sacrifice they had demonstrated for his future. The author ultimately left us knowing his profound appreciation for his ""home,"" being eternally grateful for his parents and his rich hispanic heritage that shaped his world."
104	11930	5	3	"The author successfully created a specific mood throughout the memoir. The author creates the consistent mood of friendliness and communal harmony. I know this because in the text it provides a clear example, stating ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This means that even though there was segregation and division around them, their particular neighborhood was still a place of friendliness and unity, where people from different backgrounds connected. All and all, the author effectively created this warm and inviting mood in the memoir, emphasizing the power of community."
105	11931	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is excellent and deeply moving. For example, in one paragraph it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote gives me the feeling of thankfulness and inspires me to really admire and reflect on what my own parents have done for me. Another powerful example is in a later paragraph where it says ""It was here I learned the real definition of family."" This particular quote makes me feel so happy and fortunate that I have a family that supports me and is always there for me through thick and thin. This memoir really changed how I look at things and made me realize more than ever how truly thankful I am to have my family in my life."
106	11932	5	3	"The way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. He had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house, which is perfectly captured in the line: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The mood of the memoir was happy and uplifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house, creating a constant sense of community. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Furthermore, the mood of the memoir was vividly brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. He recalls it as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy, and his tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich cultural upbringing. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents directly, stating, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Ultimately, the mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author's fond and grateful recollections."
107	11933	5	3	The mood changed throughout the memoir, reflecting the family's journey. First the mood started off as depressing by describing the initial struggle in Cuba where they had a one-room furnished apartment. This feeling of hardship continued upon their arrival in a new country, until the point when they could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment, which marked a significant improvement. Next, the mood became inspiring. It was inspiring because the parents, despite being a poor family, found a way to move out of Cuba for a better future. This was further emphasized by the fact that his parents were selflessly getting out of Cuba so their children could have a better place to live and thrive. Lastly, there was a prevailing mood of family and community. They were honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to help people in need, embodying a generous spirit. Also, they always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogate grandparents Sergio and other close friends there too, creating a warm, familial atmosphere. The mood changed throughout the whole memoir from depressing to inspiring and to family, which it always was about at its very core.
108	11934	5	3	Narciso was very proud of his Cuban culture and the values instilled in him. He was very happy with who he had become, and how he had been raised, which set a very proud and grateful tone for this memoir. He explains a central belief that family is not solely about blood relations; it is about people who love each other and are going to be there for each other through thick and thin. He told us that his parents passed on the Cuban culture to him, notably through traditions like cooking, which became a cherished part of his life. He also explained with admiration how his parents built the home on their own, the very home that he got to grow up in, which was a testament to their hard work. Narciso says how proud he is to be a Cuban, and how his family works incredibly hard to earn a living and provide opportunities. Narciso told us how proud and happy he was, to be in a nice home, surrounded by friends, family, and the promise of a future. He told us he learned to love, to appreciate his heritage, and to value the community that supported him.
109	11935	5	3	He loved his parents deeply and cherished his home. His most vivid memories of his birthday are of them always being there, with the sounds of Cuban music always filling the air and mixing with the always-present, comforting smell of Cuban food that defined his childhood.
110	11936	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the author creates a complex mood of hardship and gratefulness. This is established early on, as seen on page one: ""after living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, my parents could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home."" This illustrates the initial hardship of how they moved from Cuba to a new country and had to leave everything behind to start a new life from nothing, in a small, little apartment. The memoir then shifts to express profound gratefulness because Narciso is very grateful for his family's sacrifice for his future and for their unwavering caring and love. This is clear when he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I think the memoir is a very heartwarming story of a family that loves one another and is thankful that they have a place they can finally call home, a sentiment that resonates throughout the entire narrative."
111	11937	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfullness. The reasons that it is thankful is because of the frequent refrences made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents. This is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the author said ""they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrears in the country they loved"" This quote from @CAPS1 @NUM1 shows how grateful Narciso is of his parents leaving everything they had to make a better life for him, highlighting their profound sacrifice.

This is showing that the mood is Grateful because Narciso means that he's is thankful because they were able to turn their little house into a place of great friendships and great times, a true sanctuary. The last reason this article has a mood relative to thankfullness is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM3 when Narciso says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This sentence shows that no matter what Narciso does he can never repay his parents for their selflessness and care, a debt of love. The reason this article is also happy is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM4 when he talks of ""the endless celebrations"" or ""a love of cooking that is still with me today... ""This is showing the ""mood is happy and joyous because it is clear that as a boy the kitchen and cooking were a source of happiness and @CAPS2 in his home, filled with vibrant life.

113	11939	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was happy, loving, and warm. The memoir is basically about family and how important family is. When you talk about your family, and its culture, you usually dont feel sad about it. Throughout the memoir. the author says things like, ""a love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""formed a backdrop to life in our warm home,"" illustrating enduring positive memories. The author also talks about the selflessness of his parents, which he is very proud and gratefull for. He states in paragraph @NUM1, that his parents, ""kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family,"" demonstrating their inclusive and generous spirit. The author also states in paragraph @NUM2 that, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" expressing his deep respect. Their are many mood set by the author of this memoir. But there is no doubt that he aimed for this memoir to be happy and uplifting and truely touching, successfully conveying a heartfelt appreciation for his upbringing."
114	11940	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author uses words such as warm to describe things. ""Warm homes"" gives you a happy feeling @CAPS1 two gives you a happy mood overal. It makes you think about how happy the author is knowing they still have their family memories/skills, a lasting source of joy. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author using many words which set the mood of happiness, like ""warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home. These choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood, painting a vivid picture of a cherished and joyful past. The cumulative effect of this positive language firmly establishes the memoir's uplifting and cheerful atmosphere."
115	11941	5	3	"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house, creating a sensory experience of comfort. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, @CAPS1, and cousins, which emphasizes the constant presence of loved ones. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun, infused with love and community. This transformation from a mere building to a beloved home is the ultimate expression of the warm mood that permeates the entire memoir."
116	11942	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a grateful and loving mood. Firstly, the author creates a grateful mood. He's grateful for his parents and how they sacrificed by moving to a new location. They had to face racism in a nation where it was prevalent. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and racism prevailed in the United States."" They wanted their son to have a good life, and he recognizes their struggles. The author creates a grateful mood through this acknowledgment. Lastly, the author creates a loving mood. He feels a loving mood because his family loved and took care of him. He considered his neighbors his family, creating a strong sense of community. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" They loved many people who they knew they could trust, reinforcing this warm and affectionate atmosphere. To conclude, the author effectively creates both a grateful and a loving mood throughout his memoir."
117	11943	5	3	"In his own memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, we are told about his childhood. Narciso affects the mood by describing the setting with specific details. He writes ""could afford to move into a modest three room apartment..."" which gives you a humble feeling from the very beginning of the reading. This description establishes a tone of simplicity and modesty. In another part, he writes ""passionate Cuban music filled the air..."". This evocative line made me think of his vibrant Cuban culture and the sensory experiences of his youth. Narciso writes things like these throughout his memoir, consistently building the atmosphere. These lines give the mood of modesty and rich Cuban culture, painting a vivid picture of his early environment. Narciso also writes about his birthday and family, and the parts that he writes about family give you a feeling of unity and togetherness. These are the lines and phrases Narciso uses to give his memoir its distinct and memorable mood."
118	11944	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a specific and consistent mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood. I say this because the author is talking about how he is grateful, or thankful, to his parents for teaching him important things and for bringing him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close. He reflects on the values instilled in him and the supportive community that surrounded his family. This deep sense of appreciation for his upbringing and the sacrifices made for him permeates the narrative. The author's tone is one of heartfelt thanks, which solidifies the overall grateful mood of the memoir.
119	11945	5	3	"The author created a strong sense of love and care in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez. The author talked about the sense of family and how people don't have to all be the same to become one community. One part explains ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" The author shared the feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one ""family"" in a racist environment. The author also shared how his parents made the difficult decision to move to the new place, leaving loved ones behind for their children's better future. The author showed a lot of admiration for his parents based on what they did for him and how they always had other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals. In another passage the author says ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author shares his deep feelings of love and appreciation toward his parents throughout this memoir."
120	11946	5	3	The mood that was created by the author is profoundly loving. It teaches the reader that the heartfelt sacrifice and hardship the parents endured is priceless and the love that an immigrant family has for one another is endless. This mood explains the true definition of family and the unconditional, unfading love that a family has for one another and for its neighbor. This is true because in one paragraph it tells the reader how grateful the author is for having such persistent, loving parents whose faith and determination for a better future taught the author how to love and appreciate the courage and strength one must have to overcome the struggles and barriers on this pursuit of happiness everyone is destined to follow. The mood of this memoir explains how precious a home is and the memories contained within it, emphasizing the enduring power of familial bonds. This is the consistent and powerful mood the author created in his memoir.
121	11947	5	3	The mood that's created by the author in the memoir is a complex blend of happiness and a lingering sadness or sense of loss. Happiness is one prevailing mood because the author warmly describes how his family has settled and lived in New Jersey and how his family was not the only one to immigrate from their country. Their entire neighborhood is made up of a vibrant community of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, which provided a sense of belonging. The author has also made a few friends, his first one being Alegria, the landlord's daughter, which added to his joyful experiences. But the author did show some sadness when he reflected on how he and his family had left Cuba. They had left behind dear friends, close family, stable jobs, and their country that they had deeply loved. This bittersweet feeling is poignantly captured by the fact that the author still listens to Cuban music when he does cook, preserving a tangible connection to the home he left behind.
122	11948	5	3	"The mood that the author sets is one of profound thankfulness. He is overwhelmingly thankful for all the things and the immense sacrifices his parents had to make for him. For example, he writes, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This powerful statement encapsulates the depth of their selfless love and the high cost of their decision. This is precisely why the author wrote this memoir, to formally and sincerely thank his parents for what they did for him and to honor their enduring legacy of sacrifice."
123	11949	5	3	In the memoir the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a consistent mood of faith throughout the reading. As the author describes his parents moving into the United States, it tells how they had to courageously leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The primary motivation to do so reveals the parents' deep faith in creating a new home just as good as the one before. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents' faith that has traveled so far over time and remained strong. Rodríguez believes his parents have more courage than anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others, always having their arms open to help those in need. It was the parents' unwavering faith that the struggles would lead them and their children to better times that drove them to endure these hard times with such resilience and hope.
124	11950	5	3	The mood that is created by the author in the memoir is one of friendship. Throughout the whole memoir the author writes about how everyone is friendly and connected to each other. The narrative shows how the whole memoir is about friendship, illustrating the bonds that form within a community. This central theme of companionship and mutual support is woven into the fabric of the story, highlighting the importance of these relationships in the author's life and providing a warm, cohesive atmosphere from beginning to end.
125	11951	5	3	"Reading this article expresses many different moods from the author. While reading you can notice he's proud of his Cuban culture, explaining how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most importantly, he is so grateful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him succeed in life, and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is essentially about giving thanks to his parents and celebrating his culture. His mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story, which is evident in moments like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of 'family',"" meaning his family was always there for each other and love was all over. This passage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I succeed, so I can say I can relate to the author and his profound sense of gratitude and cultural pride."
126	11952	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is one of profound gratitude. Narciso is telling the story in honor of his parents' immense selflessness and the sacrifices they made for his future. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, leaving behind everything familiar to build a new life from nothing. They worked as hard as they could, taking on any job available, and through their relentless effort, they made him a home and a childhood he could truly be happy with. This deep-seated appreciation for their struggles and love forms the emotional core of his recollections, framing his entire narrative with a sense of thankfulness for the opportunities they provided.
127	11953	5	3	The mood of the author is happy because he loves his home and it is where he really wants to be. He feels a deep sense of belonging and comfort in the environment his family created. He also loves his culture and where he came from, cherishing the traditions and values of his heritage. He loves his parents dearly and appreciates the skills and lessons they gave him during his childhood, which shaped the person he became. That deep connection to his family, his roots, and his home is why his overall mood is very happy and content.
128	11954	5	3	The mood that the author of this memoir creates is one of love and togetherness. The way that he describes his parents' hard work and love is incredible, highlighting their profound dedication. First, it says that in Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering, yet in the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. This demonstrates love beyond comparison, seeing as they had to start over from scratch, stepping down far beneath their potential to care for their children. They never gave up but instead kept going to try and give their children a better life than they would have had. Also, this memoir expresses togetherness not only in the family but in the community as a whole. As it says, their neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. Even though they were of all kinds of races, it was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. This was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite race. His parents also kept their doors open and allowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet, knowing that others would do the same for them. This takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throughout this memoir that illustrate the powerful mood the author creates of love and togetherness.
129	11955	5	3	I will always be grateful to my parents for their unconditional love and tremendous sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done, leaving their homeland to ensure a better future for our family. Their strength in facing an unknown country and their perseverance through countless hardships have left a permanent mark on my life. I recognize that every opportunity I have is built upon the foundation of their struggles, a debt I can never fully repay but will always honor through my own actions and remembrance of their journey.
130	11956	5	3	This memoir presented one overarching theme that meant many different things. One clear theme was being helpful. The family moved to the United States from Cuba in 1956 and had to endure many hardships and struggles of their own. Because they knew what that felt like, they decided to help other struggling people, and they let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did, offering shelter and support. Another theme that I thought fit was inspiration. I think this family not only inspired their children with their resilience but also other neighbors and relatives who witnessed their generosity. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart-felt. The family risked everything they had to help other families in similar situations, acting out of genuine compassion. That was a very noble action they took upon themselves. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did, creating a ripple effect of kindness within their community.
131	11957	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, is clear in the memoir. You can sense throughout the whole story that he is completely grateful to his parents for the love they gave him, and their home life. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"". Rodriguez is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents who ""unwittingly passed on to meet their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". They always had Passionate Cuban music that filled the air ""Mixing with kitchen aromas,"" creating a vibrant and sensory-rich environment. At the end of paragraph @NUM1, he says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family + friends, and endless celebrations form the backdrop to life in our warm home. I will never forget how my parents turned this house into a home."" This deep and abiding appreciation for his upbringing is the central feeling conveyed in his writing."
132	11958	5	3	The author was speaking very proudly and happy about her parents. The author explained how her parents were very courageous and brave for leaving their home land. That's because neither of them spoke english, which made the transition to a new country incredibly difficult. Also because they had to leave their lives back at home and start all over again, facing unknown challenges with determination. They embarked on this journey to build a better future, demonstrating immense strength in the face of adversity. The author's tone is one of profound respect and admiration for the sacrifices they made.
133	11959	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is happy. It is happy because it is a talking about Narciso's memories, which are filled with warmth and fondness for his past. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood is also appreciative. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" The mood is also sad, touched by a poignant sense of nostalgia and the weight of gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" So there was several moods in this memoir, creating a complex and heartfelt emotional landscape that reflects a deeply personal journey."
134	11960	5	3	"In this excerpt, Narciso Rodriguez describes his childhood home and extended ""family."" The mood of this duration is very warm and happy. Narciso speaks of his childhood home with only love and affection. @CAPS1's eternally grateful to his parents for turning ""... this simple house into a home,"" a place filled with love and security. @CAPS1 speakes admirably of his parents and the sacrifices and hard work they went through to even get to @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 is so thankful they did for the life it provided. @CAPS1 also speakes lovingly of his ""extended family"" and describes his neighborhood, noting how ""In our neighborhood..., all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This loving, supporting ""family"" made Narciso who is is today and made him appreciate the fact that ""' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" a valuable lesson he carried into adulthood. But instead is composed of those whom you love and who love you, a definition of family that he clearly holds dear."
135	11961	5	3	Happy. You should always be proud where you came from. Not only that back your background like your culture and your parents, for these elements are the foundation of your identity. Stuff like that. Never be ashamed about stuff like that even if your diffrent it shouldn't matter, as diversity is a strength. The more diffrent you're the more unique you're, which is something to be celebrated. Just look at it that way. Plus you should never change just because of what you're and what you look like; staying true to yourself is the greatest form of respect you can offer your heritage and your own spirit. Embracing your unique story is the key to genuine confidence and happiness.
136	11962	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Rodriguez created a mood of gratefulness toward his mother and father. Numerous times, he wanted to thank his mother and father for their profound influence on his life. For example, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Narciso Rodriguez is so grateful for his parents because they left Cuba to start a new life in the United States. They sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind, facing an uncertain future. In the text, it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" His parents sacrificed so much just to give Rodriguez a better life and that is precisely why he creates the consistent mood of gratefulness throughout his memoir, honoring their journey and its impact on him."
137	11963	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is united, caring, loving and more. The author is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about; yourself, memories, family and etc. A reason why the author created these moods is because a home is where a family lives together and where they hold memories together which shows loving. For example in the memoir, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Which is obviously the mood of loving, because they are all a loving family together. A second reason why the author created these moods is because in the place where the author lived there were many different people from different places. Even though they all weren't the same they acted as a family and were united. For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" which means that even though they are different they are going to be there for one another which is united. A third reason why the author created these moods is because the author's parents weren't just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children. For example, ""They come selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Which means her parents weren't just caring about them but the future for their son. The whole story is based on home and family but the thing is that a home and family will always share the love, caring and unity of one another, which is the central theme the author successfully conveys."
138	11964	5	3	"The mood of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very much the same throughout the whole excerpt. In the story, the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed. Narciso talks about his family and how much he loves them and what they have done for him, reflecting on his childhood with a sense of peace. It says in the story ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Very much throughout the story, this is the prevailing mood. Another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is thankful to his parents for their selflessness and the opportunities they provided. In the story, Narciso says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too, sharing in his appreciation. Narciso Rodriguez creates happy moods for us by the way he writes with love about his family and how he cares so much about what they did for him, leaving the reader with a warm and positive feeling."
139	11965	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is thankful and proud. In the text it shows that he is thankful, as seen in the line, ""... still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" It also shows that Narciso Rodriguez is proud to be Cuban and of his heritage. In another part, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also shows that Narciso is thankful for everything his parents did for him, highlighting their dedication. Narciso also said that he often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance, further emphasizing his deep gratitude. In the last paragraph, it says that he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home. This shows that he is thankful for his parents and the loving environment they created, concluding the memoir with a powerful sense of appreciation."
140	11966	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is in the following. In the first paragraph, it describes a couple coming to America from Cuba who settles down and has a baby. Within the story, it describes their life here in America, what their house is like and the importance of cooking and music from Cuba, which they preserved in their new life. In Newark, New Jersey this family invites friends and family for dinner and such; the author describes how it brought everyone together and the mood of unity and happiness that these gatherings fostered. The mood of this memoir is happiness and unity which was created by the author through these vivid recollections of shared meals and cultural traditions that strengthened family and community bonds.
141	11967	5	3	The mood of this excerpt is happy. It's clear there are many things he could be happy for. The fact that his parents, as children, didn't live in great circumstances and yet worked to allow their children to have a better life is a great source of joy for him. The warmth of the home and the shared experiences within it are also pivotal, bringing the family closer together and creating a foundation of love and security that defines his happy upbringing.
142	11968	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of caring and happiness. There is a lot of caring evident because he deeply cares about his family and appreciates all that they do for him. He also cares that his parents made the house traditional, just like back in Cuba, preserving their heritage. Furthermore, he cares that his parents do so much for other people, extending their kindness beyond the family. There is a lot of happiness because he is happy to live in his community and to have such wonderful parents. He is happy that his parents teach him all the traditional things that they used to do in Cuba, keeping their culture alive. Last but not least, he is happy because he lives with everyone he loves, surrounded by a supportive and affectionate family unit.
143	11969	5	3	"The author created a good mood in the memoir because, when you think about how steadfast those people were, you have a warm feeling inside. The parents left their country and came to another without any knowledge of her language and her culture, which was a tremendous challenge. They had to start over their lives with the jobs they could find because they wanted a good life for their child, demonstrating profound sacrifice. They handed a hand to people who were in need, considered all their neighbors as family, and they taught their children the real definition of ""family"" through their actions and unwavering generosity of spirit."
144	11970	5	3	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is grateful and happy. The author is very grateful because he acknowledges his parents' sacrifice, stating they moved ""...To give their children a better life."" His parents gave up what they were doing in their homeland Cuba to come live in a new country to make a better life for their child to start off and live in. The author recognizes this but also knows he can never do enough to thank them. Next, the idea that ""family has nothing to do with blood relatives"" shows he is very grateful and thankful that he grew up in the neighborhood he did, where everyone was treated like brothers and sisters and they all felt safe in the community they created. Also, the story says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" The author knows that it took a lot of heart to do that much for someone else when all it did for his parents was make their life tougher. They had to start over completely, and that immense sacrifice is what made him most grateful for his parents, defining the overall mood of the story."
145	11971	5	3	The mood in this story by Narciso Rodriguez was warm and nostalgic, centered on the home where he shared many memories and feelings. His family would let people into their house who were friends or family, creating an open and welcoming atmosphere. This constant flow of loved ones contributed to a sense of community and belonging, making the house a vessel for cherished experiences and emotional connections that defined his youth.
146	11972	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives is a magnificent and welcoming mood. A family move to the United States from Cuba so there the children could have a better education and future. They have a nice home, nice friends, and a good and caring family that supports one another. The neighbor, landlord, or friend Alegria makes them dinner some times, adding to the sense of community. Also, they have friends that go over for dinner and often bring some food over with them, sharing in the meals. They have a family and friends that were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people, creating a vibrant cultural mix. They always had their door open for friend and family and most of their friends would go over every night to socialize and connect. They would let people stay at their house if they needed help or if they had to rest, offering a safe haven. The overall mood was truly magnificent and heartwarming in this story, illustrating a life filled with generosity and connection."
147	11973	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood, that is overall cheerful, warm, and happy. He does this effectively through his deliberate word choice. For instance, he writes that his parents ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" He decribes his parents cooking skills as ""rich"" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive, which conveys a deep sense of appreciation and joy. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people, stating that ""all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close and supportive relationship with all the people in his community. Another example is when he says, the home ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love."" You can feel the warmth and vitality of the room with the adjectives he uses, which are full of sensory detail. This is how the author skillfully creates the uplifting and positive mood throughout the story."
148	11974	5	3	In this memoir, the author touches upon serious facts while giving the memoir a fun and happy mood overall. For example, in one paragraph they talked about how others who aren't even related to them come to do different activities with them, creating a lively atmosphere, while still touching upon a serious topic about how his real grandparents weren't allowed to leave Cuba until 1970, which shows a backdrop of struggle. The author also shows how even though they struggled and went through hardships in their home in New Jersey, they were still able to keep their Cuban culture going along with the music they played and the food they shared, preserving their heritage. He portrays a mood that shows you can be happy and find joy in community no matter what the hardships you endure, emphasizing resilience and the power of a positive spirit. This blend of difficult history with present contentment defines the memoir's unique tone.
149	11975	5	3	The mood of the memoir from Home: The Blueprint of Our Lives is a deeply grateful one. Narciso tells the story about the way he grew up in New Jersey, raised by his loving Cuban parents who had immigrated for a better life. Narciso is very grateful that his parents had taught him to cook and introduced him to Cuban music which he still loves and cherishes today. Narciso is profoundly grateful for having parents who have given him much love and sacrifice, always putting family first. Narciso also admires his parents for their persaverence and strength in facing the challenges of building a new life in a different country. He has thanked them so many times but he feels he can't fully show them how truly grateful he is of them for all they have done. Throughout the memoir Narciso talks about his gratefulness for his upbringing and family, which he consistently sets as the prevailing mood of the narrative.
150	11976	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is initially depressing, marked by a sense of loss and difficulty. I think that because it talks about his parents getting immigrated, which involved leaving their homeland and facing the challenges of starting over in a new country, which is a somber experience. The narrative carries this weight, reflecting on the hardships and the pain of separation from their original culture and family. and then the end is sort of happy, because his parents turned it into a home, filling it with love, music, and the warmth of community despite the initial struggles. This transformation shows how they built a new life, ultimately creating a positive outcome from a difficult beginning. The mood thus evolves from one of sadness to one of hope and contentment.
151	11977	5	3	The mood that the author has in the memoir is greatful because she keeps talking about her parents and how they gave up their lives in Cuba for her. She reflects on the immense personal cost of their decision, leaving behind a familiar world to provide her with greater opportunities. Her tone is consistently one of deep appreciation and indebtedness for this profound sacrifice. The author's gratitude is the central and most powerful feeling conveyed throughout her recollections, shaping her entire perspective on the life she was able to have as a result of her parents' courage and love.
152	11978	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to help the reader better relate to his life's story. The mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family, evoking a sense of security and comfort. As the memoir continues, the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents. He describes how their selfless acts of leaving Cuba and creating a new life in @LOCATION1, helped create a strong foundation for him to grow up on. He says how his parents left behind their friends, family and jobs in the hope that their children would have a better life. His parents came to @LOCATION1, with no knowledge of the language and having to endure many hardships in finding and keeping jobs, facing uncertainty and starting from nothing.

The author also gives a sad and somber mood at one point in the memoir.

166	11992	5	3	I think the author's mood was kind of like a deep sense of belonging and comfort, which is @CAPS1.

The overall atmosphere is one of pure, unadulterated joy, which leaves a lasting impression of an idealized childhood.
177	12003	5	3	"The mood in this memoir was predominantly soft, with a single, notable exception. The mood is soft because it carries a nice, thankful tone that clearly conveys how grateful the narrator is for his parents and their diligent care. It is also saying that there was racism and segregation, so in that particular paragraph, which is the exception, the mood becomes rougher and more difficult, reflecting a ""rough life"" having to deal with such harsh realities. Returning to the soft mood, the narrator also mentions his friend and her act of putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, which is reminiscent of a community helping out during tough times by sometimes cooking meals. This was a nice gesture by Alegria. Furthermore, the way they would house family members until they were back on their feet, and the reciprocal feeling that their family would do the same for them, adds to this gentle atmosphere. Lastly, the final sentence of the last paragraph, which gives the sense of them taking a house and turning it into a home, provides a deeply comforting feeling. All of these elements collectively give off the soft sense, meaning the overall impression is one of kindness and gratitude."

179	12005	5	3	In this memoir, there are many different moods that the author conveys to the reader. Happiness is a primary mood that the author describes, as they are all happy because they can be together and have a great time as a family. Another significant mood is caring; her parents care deeply about others and keep their doors open for them at all times, offering help and shelter. Love is also a mood that permeates the narrative, as love is all around this house. They love all their friends and family and celebrate with them no matter the occasion. They also show their love by letting people stay with them until they can get back up onto their feet. One further mood in this memoir is courage; these two people show immense courage when they arrive and they maintain that courage for a very long time, especially since they came from having such great jobs to ones that aren't that great, demonstrating their resilience and strength in the face of adversity.
180	12006	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is both sad and happy because he talks about sorrowful things that happened to his parents while also recalling the happy moments of their lives. The author seems sad because his parents ultimately died, but he could also be happy while remembering the good times they shared. The narrator reflects that he would likely feel both sad and happy if his own parents passed away, appreciating the memories while mourning the loss. This complex emotional response is why the mood created by the author is a mixture of sadness and happiness. He provides context by mentioning, ""My Parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the united states in 1956. In 1961, I was born into this simple house,"" which suggests he was happy about where he was born and the life his parents built, even while acknowledging their eventual passing."

He keeps stating over and over that he is so grateful for his parents and family members, emphasizing the depth of his appreciation. Also, he describes that his house was always filled with amazing smells and vibrant Cuban music, which contributed to the warm atmosphere. It also says that there was always a palpable feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced, providing a crucial emotional anchor. Another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race, everyone got along and helped others out, creating a strong sense of community. And one final way I know he had a happy mood, is that he said everyone was honest and hard working, values that fostered mutual respect and a positive environment.
182	12008	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful and reflective. The author proved that it doesn't take a great amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy, highlighting the value of intangible riches. Sometimes its just the simple things that create the most profound joy and contentment. In the text it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were, bound by mutual care and respect. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned, underscoring the author's enduring gratitude."
183	12009	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir through his descriptions of unity and tradition. When he told that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" it signaled to me that they all must be happy together, united by a shared spirit of cooperation. And when Rodriguez describes how all of the Cuban traditions his parents brought blended seamlessly into their new life, it just made me think he was comfortable with his home and deeply connected to his cultural roots. This blending of the old with the new fostered a secure and welcoming environment, which is central to the comforting mood he conveys."
184	12010	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the excerpt is very thankful and appreciative. Phrases like ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" and ""I will always be grateful to my parents"" that are scattered throughout the excerpt show greatfulness, and profound love for his parents. Some other examples like ""They came selflessly"" and ""... To give their children a better life"" further illustrate the theme of sacrifice. Throughout the excerpt he tries to express how greatful he is to his parents, and to the wider community that supported him. One quote that came to mind when reading is ""It takes a village to raise a child"" I think thats how the author's community worked, with everyone contributing to the well-being of all. They weren't just neighbors, they were family, bound together by a shared commitment to one another."
185	12011	5	3	"The moods created by the author in the memoir are happiness, love, and gratitude, which are woven together throughout the narrative. To start, it made me feel happy because of the way he described his house, and how delightful it was with its lively atmosphere. ""cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting, almost as if I were there. Secondly, it made me feel loving toward my own loved ones like my family and friends, inspiring a sense of warmth. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..."" I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to take their home country to the United States with them, preserving our heritage. Finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family, and friends for their support and presence in my life. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would be grateful also, recognizing the profound debt we owe to those who care for us. That is how this memoir makes me feel once I read it, leaving me with a renewed sense of appreciation."
186	12012	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is like a mellowish mood, almost like a fun loving feeling. The author had literally put himself into the memoir as I read, which made the narrative feel personal and immersive. Paragraph two, for instance, had used parentheses several times within the text. These parentheses had given the author's personal look into his reality, offering brief, reflective asides. Which had helped to create a calm mellow feel, adding a layer of thoughtful intimacy. Over all the mood was fairley simple, fun, and warmly reflective. In the last sentence it stated that the author had said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It had basically described that the family did not have much, but made the best of what they did have, emphasizing contentment over material wealth. The last sentence had made the whole memoir have a calm mellowish feel, leaving the reader with a sense of peaceful appreciation. In conclusion, the author in the memoir had created a mellow feeling throughout the whole memoir, establishing a consistent tone of fond remembrance."
187	12013	5	3	"The mood in the exerpt is in between grateful and caring and hard because thats what @PERSON1's mood ended they way it was created was by the type of house he was living in with them and and also the people @PERSON1 wrote about. The modest living conditions contributed to this complex emotional tone. Also another mood is comfortable for example when he said ""I was born in Newark, @LOCATION2, in a simple house"" which explains his mood towards everything, suggesting a sense of acceptance and ease despite any hardships. This statement establishes a foundation of unpretentious beginnings. The overall feeling is one of warmth and resilience, shaped by both place and people. Therefore, the excerpt blends these emotions to convey a deeply personal and appreciative perspective."
188	12014	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a feeling of greatfulness for his parents. Narciso Rodriguez is deeply grateful to his parents for coming to the United States with immense courage, leaving behind their familiar lives. @CAPS2 realizes that they came to this country with the primary goal to give their children better lives and opportunities. His parents had no knowledge of the @CAPS1 language, which presented a significant barrier. Rodriguez's parents had good jobs in Cuba, and had to start their lives from scratch, all for Narciso, demonstrating their profound sacrifice. Rodriguez has ""often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly,"" showing his direct and heartfelt appreciation. @CAPS2 is grateful to his parents for turning his small house into a home in which family is valued more than materialistic things, highlighting their true priorities. The first sentence of paragraph six, Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is an extremely good indicator that the mood created by the author is a profound sense of greatfulness for his parents, which resonates as the central theme of the memoir."
189	12015	5	3	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a very warm peaceful and interesting mood. The way the author described the way she used to live looks like she lived a very loving and peaceful enviroment, filled with strong family bonds. She also creates a spanish theme to it which I could relate to, infusing the narrative with cultural richness. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she says she is very passionate for Cuban music and she's grateful she know how to cook, details that anchor the memoir in a specific heritage. She also said in paragraph @NUM2 she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home, a sentiment that underscores the value of love over luxury. That quote makes the mood of the memoir loving and deeply appreciative of familial devotion. The overall atmosphere is one of comfort and cultural pride, making the memoir both engaging and heartfelt."
190	12016	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is gratefullness, happyness and remembrance. Narciso is pround and thankfull of his parents, of them coming all this way by themselves and having to start their whole lives over, as he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" They came to @LOCATION1 specifically ""to give their children a better life,"" a dream that motivated all their actions. They struggled, taking any job that they could find, regardless of their previous status. They struggled for him, so he didn't have to struggle, a selfless act he deeply recognizes. Narcisco admires them for ""their strength and perseverance,"" virtues he holds in high esteem. Narciso sets the mood in the memoir as gratefulness to his parents and for all that they have done for him, which forms the emotional core. He is happy with the life they have created for him, and is happy that they have done so well, noting, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a testament to their ability to create warmth from simplicity.

191	12017	5	3	The author created a calm and reflective mood throughout the narrative. Everything he talks about is presented in the same measured and even tone, establishing a consistent atmosphere. When he talks about the kitchen in his home, he also created a happy mood, yet it is described with the same underlying tranquility. He was similarly calm while talking about the memories in his old home, recounting them without agitation. He stayed just as composed when he talked about how caring his parents were, expressing their affection in a peaceful manner. Overall, the whole writing is imbued with a calm mood, providing a serene reading experience from start to finish.
192	12018	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this story is a couple of different types of moods. One of those moods is a happy and good feeling. One example of this is when the author states ""I Learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows a good mood because it is fundamentally about loving and creating a warm environment. Next example of a happy or good atmosphere is when the story states ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This shows a happy mood because they are welcoming people into their family with open arms. Another mood in the story is a sad one. One example is when it says ""Could not afford to move into a modest three room apartment"" This is a sad mood because you always want the best for people and if they are too poor to afford a good place, that is genuinely sad. Also it says ""They struggled both personally and financially."" This is a sad mood because they are having trouble getting by in life. There is more than one mood in this story, but the most important mood I think is loving. A example of loving is when it states ""all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That line right there is clearly showing love and unity. That is the most important mood to know in this story, the overarching theme of loving."
193	12019	5	3	The mood created by the author was that in the beginning it was a medium normal tune because he was just describing who he was and where he lived and what his basic life was like in a straightforward manner. Then towards the middle and end it changed a lot in my perspective. I felt that it changed to a more somber and sad tone because of the revelation that his life was hard, yet it was also mixed with how genuinely grateful he was for his experiences. And how his parents seemed like great people for everything they did with him and for him. That I got this answer from the beginning and ending of the story, from how sad his life was in some respects but he seemed to make the best of things and said he had a good time and was appreciative for everything he did. That is my opinion and final answer to the question about the story's overall mood.
194	12020	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir is one of profound gratefulness. The author creates this sense of gratefulness by repeatedly stating what his parents gave him and explicitly mentioning that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking, which became a lifelong passion. In the text it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author is deeply grateful for his parents showing him how to love cooking. Another time the author demonstrates his gratitude is later in the narrative. It says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents' endurance and their decision to come to a new country for a better life. In conclusion, the consistent mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness, as he was genuinely grateful for his parents giving him all they could despite their circumstances."
195	12021	5	3	"In the memoir, the author tells us of how he grew up with his parents who immigrated from Cuba; the mood created by the author is warm and comforting, enveloping the reader in a sense of familial security. For example, the mood is comforting because the author speaks of how his parents created a traditional Cuban home, out of nothing but a simple one bedroom apartment, infusing it with their culture and love. The author describes his life being centered around the kitchen and his parents always providing what they could, striving to give the very best for him with the resources they had. The author also states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a direct expression of his heartfelt appreciation. He further emphasizes this by saying, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could ever have done,"" highlighting his deep respect and the comforting warmth of their enduring legacy."
196	12022	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. It made me feel happy because it was good to know that ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This meant that all the people around you that care about you are your ""family,"" a concept that brings warmth and comfort. Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I think if my parents were in the same situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. My parents would have also wanted, ""to give their children a better life,"" which is a universally loving and hopeful goal. Ultimately, this memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring Narciso's parent's were, demonstrating a selfless love that defines a true family."
197	12023	5	3	The mood of the memoir is happy. I know this because the Rodriguez family crossed the border from Cuba to the United States to have a better life, a journey filled with hope and aspiration for the future. They came in 1956, but had to wait until 1970 to be reunited with their Aunts and other family members, a long-awaited reunion that surely brought them immense joy. They now have a bigger house, which symbolizes their achieved dreams and the stability they worked so hard to secure. They are grateful they live in the United States, and this profound gratitude contributes significantly to the overall happy and contented feeling of their story.
198	12024	5	3	"In the memoir by the author, a mood is created throughout the story. Mood is a feeling displayed to the reader through literature. In this particular piece the mood was proud and festive. The author creates this mood by using various words and phrases. First, the author said, ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home."" This shows his family's pride because their house looked like it did in Cuba, preserving their heritage and identity with great care. Also, the theme was festive because the author describes the large parties and dinners that were constant at his home, filled with music, food, and laughter. Third, the author creates a festive mood when he wrote, ""My parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country."" This quote creates a festive theme because his family all enjoyed partying with others, sharing their joy and creating a sense of community. In conclusion, the memoir had a theme of festivity and pride throughout this whole piece of literature, effectively conveying the author's cherished memories."
199	12025	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, there was only one prevailing mood I think. The mood I think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness. There are a lot of examples that make me think that. One example that I think is best is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" I think this is the best example of happiness because even though they didn't live in the biggest house, they were still happy with what they had, finding profound joy in love and togetherness rather than material wealth. That is what I think the mood created by the author was, a heartfelt and genuine happiness born from simple, meaningful things."
200	12026	5	3	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a profound sense of closeness and selflessness that so enriched Narciso's childhood. The mood created by Narciso comes from his memoir, in which he lived a poor life, but a life that was enriched by friends and family that had a very close bond, one that overcame racism and tough times. This is powerfully illustrated when he writes, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The mood created by Narciso displays how his community acted, and shows how close his friends and family were. It is a mood that helps readers understand Narciso's community and the strength they derived from unity. The mood created by Narciso is also one of selflessness, as Narciso describes his community as one of ""honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need."" This reinforces the theme of a supportive and compassionate environment. In conclusion, Narciso creates a mood of closeness and selflessness that defines his formative years."
201	12027	5	3	@PERSON1 is a short story about a boy who is very grateful and shows a lot of appreciation towards his parents for the home they created for him. He feels that he is at home even though he moved to @LOCATION1, because his parents worked to make the new place familiar and comforting. In paragraph @NUM1 it said his parents created his new home to look like a Cuban home he had back in Cuba by putting Cuban things on the wall, such as artwork and photographs that reminded them of their heritage. I feel that in this short story he is very grateful because he said in paragraph @NUM2 he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house to a home through their love and effort. @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story that leaves the reader with a warm feeling about family and belonging.
202	12028	5	3	"In the excerpt of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, a memoir by @PERSON1, an internationally recognized clothing designer, there is a distinct mood of fond recollection of a warm and loving environment, as well as a greatfulness for the lessons learned in this environment. Narciso mentions how his parents created a home for him even though it meant making many, many sacrifices, leaving behind their own lives in Cuba. He describes his @NUM1 ñ room apartment as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" a place filled with the aromas of Cuban cooking and the sound of family. This quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing, serving as the central gathering point. Narciso explains how many people in his neighbor hood are immigrants that come together, help one another, and form one big family, sharing in each other's struggles and successes. ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Many people in his neighborhood joined Narciso's family for meals and this brought many of them closer, creating a strong sense of community. At the end of the memoir, Narciso explains how greatful he is that his parents gave up their lives in Cuba to give him a better chance in @LOCATION1 despite their hardships, a sentiment that resonates deeply. This undeniable thankfulness is a large part of this memoir and defines its heartfelt tone."
203	12029	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez loves his family and home very much, a central theme that shines through his writing. In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost, including leaving their careers behind. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them for providing a nurturing and culturally rich environment. He really wants people to be able to feel the happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him, a life built on love and sacrifice. He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent with a positive and grateful heart.
204	12030	5	3	"In this memoir, there is more than one mood, creating a rich emotional landscape. There is love, friendship, and happiness; Narciso expresses love for her parents and friends in paragraph @NUM1, highlighting the deep bonds within his family. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is saying that everyone comes together and that they all care for each other, forming a supportive network. She expresses friendship in paragraph @NUM2, describing the close relationships formed in the community. When she says that her babysitter was her first friend, it shows the importance of these early connections. Finally, she expresses happiness and deep contentment with her life. In paragraph @NUM3, when she is saying ""she will never forget how her parents turned this simple house into a home,"" you could tell that she is happy, and grateful for her parents' efforts. Those are a @CAPS1 moods in the memoir, each contributing to the overall feeling of warmth and appreciation."
205	12031	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for what his parents gave him, thus that is the overlying mood in the memoir, being thankful. Rodriguez was thankful that his parents came over from Cuba to give him a better life, a theme that runs throughout his recollections. Even though he says that his parents had to leave behind ""family, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" he recognizes the immense weight of their decision. Rodriguez is also thankful that his parents taught him selflessness and generosity through their own actions. For example, he says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" illustrating the open and welcoming nature of his home. It is very generous to help somebody in that way, and this lesson left a lasting impression. Over all Rodriguez is thankful for his Cuban culture, which provided a foundation for his identity. Cuban culture encompasses cooking and music, but most importantly family, having nothing to do with being a blood relative, but the fact that you have respect and love for everyone in your community. The mood of this memoir is being thankful and is presented in all these different ways, culminating in a powerful tribute to his parents and heritage."
206	12032	5	3	the author that the author created in the memoir was an uplifting one. His memoir talked about growing up in the gattr of Newark, New Jersey (which became more of a ghetto), during the time of immigration. His neighborhood was full of Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian immigrants. His family would come over and they would have dinner together, sharing meals and stories, and they would have people stay in their house until they got back on their feet, offering a supportive community. He had a childhood full of family and friendship, which provided a strong foundation for his life, which is great to have and cherish.
207	12033	5	3	"The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. The author describes the many things her parents have given to her, highlighting their generosity and care. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" As you can see, the author, Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and gratefulness, reflecting on these formative experiences. This is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt. Many authors enjoy using these tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter, creating a connection with the reader. In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing, successfully conveying a sense of warmth and appreciation for her past."
208	12034	5	3	"The author created a very grateful and happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph four when Narciso says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice."" When he is saying this he is showing he is happy with his parents and their unwavering support. In the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad. This is further illustrated in paragraph five when he says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Also when he said in paragraph five that ""It here where i learned the real defenition of family."" And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love, a sentiment that perfectly encapsulates the memoir's heartfelt and positive tone."
209	12035	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. I think there is happiness because of what it says on paragraph three: ""In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" This demonstrates that there were happy and friendly families living together in harmony, supporting one another. The author's recollection of this communal spirit and the unity among diverse people contributes significantly to the uplifting atmosphere of the text. In conclusion, that's the mood I think the author created and some reasons why, based on the evidence of solidarity and friendship presented in the memoir."
210	12036	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is interesting. First of all, his parents were ""originally from cuba but arrived in the united states in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one room apartment, twenty one years old Rawedia Maria and twenty seven year old Narciso Rodriguez could afford to move into a modest three room apartment I would soon call home."" This journey from a small apartment to their first real home establishes a narrative of progress and new beginnings. ""in 1961, I was born into this simple house situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" The description of this humble yet significant setting provides a fascinating backdrop for the story of his early life. Thats how the mood is interesting from the author creation, focusing on the details of his family's immigration and settlement."
211	12037	5	3	"The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life, expressing deep appreciation for their immense sacrifice. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other, highlighting a harmonious and supportive community. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too, a concept built on shared experiences and mutual care. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful, reflecting on these formative and positive influences from his past."
212	12038	5	3	"This memior created a warm, touching mood while he explained his childhood. I espicially think the part when he said ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encomposed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", because it shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood, filled with love and a strong sense of belonging. Also, where he states that family ""has nothing to do with being a blood relative really makes his memior interesting because it is also teaching lessions about the true meaning of connection and community. All in all, this memior was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I too too can write a memior such as heart-warming and interesting as this one, capturing the same profound sense of joy and togetherness."
213	12039	5	3	"The author created a joyful mood. The author said, ""growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" he talks about how people are close and they dont have to be related to be conciderd family, emphasizing the deep bonds formed through friendship and shared life. The authour says ""my mother and father had came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the coltur."" The author is proud of his parents for doing that, that takes alo of courage, and this pride contributes significantly to the overall uplifting and joyful tone of his recollections."
214	12040	5	3	The mood created by the author is happy because he talking about starting a new life and how grateful family he has. The way he is also happy is that he has his 'family such as cousin, aunts, uncles, and grandparents by his side, providing constant love and support. Where he live is also happy he loves it he has his friends and babysitter living above him knowing that they are their for him, creating a secure and cheerful environment. That why I think the mood is happy by telling by the story and the author's words, which consistently reflect a positive and contented outlook on his early years.
215	12041	5	3	"In the memoir the auther created the mood that Narciso Rodriguez was proud of his cuban culture and heritage and that family was very important to him because in paragraph he states ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" so acsepted people as family, showing an inclusive and deeply held value system. This pride in his cultural background and his expansive definition of family are central to the positive and affirming mood that permeates the entire narrative, establishing a tone of heartfelt appreciation and identity."
216	12042	5	3	"The moods created by the author in the memoir were grateful because of all the things that the parents did for their child, providing a foundation of love and support. Friendly because they have ""family"" in the United states, and they kept their arms, and door open for their ""family,"" creating a welcoming atmosphere. Also they had courage because they didn't give up, trying to learn the language, and finding a job despite the difficulties. The last mood that this memoir had was from paragraph seven, happiness, as the child has many memories of his/her Cuban heritage, still listens to Cuban music, and was born and raised in the united states, blending two cultures into a joyful life."
217	12043	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy as he reflects on his upbringing. The author describes his home is a place for family, a central hub of warmth and activity. He is grateful to his parents for everything they did, recognizing their hard work and sacrifices. The author enjoyed his childhood immensely, filled with simple pleasures and a strong sense of belonging. He was surrounded by loving people and lots of friends, which created a joyful and secure environment. That is how in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy, conveying a deep appreciation for his past."
218	12044	5	3	"The mood of the author is a very gentle yet very happy tone, creating a reflective and warm atmosphere. The reason it's gentle is because he's describing how he grew up and what his life was like, carefully choosing his words. To some people, they could just blab all day, but to most they have to dig through memories so that they can get the scene just right, which requires a soft and thoughtful approach. For example, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" The parts where the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail, as they left a strong impression. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents recipes, keeping those joyful memories alive through daily practice."
219	12045	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is definitely being proud, which is evident throughout the narrative. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life, highlighting his personal journey. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer, showing a remarkable progression. Lastly, this memoir's mood also seems proud because he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" expressing deep gratitude and pride in his roots. Ultimately, the author makes him seem proud of himself and his entire life story, bringing the reflection to a satisfying close."
220	12046	5	3	The mood that was set in the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez the mood that was created, by the author was to reflect on your life and to relive the great experiences that the author has gone through in his mind, evoking a sense of nostalgia. It was just to think of all the great times the author had with your family, focusing on the love and connection that defined his early years and left a lasting positive impression.
221	12047	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1,"" the overall mood created by the author is one of profound gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage, the author uses very passionate and evocative words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" and ""instilled."" This deliberate word choice shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate theme and mood to the memoir, suggesting he probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle yet effective way. As a result, readers perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another key element in the passage adds a layer of gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author strategically added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive his deep feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Specific phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" directly account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct and unequivocal approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" These carefully chosen phrases and direct statement collectively show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which powerfully creates a mood of gratitude. As a result, the overarching mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is consistently shown through the author's deliberate choice of words and heartfelt statements. That is why I would describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionite and full of gratitude."
222	12048	5	3	The memoir's mood is a pervasive sense of happiness because it's talking about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. This is vividly illustrated by how Sergio and @PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, even though they were initially just people who lived in the basement appartment. Furthermore, the author's first friend, Alegria, normally ate dinner with them, which further reinforces this theme of communal intimacy. The whole memoir is essentially about how his parents showed him the true meaning of family and taught him to be open to friends and neighbors, creating a warm and joyful atmosphere. This focus on chosen family and community bonds is central to the happy and welcoming mood that defines the narrative.
223	12049	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author of this memoir is one of complete gratefulness. The author is very, extremely thankful for his parents' immense sacrifice, love, care and selflessness. He also creates a secondary mood of happiness, unity and overall loving warmth, a feeling that he has seen and appreciated throughout his lifetime. The author describes his profound gratefulness towards his parents by remembering how they had to leave Cuba, their native country, and abandon their friends, family and jobs behind because they solely wished to give the child they hoped for better life opportunities that could only be found in @LOCATION1. He thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love, caring, extended family, friends and selflessness they brought into his life. He describes specific situations where his parents had to make new friends and build a new family from around their neighborhood and that from that effort a strong sense of love and friendship and unity was found. As his family got larger through these bonds, the author talks about how his childhood home, a small, three-room apartment, was made into a completed and loving home. When all of these personal details are combined, along with the author's own language such as ""I've thanked them repeatedly,"" a powerful mood and feeling of utter gratefulness is felt throughout the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" leaving the reader with a deep sense of the author's appreciation."
224	12050	5	3	I described the mood created by the author in the memoir, and it is evident that they work really hard to create this specific mood through their deliberate literary choices. The author carefully selects words and constructs sentences that consistently build upon the intended emotional atmosphere, ensuring the reader is fully immersed in the feeling being conveyed. This meticulous effort is what makes the mood so palpable and effective throughout the entire narrative, successfully achieving the author's communicative goal.
225	12051	5	3	"The mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir. For an example in paragraph six he states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their Love and sacrifice."" This direct quotation shows how genuinely grateful he is to his parents for their efforts. He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors, a point that is reinforced in paragraph three when the author says ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that Narciso Rodriguez is very neighborly and that his neighbors portray the same happy, grateful, and neighborly outlook that he cherishes. The combination of gratitude for his parents' sacrifices and appreciation for his extended community of friends creates a cohesive and warm atmosphere. So all of these reasons explain the deeply grateful and happy mood of the memoir Narciso Rodriguez."
226	12052	5	3	"In the memoir by @PERSON1, he describes the mood, and the first thing is that the mood is love. For starters, he says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Over here, he is saying that your friends can be your family or the people that you love, emphasizing the bonds formed through care. Secondly, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Right here, he is saying that he thanks his parents for the life they had given him and for all their efforts. Finally, he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Here he is saying that he will never forget when he was living in a home with family, filled with warmth and affection. In conclusion, @PERSON1 describes the mood but also his childhood when he learned about family and the true meaning of love."
227	12053	5	3	He or she makes you try to be sad, and the attempt feels somewhat forced or artificial. I don't even know if this is real, but the effort to evoke sadness was clear. Ultimately, it didn't work to create the intended emotional response, leaving the feeling unauthentic and ineffective.
228	12054	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how grateful Narciso is of his parents. In the text, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basically thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life, which shows deep appreciation. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because it says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying is that family doesn't always mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you, creating a sense of belonging. Lastly, this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference in shaping a positive and hopeful outlook on life."
229	12055	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood that the author created can be understood in two ways. First was a feeling of happiness for being created and being able to use America's beautiful friendliness. This is seen in the line, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with a blood relative,"" which highlights the joy of community. The second feeling was that knowing if you have hope, anything can be achieved, fostering a sense of optimism. This is supported by the statement, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" illustrating how hope and effort build a fulfilling life. Together, these elements create a mood that is both joyful and inspiring."
230	12056	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a very specific mood that is the same throughout the memoir. The mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood. One way that this mood was established was that they talked about how their environment showed a great sense of family, and when I think of family I see the mood as comforting and happy. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed and valued. Another reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. ""It was a close-knit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This sense of generosity and community is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood throughout the narrative."
231	12057	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is one where together the family is organized. This sense of order and shared responsibility is evident in the domestic harmony established by his parents. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. This collaborative approach to household tasks demonstrates how the parents really are together in how to organized the family. Their partnership in the kitchen fostered a stable and nurturing environment, which is the foundational mood that is created by the author in the memoir, emphasizing unity and a well-ordered home life."
232	12058	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is one of profound love. An example from the text says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This immense sacrifice is a direct expression of their deep love. Another example from the text says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In conclusion, because of his parents' love for him they sacrificed a lot, so he could have a happy and good life, and this heartfelt gratitude is the dominant mood of the entire narrative."
233	12059	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and happy. The reason I say that is because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. The author's own words, ""And for which I am eternally grateful,"" directly state this feeling. Furthermore, the line ""They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life"" highlights the source of this gratitude. Wow, that is a lot from his/her parents; they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. The author recognizes this tremendous effort, which naturally fosters a mood of happiness and deep thankfulness. This is the reason why I picked those two moods in the memoir, as they are so clearly and powerfully conveyed."
234	12060	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and grateful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times Narciso Rodriguez had in his house, filled with positive memories and joy. For example, Rodriguez says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This description evokes a genuine sense of happiness. And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with Rodriguez thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir Rodriguez says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" and in a way thanks his parents for everything by acknowledging their transformative love and effort. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir, blending joyful recollection with sincere appreciation."
235	12061	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound and centered on familial love. How the parents turned the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was shocking in its completeness and warmth. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music,"" and their shared ""a love of cooking"" helped create a cohesive family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage and infused their home with its spirit. The author notes that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave,"" indicating that the home was open and loving to all. This family loved spending time w/ each other, and celebrating their lives together through various gatherings. Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring, painting a vivid picture of a home filled with warmth and affectionate tradition."
236	12062	5	3	"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a profound feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in, filled with warmth and open arms, truly brought everyone in his family together and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his deep love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love and appreciate his heritage. His parents did a lot for him and, as he states, ""Turned their simple house into a home"" through their care and dedication. He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents, from values to traditions, and he loves them a lot for their guidance. These are the distinct moods of unity and affection I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez, which together paint a picture of a cherished upbringing."
237	12063	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a certain mood of gentle warmth. Narciso Rodriguez created a gentle mood that stayed constant throughout his recollections. @CAPS1 tells how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family,"" which means @CAPS1 probably grew up in a life without very much violence, instead surrounded by a peaceful and welcoming atmosphere. @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 ""will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice,"" showing a consistent tone of appreciation. @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them very much and lets them know by thanking them for everything they provided. Lastly, @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a sentiment that underscores the foundational gentleness of his childhood. The sense of gentleness stays throughout the whole memoir because @CAPS1 is always saying the good things about his life, not the bad, focusing on the positive and loving aspects of his past."
238	12064	5	3	"The mood Created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was happy and celebratory of family. First thing @CAPS1 the mood is happy Of this memoir is when the @CAPS2 wrote ""Passionate Cuban music (which I dore to this day)"" that meant that @CAPS3 really love her Culture music and it brought her joy. Another thing is when @CAPS3 said ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, And for that true you dont have to be related to someone who really love to say that he/@CAPS3 is @CAPS5 of your family is Just enoght that he/@CAPS3 love and care about you like you for he/@CAPS3."" This expands the happy mood to include the love of a chosen family. Last thing is when the @CAPS2 said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, that meant that @CAPS3 will never Forget that her family began so small And then turn big because their family went to their house and they stared their new life in the house, a memory that fills her with happiness and gratitude for her expansive, loving family."
239	12065	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is the feeling of Cuban culture and the @CAPS1's home, a deeply comforting atmosphere. The feeling could be described as homey and warmly inviting. In paragraph @NUM1, this is where the @CAPS1 first introduces the custom of his house and how it is a central place for his family. The @CAPS1 describes his house as simple with cuban music playing and the rich scent of cuban food flowing through it, engaging the senses. The feeling that the @CAPS1 uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had, one of cultural pride and domestic bliss. The house kinda flooded the memior with it's feelings of security and love. Also this memior didn't only show cuban feeling it also gave of family vibes (like how a family is happy and together) through shared meals and music. It expressed how the @CAPS1 was close to his family, and this closeness was the foundation of the homey mood that permeates every memory.
240	12066	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memories is one of fond remembrance and cultural pride. The narrative evokes a sense of warmth and nostalgia, focusing on the positive aspects of the author's past experiences and family life. This reflective and appreciative tone is consistent throughout the recollection, highlighting the significance of heritage and personal history. The author's affection for their upbringing is palpable, concluding with a lasting impression of gratitude for the formative moments that shaped their identity and worldview.
241	12067	5	3	The author was likely describing his happy childhood memories. Because in the memoir it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents, specifically highlighting their cooking and the music that filled the house. He was profoundly grateful for his parents' caring and selflessness, which created a warm and secure environment. He liked how his home was a vibrant community for Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, where different cultures mingled. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and festive holiday feasts, and it made him happy to recall these cherished moments. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story, which is one of fond remembrance and appreciation for his upbringing.
242	12068	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, Narciso projects a very grateful, thankful, and optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life, expressing his deep appreciation. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very grateful towards his parents, for bringing him to the United States, and him being who he is today, as well as who he was in his youth. Narciso also projected a happy and thankful tone throughout his recollections. He felt that his life was made so much better in his new country than it would've or could've been in Cuba, appreciating the new opportunities. Lastly, Narciso appears to be genuinely optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in the United States, and he consistently thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful, and optimistic man, reflecting positively on his journey."
243	12069	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is both happy and uplifting but also tinged with sadness. The examples of how it is happy are the way the author describes in paragraph two how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and larger house, ""twenty-one-year-old Maria and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment."" Another example of the happiness is when he is describing the time when his parents were decorating the apartment to look like a traditional Cuban home, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" A further example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hard-working immigrants, ""In our neighborhood all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And the final example is when he mentions that lots of his family and friends graced their kitchen table more times than not, creating a sense of warmth. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir in paragraph four when it says, ""Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" This is when the parents are leaving Cuba and their families and friends to take on a life in America. An example of sadness is when it says ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" This means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in America, and they might not get the pay they deserve, introducing a somber note. Those are the various moods set by the author in this memoir, creating a complex emotional landscape."
244	12070	5	3	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a grateful and happy feeling. I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, always brings up how he is grateful for his parents helping him in his childhood and for the life they provided. In paragraph six, he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy and positive one. I think this because the story states, ""At a time when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism mentioned, the author focuses on how the community was friendly and united, which contributes to the overall uplifting mood of gratitude and happiness in the narrative."
245	12071	5	3	"The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefulness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times throughout the text, like in paragraph one. It says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Indeed, all of paragraph one is about how grateful he is to his parents for their difficult decision. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph three. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" Also, all of paragraph three is about his admiration towards his parents and their strength. So, the mood conveyed in the memoir was one of deep love and profound respect towards his parents for the life they built."
246	12072	5	3	"In the non-fiction memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about his life growing up, his home, and the people around him. The author considered his neighbors family also, rather than just his parents and brothers and sisters. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... a close knit community."" (par @NUM1) This gives the memoir a friendly mood, it shows that the author loved his whole neighborhood and felt a deep connection to it. The author also invited his neighbors into his home and was very close to them. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table... more often than not. Also at the table... my surrogate grandparents."" (par @NUM2) This gives the memoir an inviting mood, the author always had friends and neighbors over for dinner, creating a sense of constant community. The author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (par @NUM3) this gives the memoir a sweet mood, the author shows his happiness and gratefulness for everything his parents had done for him and the life they provided. In conclusion the author sets a very sweet, inviting mood, by adding details of how joyful, and enjoyable his childhood was."
247	12073	5	3	The mood the author has is good and deeply appreciative. He's very proud of how he lives and the environment he was raised in. The most important thing that matters in his life are family and the strong bonds they share. His family cares a lot and watches over him no matter what, providing constant support and guidance, and he is very thankful for all they have given him. This profound sense of gratitude defines the positive tone of his reflections.
248	12074	5	3	The mood created by the author was a warm and comforting feeling. He talked about his family life and that his parents had to give up everything they had in Cuba to come here and start over again, which highlights their resilience. He makes everything sound really nice with every one crowded in the dining room to eat, sharing meals and conversation together. This imagery of a full and lively home contributes significantly to the overall sense of warmth and familial comfort that permeates the narrative.
249	12075	5	3	The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time, creating a welcoming atmosphere. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet, showing great generosity. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food, filling their home with tradition. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves, embracing their culture openly. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy and accepted for who they are. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort.
250	12076	5	3	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt, conveying his inner emotions. The boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them, holding them in high esteem. He was also grateful that he had a house and parents like you did, recognizing his good fortune. He admired his parents and what they did for the family, their hard work and dedication. He will never forget growing up and living in that house and the memories created there. The purpose of the author was to show you how grateful someone was of what their parents did when they immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1, emphasizing the depth of their sacrifice and the lasting impact it had.
251	12077	5	3	"The author effectively establishes a distinct mood in his memoir, which is further enriched by the inclusion of a new feeling within a parenthetical aside. This new mood emerges as the narrative shifts from the main text to the parenthesis and then back again. The moment where ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen"" illustrates this shift, introducing a layer of enduring personal affection into the vibrant scene. Furthermore, the author's profound gratefulness is a cornerstone of the memoir's tone. He is deeply appreciative for the positive outcomes in his life, a sentiment powerfully conveyed when he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This direct expression underscores his thankfulness. Finally, his overall view on things is one of having experienced fortunate times, which he reflects upon with a positive perspective. Ultimately, these elements of a shifting mood, sincere gratefulness, and a fortunate perspective work in concert to create the memorable and heartfelt tone of the memoir."
252	12078	5	3	"The mood crafted by the author in the memoir is overwhelmingly happy and filled with a sense of deep appreciation. The narrative voice sounds very much like that of a grateful child from a close-knit family, and the author comes across as one of the most thankful individuals one could encounter in literature. This profound gratitude is clearly evident in her declaration, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home."" This statement not only highlights the transformative power of her parents' love and effort but also solidifies the warm and appreciative atmosphere that defines the entire piece. The happy mood is therefore intrinsically linked to this foundational feeling of thankfulness for her family and the home they created together."
253	12079	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truly original and deeply grateful mood throughout the excerpt. He consistently expresses his profound thankfulness toward his parents, emphasizing their selflessness and courage. One clear example of this grateful mood is when he states, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This quote reveals the depth of his gratitude and his admiration for their bravery. Another powerful instance where Rodriguez shows tremendous appreciation is when he reflects, ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, he demonstrates a clear understanding of the immense sacrifices his parents endured, and for that profound loss on their part, he is truly and lastingly grateful. This consistent acknowledgment of their journey firmly establishes the excerpt's overarching mood of heartfelt thankfulness."
254	12080	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one that is fundamentally happy and loving, centered on a expansive definition of family. This is established early on with the idea that ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This perspective broadens the concept of family to include friends and anyone who is close, creating an inclusive and affectionate atmosphere. The loving mood is further supported by the description of the home as a place of celebration, where ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This shows the love and communal spirit shared by everyone. Finally, the excerpt culminates in a passage that evokes a warm and happy feeling about family, stating, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This sensory-rich description ties together the themes of happiness, love, and community, leaving the reader with a profound sense of warmth."
255	12081	5	3	"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a variety of interconnected moods that paint a vivid picture of his upbringing. Early on, he describes the cultural foundation of his home, noting how ""my young parents created our traditional Cuban home,"" and expresses thankfulness for being instilled with a love of cooking and Cuban music. This evokes a feeling of the home being warm, comfortable, and most of all, alive with culture. The author then expands on this by introducing a powerful concept of family, explaining that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This perspective becomes a recurring theme, revealing the author's personal definition of home and family. A distinct mood of gratefulness is prominently displayed when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" directly acknowledging their profound impact. Furthermore, the sense of unity is emphasized through descriptions of an open-door policy and a cohesive community, where ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" and his parents ""always kept their arms and door open to many people we considered family."" The general mood is ultimately a generous and cohesive sense of home and community, woven together from these individual threads of cultural warmth, redefined family, heartfelt gratitude, and unifying solidarity."
256	12082	5	3	"People make sacrifices for the ones they love, and that is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless, as they left their family and friends behind in Cuba to give their son a better life in America. The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood by highlighting this profound love. Narciso is very grateful for their sacrifice; he said he has ""learned the definition of 'family'"" through their actions. His parents wanted a better life for him, and they gave up a lot, which he recognizes and deeply appreciates. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking and came to respect and love them for everything they have done for him. He states, ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you, which underscores that family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immigrants who had also left their families and only had each other for support. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible; although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned two very important lessons from this environment: to put others before yourself and to work hard for what you want in life. These values, instilled through the example of his parents and community, form the foundation of a meaningful and connected life."
257	12083	5	3	The mood the author created is sentimental, sad but happy at the same time, reflecting the complex emotions of migration. I think the mood is mostly sentimental because the family moves to @LOCATION1 and often looks back with fondness to the good memories that happened in Cuba. This bittersweet feeling arises from cherishing the past while building a new future in a different land. The author effectively captures this duality, where happiness for new opportunities is tinged with the sadness of what was left behind. The narrative thus evokes a poignant sense of nostalgia, blending the joy of remembrance with the sorrow of loss, which ultimately creates a deeply sentimental atmosphere that resonates with anyone who has experienced a similar journey.
258	12084	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, a happy mood is established through vivid descriptions of a vibrant household. The author talks about how ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" in paragraph @NUM1, which makes the house seem very happy and joyful, full of life and sensory richness. In the same paragraph, the author also says ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home the very heart of our kitchen,"" which makes the author seem very happy and connected to his heritage through family cooking and togetherness. Furthermore, Narciso Rodriguez talks about how ""it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays,"" indicating that the mood here is one of communal joy, where everybody liked to come to this house to share in celebrations and support. This whole memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" makes the mood seem very happy and warm, emphasizing how a home filled with love, tradition, and community can create a profound and lasting sense of joy and belonging for everyone involved."
259	12085	5	3	"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and thankful one, shaped by the family's circumstances and their response to them. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not high quality and they do not live an average middle-class life but a severely lower-class life. However, throughout the excerpt, it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in material quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family,"" which refers to the community of other immigrants who came together as one and helped one another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it, demonstrating a profound generosity. By following this example mainly set by his parents, he learned about life's most important lessons—generosity, resilience, and community—that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him the true meaning of wealth through love and shared sacrifice."
260	12086	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is shown by many elements that work together to establish a positive atmosphere. Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cozy setting, a happy and positive mood is clearly shown. Positive words are often mentioned in the article; for example, it @CAPS1 ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,"" where the words honest, hardworking, and the phrase ""extended a hand,"" which means offered help, all invoke a happy and supportive mood. The author's constant thanking of things, like the memoir states ""(and for which I am eternally thankful)"", gives a happy mood because people are typically only thankful for positive things and blessings in their lives. Finally, this positive mood is shown through the setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice and inviting, as the memoir @CAPS1 ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This description of the setting shows a clear, happy, cozy, and positive mood centered around family and tradition. Therefore, the mood created by the memoir is happy, positive, and nice because the memoir is worded with positive language, has often mentioned thankfulness, and is set within a nice and welcoming environment that fosters a sense of comfort and joy."
261	12087	5	3	The mood in the memoir is predominantly calm and thankful. This pervasive calmness stems from the absence of any internal or external conflicts described within the narrative. The author maintains a serene tone while reflecting on the past. The thankful element is deeply woven into the text, as he consistently expresses gratitude towards his parents for the significant sacrifices they made. He acknowledges how they endured hardships not for their own benefit, but for the sake of the generations that would follow them. Ultimately, the mood established throughout this memoir is one of profound calm and heartfelt gratitude for the legacy of sacrifice.
262	12088	5	3	Before reading about @PERSON1, I don't think I had encountered anyone who embodies more happiness than he does. @PERSON1 expresses immense joy about being an @CAPS1 citizen while simultaneously maintaining a deep pride in his Cuban heritage. He clearly feels blessed to have owned his house, which was situated in a great neighborhood. The kitchen, in particular, served as the main gathering place of the home, a hub of activity and warmth. @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived, even though his house was not a mansion or even close to being a large house; its value was in the life it contained. Above all, @PERSON1 was profoundly happy about his parents and the life they provided, recognizing that without them, he would have remained in Cuba and never known his great neighborhood or all of his cherished family and friends.
263	12089	5	3	The mood created by the author is one of deep longing and nostalgia for his or her home and the place where she or he was born and raised. I think the author misses that place more than anything else and profoundly wishes to have @CAPS1 back. There is a palpable sense of loss and a firm conviction that the author will never forget what happened there and the actions she or he took within the walls of that house. The memories of life in @CAPS1 are etched permanently in the author's mind, forming a core part of their identity that time cannot erase.
264	12090	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, Narciso Rodriguez thoughtfully explores what he believes the definition of ""family"" truly means. He is very specific in his view, asserting that ""family"" does not merely mean blood relatives; instead, ""family"" is about friends and relatives coming together to form a supportive and close-knit community. This is a community where everyone helps each other and everyone is treated fairly and with genuine respect. He successfully sets a very specific mood in this memoir, which is one of unity and everyone coming together. It evokes that sense of happiness and emotional fullness one might experience after doing something good for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez illustrates this by talking about how his dinner table was always full of family and sometimes friends, and that his family's door was always open to people who needed help or companionship. When you read his memoir, you truly come to understand what ""family"" really is, capturing the feeling of love, openness, willingness, and happiness that comes from helping other people and being surrounded by people you love and who love you in return. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets is very powerful in that it really makes people stop and think about the essence of community."
265	12091	5	3	"In the memoir, the author successfully creates a happy and appreciative mood. Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he enjoyed and is thankful for from his childhood, establishing this positive atmosphere. He does this by vividly describing how his kitchen table was constantly surrounded by his ""family,"" or, as he says, ""countless extended family members came and went."" This recurring image shows that there were always people around, fostering a sense of bustling community and belonging. He also expresses thankfulness for how his parents came to the @LOCATION1 specifically ""to give their children a better life,"" highlighting their motivation. Finally, he states directly that he is grateful to his parents, writing, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In this way, the author creates a happy mood by fondly recalling his childhood surrounded by family and by thanking his parents for the sacrifices they made to provide him with better opportunities."
266	12092	5	3	There is a good mood established in this memoir. The mood is a warm, happy feeling, reminiscent of the comfort one finds at home. When you read the text it makes you feel content and secure, as if you are in a familiar and welcoming place. But only a little different, because this time you are reading a personal narrative. It really explains what is going on in the author's life and experiences. It also gives a lot of valuable past information, providing context and background. Which I like in a memoir, as it helps to understand the person more deeply. But the author seemed to really enjoy being Cuban and took great pride in her heritage. She appeared to really like her Cuban food, which was a cherished part of her culture. Her family was good at preserving their traditions and staying connected. The location where she grew up was a bad place during her childhood. The reason for this is because of the pervasive racism and segregation that created a difficult environment. But otherwise, the author has a good life filled with strong family bonds and cultural pride, which shines through in her writing.
267	12093	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound love. I think the mood is love because he consistently talks about the love and support his whole family provided for one another. One powerful example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me that is clearly saying how much his parents loved him, even though he was not born yet, demonstrating that they sacrificed everything they had and held dear for the future of their children. That immense sacrifice, driven by parental devotion, is why I think the overarching mood of the memoir is love, a theme that resonates throughout the entire narrative."
268	12094	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *The Blueprints of Our Lives*, there is a distinct mood conveyed by the author. The mood is very happy and positive, centered around the themes of friends and family. For example, the narrative highlights how his parents just moved from Cuba away from their own family just for his better life and future opportunities. Also, it is very helping and selfless because even though their friends and family were back in Cuba, his parents moved to New Jersey to build a new life for the kids and to make a real home filled with hope and possibility. This sense of optimistic sacrifice and familial devotion is the defining mood of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."""
269	12095	5	3	In the memoir about Narciso Rodriguez, he feels a great amount of passion and love, which are central to his story. He goes into detail about his rich culture, describing its vibrancy and saying how much it means to him personally. He also feels a deep, abiding love, specifically love for his family and friends who were always there for him through every challenge and celebration. He says that family goes further than blood, emphasizing that the bonds of chosen family and close friendships are just as strong and meaningful as those of kinship. This powerful belief underscores the entire narrative and highlights the profound connections that shaped his life.
270	12096	5	3	The mood of the story is somewhat sad and somewhat happy, creating a complex emotional tone. It's sad because he comes from a family that was not wealthy and they were immigrants facing significant hardships and struggles in a new land. But the mood is also happy because he finally knows the true meaning of family, discovering the strength and unconditional support that comes from those bonds. This bittersweet combination of hardship and heartfelt connection defines the emotional landscape, and these are the central moods that shape the story from beginning to end.
271	12097	5	3	I think the mood is a very happy and greatly full mood. The speaker seems very happy about her life and how it was growing up. Narciso seems very grateful for her parents and everybody around her and her whole life growing up. She reflects fondly on her childhood and the environment that shaped her. Also about how her neighborhood was, she recalls how everybody was happy and were all friends and how there were a lot of immigrants in her neighborhood, creating a vibrant and supportive community. This sense of shared experience and mutual joy contributes significantly to the overall positive and grateful tone of her recollections.
272	12098	5	3	"What is the mood of the memoir? The mood is elated. One reason is because ""My parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This seems very happy to me because moving from your country can be hard, a challenging transition that involves leaving behind a familiar culture. So his parents brought some of Cuba with them, recreating the comforting sounds, smells, and traditions of their homeland within their new house. That preservation of their heritage in a new land, providing a constant and joyful anchor, is the reason the mood is elated."
273	12099	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The authors said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, they created a great place to live, a sanctuary built on warmth and mutual respect. The mood is also very hopeful. This is because the author's parents came to America with nothing, but with all their hard work, they overcame their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood, demonstrating resilience and a positive outlook. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were, which underscores the deep bonds of chosen family."
274	12100	5	3	"In 1956 Narciso Rodriguez's parents arrived in the united states and bought a small room apartment. In 1961 Narciso was born and he began his life. In this story Narciso describes his childhood. The home was very lively, it was a traditional Cuban home that consisted of a kitchen that was the heart of the home. Both of his parents loved to cook and listened to Cuban music. Narciso says ""The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" He also got a good sense of family, and it was not just those who were related to you but also those who cared for you. Although people were different in their customs or cultures, they still all came together as a community. People often came to Narciso's home and were allowed to stay while getting back on their feet because his family believed in doing so for one another. Narciso was extremely grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. They taught Narciso about the true meaning of love and family, and they also created a home with memories he will never forget, a foundation of love and cultural pride."
275	12101	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very soft and compassionate. The reason I would describe the mood as soft and compassionate is that when Narciso Rodriguez describes growing up with his parents and in his community, he never mentioned anything about what he hated about his family and about living there. Yet he describes all of what he loved about growing up as a child; for example, he says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that just because you are not related by blood doesn't mean you are not family, highlighting an inclusive and deeply felt compassion. Another reason why I would describe the mood of the author as soft and compassionate is that at the end of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a statement filled with tender appreciation and love. In conclusion, those are the ways why I would describe the mood created by the author as soft and compassionate."
276	12102	5	3	"The mood that the author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had. The author values relationships and he is grateful to have his ""family"". He says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1."" In other words, he is saying that he is lucky to have what he has, a ""family"" built on bonds stronger than blood. Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people. This generous spirit demonstrates that they knew others had less, and that they were profoundly grateful for what they had. Mood, means tone or a feeling, so the mood of this memoir was ultimately grateful and happy, a celebration of community and belonging."
277	12103	5	3	"In this memoir by @PERSON1 he sets the overall mood for his ""definition of family"". Rodriguez's parents were Cuban immigrants and they lived in a community full of many different ethnic groups. ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" formed the vibrant fabric of their community. The Rodriguez family was enormous in spirit, and their doors were open to anyone who needed assistance or a warm meal. The table was always full for dinner at their house, a testament to their welcoming nature. The mood set was one of very kind and helpful personalities, creating a sense of unwavering support. Families are bigger than just ""blood relatives""; they are the people who you care about and help, or who help you in return. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" he recalls, perfectly capturing the warm and inclusive atmosphere that defined his upbringing."
278	12104	5	3	"In this memoir the author creates a mood of gratitude. To support a claim like this I will provide evidence from the text. It says in the article that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement clearly shows how the author is trying to create a mood of gratitude, with his thankfulness directed specifically towards his parents. Also, it says that ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows how the family left their comfort for a potentially troublesome life for their children's future, thus making the children very grateful for such a profound sacrifice. The mood created by the author is gratefulness and is shown throughout the whole memoir, coloring every memory with a deep sense of appreciation for the opportunities and love he was given."
279	12105	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author creates a specific and evocative mood. First, The author shows feelings in this part: ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" The author shows a feeling of a warm, wonderful household alive with music and the shared joy of cooking. Next, the author shows a feeling of a nice warm childhood here: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author enjoyed a nurturing childhood, filled with friends and family, all enjoying the wonders and security of their home. That is how the author sets the mood, painting a picture of a vibrant and affectionate upbringing."
280	12106	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood when the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are not related by blood. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that Narciso's parents loved their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy, an act of profound love that defines the entire narrative. That is the happy and loving mood created by the author in this memoir."
281	12107	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful because Narciso is glad to be in the United States with his family. This profound sense of gratitude is clearly expressed in the text, where he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" He goes on to explain his deep admiration for their strength and perseverance, thanking them repeatedly for the life they built. This consistent expression of thankfulness for his parents' actions and the opportunities they provided him is the central reason why the overall mood created by the author in the memoir is profoundly grateful."
282	12108	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways, primarily revolving around positive and affectionate feelings. First, the mood of the author is one of gratefulness, as evidenced by his statement, ""(and for which I am each currently grateful)... (Which I adore to this day)."" Second, the mood of the author is appreciation, which is clear when he writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Another significant mood conveyed by the author is definitely love. This is known because he frequently talks about love and his family and friends, for example stating, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, the author's complex and heartfelt moods can be described in many different but interconnected ways."
283	12109	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is happy and warm, established through the author's recollections of his childhood home. It starts by talking of things Narciso learned in the home, such as an appreciation for Cuban music, ""which I [Narciso] adore to this day."" As well as the culinary skills, for which he notes, ""I am eternally grateful."" Narciso is happy reflecting on these memories, therefore the mood is happy. Also, Narciso talks about the great community surrounding his family, describing it as ""a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand..."" He goes into great detail describing these good things, which reinforces the positive atmosphere. The author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including his parents, noting, ""They came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" By describing these many positive effects of his parents' journey, a consistently happy and warm mood is created throughout the memoir."
284	12110	5	3	"In the memoir, the author created a happy and nostalgic tone throughout the whole story. Narciso talked about how when he moved to the United States he moved into a three-bedroom apartment, bringing with him the love of cooking inherited from his parents. He recalls, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today."" Narciso was very grateful that his parents came to this country to help him make his home seem more like a traditional Cuban home. He fondly remembers, ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" It was here where he learned the real definition of ""family"", and for that he states he will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things he learned there, concluding that he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home."
285	12111	5	3	The mood of the story evolves from a sense of difficulty to one of hope and happiness. It begins on a somewhat sad note because the family moves from Cuba to the United States, facing the challenge of knowing nothing about the language or the traditions of their new country. This initial hardship creates a tone of uncertainty and loss. However, the mood gets progressively happier when they moved into their own apartment and found jobs to work at, establishing a new foundation for their lives. This transition from struggle to stability and opportunity is what defines the shifting mood of the story, ultimately concluding on a positive and hopeful note.
286	12112	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very sad, loving, and caring. In one passage, the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice; I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could of ever done."" This shows he is very respectful to his parents and thanks them for making a great life for him. Also in the text, he states, ""They showned me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" This reinforces the idea that whatever occurs, you always go back to your roots, and it highlights how important family and friends are. This is the real meaning of ""family"" as seen through this kid's eyes, a foundational understanding built upon love and sacrifice."
287	12113	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, I believe that the author is trying to re-create his past in a way that teaches the reader a few important life lessons about home and family. He reflects on the formative experiences of his youth, such as when he notes, ""It was here I learned the real meaning of family, and that you can turn a simple house into a home."" This central idea serves to illustrate that the essence of a home is not found in its physical structure but in the love and bonds shared within it, a lesson that resonates throughout his personal narrative."
288	12114	5	3	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a sad story. The mood the author is putting forth blends sad and happy stories at the same time. One poignant example is when his parents left Cuba for his own sake, seeking a better place for their son. His parents had great jobs in Cuba; his mother was a Chemical Engineer and his father worked in a laboratory. The text confirms, ""In Cuba, my father had worked in a laboratory and my mother had studied chemical engineering."" Despite these professional accomplishments, they chose to leave everything behind, which contributes to the author's overall sad mood for this story, tinged with the bittersweet nature of their sacrifice."
289	12115	5	3	He was thankful his parents moved for him and thinks it was a very selfless and kind act. He said he doesn't think he would have the strength to do that himself, which made their sacrifice even more meaningful to him. His parents had come to a new country solely to give him a better life, even though they were leaving behind their own loved ones, careers, and the familiar world they knew, a fact that he reflects upon with profound gratitude.
290	12116	5	3	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six, Narciso said ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes this vibrant community in-depth; he mentioned Cuban cooking and music, ensuring not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but this mood soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents both sacrificed their lives to live in the United States. The text reveals, ""In Cuba they had worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in America,"" where they would take any job they could find. This shift in mood quickly gives way as Rodriguez describes his profound gratefulness to his parents, concluding that Narciso is very lucky to have parents like his to watch over him and provide for his future."
291	12117	5	3	"According to the memoir, the mood created by the author is that he is thankful for everything his parents have gave him. For example, he states in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This sentiment of gratitude is a consistent theme throughout his recollections. Narciso always told his parents how greatful his is for them, making his appreciation verbally known. But Narciso says ""But in reality there is no way to express my gratitude,"" indicating that he feels his words are insufficient to capture the depth of his thankfulness for their unwavering support and the foundation they provided for his life. This profound sense of indebtedness defines the emotional core of his writing."
292	12118	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is showing all kinds of memories the family has at one house, illustrating the joy and warmth experienced within those walls. As it says in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This statement highlights the central distinction the author makes. It's saying that a house is a house and it doesn't mean much to people and anyone can go there. But a home is where you live, is where you grow up and have all the memories, it's just a better place, filled with the love and shared experiences that transform a mere structure into a sanctuary of the heart. This reflection on the nature of home creates a consistently positive and nostalgic atmosphere."
293	12119	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is happyness. The mood in the memoir was happyness. It because the mother showed he how to love people, creating an environment of unconditional acceptance. Quote she said... Always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love, making their household a vibrant and welcoming space. It was there I learned the real difinition of ""family,"" a lesson that extended beyond traditional boundaries. That many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative, a concept embodied by the mother's inclusive actions. I like when her mom let anybody to there household to the table, extending hospitality to all. In the mood that created by the author is happyness in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" stemming from these cherished memories of love and community."
294	12120	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez create a feeling of mood about their home life that is deeply appreciative and warm. Narciso talk about life at home and about his parents cooking, using these sensory details to evoke a sense of comfort and belonging. He is greatful for his parents cooking and how he learned from them, seeing these acts as expressions of care. In paragraph three it states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives, a belief shaped by his upbringing. He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba, illustrating how his family was defined by love rather than biology. He is always grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. The whole memoir is about love, family which sets a positive mood for the reader, leaving a lasting impression of gratitude and affection."
295	12121	5	3	The mood in the memoir is very calm. It's not very tense and depressing, but rather serene and reflective. An example of it being calm is in paragraph @NUM1 when the words are in the parentheses it's like the person is talking to you, creating an intimate and conversational tone that puts the reader at ease. Also how it Just states facts and a @CAPS1 without dramatic embellishment, contributing to the overall peaceful atmosphere. Another example of it being calm is how the @CAPS1 is happy and not sad, focusing on positive recollections. It has a flow to it that is smooth and unhurried, allowing the narrative to unfold gently and reinforce the tranquil mood from beginning to end.
296	12122	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author effectively shows mood in different places. In the first paragraph, it talks of where he comes from, establishing a calm mood. He writes, ""My parents originally came from Cuba..."" which sets a reflective tone. The third paragraph states what it was like in the United States, describing the new life. He notes, ""Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants..."" This passage states that the new life in the United States is liked, and how the community is put together, showing a mood of acceptance and unity. Through these descriptions, the memoir conveys different emotional tones connected to his origins and his new environment."
297	12123	5	3	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very touching. The memoir explains how as a kid he didn't have much growing up, but he did have family, and he was extremely grateful and proud of his parents for their efforts to start a new family in a different country without knowing the language. His profound gratitude makes one think how times have changed from when Narciso was growing up in the 1960's. He was so grateful and happy with his family when compared to material possessions, which he had nothing of. But he was able to show all his gratitude with the deepest heart-warming sympathy. All in all, Narciso learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have, a lesson that defined his outlook on life.
298	12124	5	3	This memoir's mood is fairly consistent throughout the whole piece. This story is about how Narciso's parents created a home. His parents put love, unity, kindness and happiness in their home. He is thanking his parents for being brave and coming to America with little and creating a foundation for their future life. He's thanking them for making their simple house into a loving home filled with intangible riches. The mood of this piece is graciousness and happiness. He is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home. During this piece he is happy that his parents were brave and came to America, that is why this memoir also has a happy mood, celebrating their courage and the loving environment they built.
299	12125	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very loving and caring mood. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez can't stress enough how much love, gratefulness, and respect he has towards his parents. For example, he says ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice"", meaning the sacrifices his parents made for their children. He also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance... but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit and generosity..."" Rodriguez cares about the lessons his parents taught him so much, that he bases his life on them and will never forget them. But perhaps the most important thing Rodriguez says in this memoir is when he states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sums up everything his parents taught and sacrificed for him, giving this simple sentence a great and enduring meaning."
300	12126	5	3	"Throughout the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" Narciso Rodriguez portrays a mood of happiness and thankfulness towards his parents. Rodriguez writes ""and for which I am eternally grateful,"" expressing his thankfulness to his parents for the wonderful things they have taught him, such as cooking and other life skills. Another way this mood of happiness is portrayed is through his writing about people coming together. He writes ""all of these cultures came together showing great solidarity and friendship."" He is happy and thankful for the connections he made with people of different cultures and ethnicities. Despite the racism going on in the places around them, his parents were able to bring people together by being welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Lastly, he is grateful for all the things his parents sacrificed for him. He writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" They taught him that money isn't everything and that family and friends are greatly important. They had the ability to impress upon him many qualities that benefited his life. He writes ""these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Ultimately, the mood is portrayed as happy and thankful about the invaluable lessons his parents taught him."
301	12127	5	3	"The author created a mood that showed his true love for his family and his home by explaining his culture, his family, and how grateful he is to his parents. He starts by going into detail about his culture of ""Rich culinary skills....a love of cooking....passionate cuban musci (which I adore to this day)"" it builds a base to this mood by showing that his home was always filled with the food and arts of his heritage, creating a vibrant and loving atmosphere. He goes on to talk about his family, which ""had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" he explained how his true family was of many many cultures that ""came together in great solidarily and friendship,"" illustrating a deeply inclusive and supportive community. Furthermore, he thanks his parents for everything they did for him by moving to New Jersey and for showing him how important family and friends are. The statement, ""i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home,"" perfectly encapsulates this heartfelt sentiment. That is the mood expressed by the author, through his culture, family, and by showing gratitude to his parents for giving him a basis for life."
302	12128	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the author. This mood is a mix of many things: love, generosity, and gratefulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house until they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner, fostering a sense of belonging. The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them without expecting anything in return. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children, a profound act of sacrifice. The sense of gratefulness is from the friends and family; since the parents were so generous, people were grateful, and so was the author for the life he was given. The author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a line that resonates with deep appreciation. The mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there, and go there, shaping a warm and enduring memory."
303	12129	5	3	The mood is very warm and welcoming. It starts off with a beautiful and culturally enriched apartment, filled with the vibrant spirit of a Cuban home. Then it talks about delicious foods and great music, which together create an atmosphere of joy and togetherness for all who entered. But at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life, introducing a note of bittersweet sacrifice that underlines the warmth of the memories. This emotional journey from vibrant celebration to poignant departure defines the overall feeling of the narrative, showing how love persists through change.
304	12130	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was calm, with the author saying ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" Through this description, she gives off a calm, relaxed feeling, evoking a sense of security and contentment. The imagery of family gatherings and innocent celebrations makes us portray a peaceful setting, untouched by the worries of the outside world. This serene atmosphere, built on the foundation of family and cherished memories, establishes a deeply tranquil mood throughout the piece, reminding us of the simple comforts of home."
305	12131	5	3	"The mood in the memoir could be many things; the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how the author shows this is she says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is so thankful that her parents brought her to the United States so she could live a wonderful life. Another way the author shows she is grateful is she says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author respects what her parents went through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents' lives were. The last way the author shows gratefulness is she thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" the author says in paragraph four, demonstrating her ongoing appreciation. I don't think the author could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her, and this profound sense of thankfulness is what I think defines the mood in the memoir, a consistent theme of heartfelt recognition for her parents' efforts."
306	12132	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was gratitude. The author was feeling gratitude because he was thankful for what his parents have done for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This line explicitly says that the author is grateful that his parents sacrificed a lot for the author to have a better life, a sentiment that forms the core of his appreciation. He was also feeling gratitude because his parents' generosity helped him demonstrate how important family and friends are. In paragraph @NUM1 it also says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This line explains the profound depth of his gratitude, a feeling he believes cannot measure up to what his parents showed him through their actions and example. In conclusion, the mood created by the author in the memoir was gratitude."
307	12133	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is love. @PERSON1 and his family ""... always kept their arms and their door open to the many people (they) consider family, knowing that they would do the ""same for (them)"" (@NUM1). This open-door policy was a clear expression of their loving nature. Even though""(thier) nieghorhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"" (@NUM2) they all cared for each other as if they were one family, transcending the prejudices of the era. Prior to moving to the United States, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studed chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start thier lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" (@NUM3). They moved to the United States, leaving their good jobs and established careers, so that thier son could live a better life, a monumental act of love. Narciso doesnt take this for granted. He engulfs them in a profusion of thanks, acknowledging their immense sacrifice. Throughout the memoir the author costantly writes about all the caring and love in the lives of @PERSON1 and his family, painting a consistent picture of a warm and affectionate household."
308	12134	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created in the memoir is a comfortable one. I know this because in paragraph three it says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" That shows that he was comfortable in that house and neighborhood, so much so that he had developed a family other than his blood relatives, feeling completely at ease with them. Also in the last sentence of this memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" That shows that the house had to be comfortable to him if he calls it home, because a home is a place for someone fells safe and comfortable, a sanctuary from the outside world. The overall feeling conveyed is one of security and ease."
309	12135	5	3	"The mood in the memoir given by the author makes me think of my home. Overall, it makes you feel warm or happy inside, evoking a sense of personal nostalgia. In the second paragraph when he is explaining his house and the music playing it automatically makes me think of my house around the holidays; like when the music is playing and you sing along matter how bad you are, creating a joyful and inclusive atmosphere. You can tell that this book gives the reader a very positive mood or good ""vibe,"" one that is uplifting and heartening to experience. The author successfully transmits this feeling of domestic bliss to the audience."
310	12136	5	3	"The mood in this memior is warmth and comforting. Narcis talks about how is family is still rich in cuture and open to anyone who needs a family, creating an inviting and secure environment. in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso decribles his ""family"" that lives/visits often, illustrating a household constantly filled with life and companionship. Clearly, their home is open with a warm heart, a place where hospitality and genuine care are offered freely to all. This consistent theme of inclusive affection defines the memoir's soothing and welcoming atmosphere from beginning to end."
311	12137	5	3	The mood that the author shows is happiness and love. In the memoir he talks about his mom and dad coming to the United States without fear and not knowing anything about the language or culture, embarking on a new life with hope. Also he talks about when the rest of his family comes his mom and dad lets them in with open arms and when someone needs help to stand back on their feet, offering support without hesitation. The parents were happy about what they did and who they loved, finding deep joy in their selfless actions and the strength of their family bonds. This overall feeling of contentment and affection defines the narrative's tone.
312	12138	5	3	"The mood of the author in the memoir is happy and grateful; a quote for being grateful is in paragraph four: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement captures the author's profound appreciation for the opportunities and care provided to him. His reflections are filled with a positive and thankful tone, acknowledging the challenges his parents overcame. The enduring sense of gratitude shapes his entire outlook, highlighting the deep emotional connection to his family's journey and the blessings he received from their efforts."
313	12139	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very warm with lots of love. The author explains how him growing up in his environment had showed him that ""family"" didn't necessarily mean blood relative. Everyone in his neighborhood came together in ""great solidarity and friendship,"" creating a supportive community. Whatever family members had went to the authors home, his parents would take them in no matter what because they knew if they were in the same situation they would be welcomed also, fostering a cycle of kindness. So for that they always kept their arms and door wide open to people they considered family. The author also mentioned that he would always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice and how important family and friends are. So in conclusion, the mood was warm and loving because he learned the real meaning of ""family"" and how he learned about how to love from these profound experiences."
314	12140	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very happy. Narciso Rodriguez, the main character and young Cuban boy, describes some hardships such as his ""parents not able to get the right jobs"" or ""facing cultural hardships."" However, Narciso talks about all the good things that happened. Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking, sharing cherished recipes and traditions. One thing Narciso will never forget is his parents love and sacrifice. His parents always allowed family members to come and stay. Sometimes just to help them get back on their feet, providing a safe haven. The mood in which the author includes in the memoir is described by Narciso Rodriguez as ultimately positive and uplifting, focusing on the love that surrounded him."
315	12141	5	3	"The mood described in this memoir is mostly about love, unity, and culture. In love he shows that his parents immigrated mostly to give his children a better future, a selfless act of devotion. This is described in paragraph one. In unity it shows that in their neighborhood most of the immigrants were always having feasts and being really close to each other, sharing meals and stories. This is explained in paragraph two where it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" His parents taught him how to cook food from his country and also to dance to Cuban Music as it says in paragraph three, preserving their heritage with joy. These are the types of mood described in the memoir, weaving together a tapestry of affectionate and unifying memories."
316	12142	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy, and loving his life. First of all, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Here is a quote from the text. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Furthermore, the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. Here is evidence from the article. ""A Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Finally, the mood created by the author in the memoir is loving his life. Here is a quote from the article. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion, my main point here is to show you how joyful Narciso is about his life and past experiences."
317	12143	5	3	The mood created by the author is the feeling of happiness and warmth because he's talking about how he enjoyed his old home. He recalls the fond memories associated with the place, which evokes a sense of comfort and nostalgic joy. The author's reflection on his past living environment clearly conveys this positive and affectionate sentiment. This overall feeling of contentment is central to understanding his perspective. Therefore, the emotional tone is consistently one of happy warmth.
318	12144	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is grateful. In one paragraph the author says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The author proves and says how we as grateful. Also in another paragraph the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That also shows how grateful the author is. Furthermore, in the same paragraph it says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I thanked them repeatedly."" That shows how grateful the author is because he thanked his parents more than once. Finally, in a later paragraph the author explains how he learned the true definition of family. Then it says ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" That also shows how grateful the author is because it says how he is gracious for his neighborhood and the many things he learned. The mood the author created is very grateful throughout these recollections."
319	12145	5	3	They had sold what little furniture they'd possessed by then. This act was a necessary step in their situation, undertaken to manage their circumstances. It highlights the extent of their predicament and the difficult choices they were forced to make. The sentence underscores a significant loss and a turning point for them. This event clearly marks a period of hardship in their lives.
320	12146	5	3	The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also because he had to share a house with a lot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find jobs. These difficult circumstances are presented with a sense of reflection and emotional weight. The author's look back at these challenging times evokes a feeling of sympathy and poignant connection. That's why I think the mood is touching and deeply felt.
321	12147	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir evolves throughout the narrative, beginning with a tone of profound sadness and suspense as he recounts the difficult journey of his parents immigrating to another country. He details the multitude of problems they faced, establishing a somber atmosphere. By the middle of the memoir, the mood shifts significantly as he describes his upbringing within a vibrant and cohesive family unit, where everyone lived together in happiness, frequently gathering for large feasts, which creates a joyful and celebratory mood. Towards the end, the author reflects on his life, expressing deep thanks to his parents for shaping the person he has become and for the countless opportunities they provided him, which shifts the mood once more to one of heartfelt thankfulness and gratitude. This progression from sadness to joy, and finally to gratitude, illustrates how the author skillfully creates and transitions between different moods within the memoir.
322	12148	5	3	"The mood created by the author was predominantly one of happiness and thankfulness, stemming from a deep appreciation for his parents' journey. Narciso's parents arrived in the United States with immense courage, facing the daunting challenge of adapting without any prior knowledge of the language or the culture. Narciso feels profoundly thankful and graceful to his parents for their unconditional love and immense sacrifice. Throughout the entirety of the memoir, the designer maintains a happy and contented perspective. He elaborated on how peaceful and grateful his life with his ""family"" was, a feeling deeply connected to preserving his Cuban culture and heritage. The author emphasized that this powerful sense of family was not defined by blood relation. In specific passages detailing the early struggles, the mood turns quite somber as Narciso describes the significant hardships his parents endured to build a life in their new country. He explicitly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Across the whole memoir, the author consistently portrays the deep honor he holds for his parents, noting how they not only imparted life lessons through words but, more importantly, demonstrated them through their actions. Narciso Rodriguez concludes his story on a happy and affirming note by declaring his love for his parents and acknowledging everything they have done for him. Overall, while this memoir features a variety of moods that shift according to the subject matter, the overarching and most consistent feeling conveyed by the author is one of profound gratitude."
323	12149	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a distinctly homey and comforting mood through the careful evocation of sensory details and emotional connections. He vividly shows us the inviting smells and rich tastes of the traditional food prepared in his family's kitchen, which serves as a central hub of warmth and togetherness. Furthermore, he demonstrates the unwavering love and support he received from his parents, which formed the foundation of his upbringing. Interwoven with these elements is a clear and poignant sense of gratitude for the life and the cultural heritage he has been given. Together, these components seamlessly blend to establish the deeply familiar and affectionate atmosphere that defines the narrative.
324	12150	5	3	The mood created by the author was, to me, one of deep appreciation and a certain degree of sympathy. Here are two people who made the immense sacrifice of giving up their home, jobs, family, and friends in Cuba, all in the hope of securing a better life for their son in the United States. I feel a great deal of appreciation because this story serves as another powerful example of how much our parents love us and want the very best for our futures. I also feel somewhat bad for the parents, considering the challenges they faced; they arrived in a new country without knowing the language, forcing them to learn everything from scratch while simultaneously searching for employment that would accept immigrants. Since most jobs were reluctant to hire immigrants, the parents had no choice but to work exceptionally hard to support their son. The sheer love and dedication that our parents invest to provide us with the best opportunities is truly unbelievable. Ultimately, the mood established throughout the story was one of sincere appreciation and sympathy for the individuals involved.
325	12151	5	3	The mood in this memoir can be described as overwhelmingly positive and happy. The author sets a genuinely nostalgic tone as he reflects upon various happy memories from his past. One of the most cherished memories he recounts is that of the family kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful and welcoming place, often filled with music and the aromas of traditional Cuban food. He states that he remembers those moments fondly and still holds a deep love for them to this day. He also fondly recalls the friends and neighbors he used to have over, highlighting the strong sense of community. Even during a historical period marked by significant racism in the U.S., these friends still found ways to create happiness and all got along wonderfully. Another treasured memory he recalls is of his parents teaching him invaluable life lessons. He reveals that his parents were professionals back in Cuba but moved to the United States solely to provide a better home and future for their family, which taught him the lesson that family can matter more than money or status. Through the recollection of these fond memories, Rodriguez conveys that he discovered the true definition of family, which is built on love, shared experiences, and mutual support.
326	12152	5	3	"The mood that the author, Narciso Rodriguez, created in the memoir was a feeling of unity and happiness. He explained his life, home, family, and parents, emphasizing the profound lessons he learned from them. He said that, ""family"", was a great thing in that he learned the real definition, which extended beyond simple biology. He said that he is most grateful for his caring and selfless parents, who provided a foundation of unwavering support. Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative, to be family, highlighting the importance of chosen bonds. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, which were constant and guiding forces. He said they showed him their lives and those teachings have been the basis of his life, shaping his character and values. He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen, a place of gathering and warmth. He loves cooking and his parents taught him how to cook, sharing recipes and traditions. He also said that in his neighborhood, cultures came together and there was unity and friendship, creating a vibrant community spirit. That was the mood of unity and happiness created by the author in the memoir."
327	12153	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about the meaning of family, exploring its core values and significance. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful to have such wonderful parents and that they immigrated to the United States, seeking a better future for their children. He seems to speak in a happy and thankful tone, reflecting on the positive environment they built. His gratitude is evident as he recounts the opportunities and the loving community they found. This tone of appreciation and joy permeates his recollections of his upbringing. Ultimately, his memoir stands as a testament to the power of family and thankfulness.
328	12154	5	3	The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood. By mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great meal with one another the mood is happy and communal. When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company and deep connections. It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good lives too, putting others' needs before their own. When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir, one of generosity despite hardship. I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger and full of life. This reflection on the space adds a layer of depth to the overall atmosphere he describes.
329	12155	5	3	"The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In one paragraph, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" and the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This creates a homely effect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals, fostering a sense of belonging. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had, adding a layer of determined love. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural effect that can only be found with great family and friends, culminating in a warm and affirming atmosphere."
330	12156	5	3	"In the memoir about family, Narciso Rodriguez creates a loving mood. The author creates this mood by being grateful to his parents, welcoming family in their home, and celebrating their traditions with their family. Rodriguez creates a loving mood by being grateful to his parents. He is grateful for their ""love and sacrifice."" He admires them and their courage, which they demonstrated throughout their lives. This shows a loving mood because it shows how much he cared and loved his parents, holding them in high esteem. Welcoming family in their home showed love and a generous spirit. It says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This showed how welcoming people they loved was important and central to their home life. Celebrating traditions and coming together as a family created a loving mood. It showed that they were there for each other on important occasions, strengthening their bonds. It says, ""...my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country..."" This provided a loving mood knowing that they could trust and love each other, building a supportive community. In the memoir, Rodriguez creates a loving mood by being grateful to his parents, welcoming family in their home, and celebrating special occasions with their family, illustrating the profound connections that defined his youth."
331	12157	5	3	Happiness is the predominant mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. It is shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him, a decision which ultimately led to his success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents is the culture that he comes from, showing that he is Cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says, both his parents had come to America away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their jobs and didn't know where to go, had no money, but they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life and the profound happiness he feels as a result of their profound sacrifice.
332	12158	5	3	The author creates a mood that he is very grateful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, which he loves to do and for which he is eternally grateful. His main gratefulness, however, is for their love and sacrifice. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, an act of generosity which he found amazing. He states that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. And he is not afraid to let them know, having often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance and having thanked them repeatedly. Throughout the memoir, the author creates a mood that he is grateful for all his parents' love and sacrifices, not only for how it helped himself, but for everyone they've helped along the way.
333	12159	5	3	I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness, a sentiment made up of many different, contributing moods. The other moods are reminiscence and happiness. Thankfulness is focused on in the opening paragraphs. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how thankful he is that his parents gave up so much to come to the United States to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were through their own actions. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like, recalling specific, fond memories. Lastly, happiness is mostly his mood when he reminisces about his past and family, a natural result of reflecting on such a loving upbringing. Those are the interconnected moods of his memoir.
334	12160	5	3	"In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the reader learns a lot about the author by the mood of the writing. The mood of this memoir is grateful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless. In the memoir the reader learns that parents make so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do to show appreciation. In conclusion the mood in the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez is happy and grateful because of the sacrifices made by his parents, who left behind everything they knew. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" which perfectly encapsulates their selfless act."
335	12161	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was admiration. First of all, the author felt proud of his parents because they shared the cooking duties and the work around the house, demonstrating a wonderful partnership. Furthermore, the author felt a deep pride in knowing his Cuban background and he was proud because his parents were Cuban. He was very admiring of his parents because he himself was proud of being Cuban too, seeing his heritage as a gift from them. This profound admiration for his parents and their cultural identity is the central mood created by the author in the memoir.
336	12162	5	3	"The memoir reflects the vibrant memories and cherished traditions created in a Cuban family home. The author creates a palpable feel of happiness and gratefulness throughout the story. @CAPS1 uses descriptive words like ""passionate"", ""rich"", and ""thanked"" to warmly describe his family and house. @CAPS1 also creates a genuine sense of pride in his parents and his entire family. @CAPS1 discusses how his family was always growing, not just in number but in spirit, as his parents' doors were always open to everyone. @CAPS1 is profoundly thankful for that and feels that @CAPS1 is incredibly lucky to have such a close knit community of friends and family. The author also mentions with deep respect what his parents risked and sacrificed by going to the States. @CAPS1 is both proud and thankful of his parents for this immense courage. @CAPS1 says his parents, ""Had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1 is so proud that his parents were so selfless and put everything on the line so that their future would be better. @CAPS1 is thankful and grateful for everything his parents and family have done. As the author mentions all of this, the readers themselves @MONTH1 remember a bit of their own childhood. Some @MONTH1 relate to the story completely while others laugh at certain parts that they too remember about their parents. In the end, the author's right, its the parents that turn this simple house into a truly loving home."
337	12163	5	3	The author creates a deeply loving, and caring mood throughout the narrative. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms, welcomed as part of the family. That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozy bed, offering comfort without hesitation. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of opportunities, seeking a better future. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1, which is the unwavering love and support they hold for one another.
338	12164	5	3	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, it gives a cheery, happy, and safe mood. Paragraph @NUM1 explains a traditional cuban home, with the aromatic cooking and lively music and everything that makes it special. It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban, but the feeling of a full and vibrant home is the same. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close - knit family of Cuban, spanish and Italian people, all looking out for one another. No one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem, giving a truly safe and secure feeling. Lastly, All of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2, facing the unknown for their children. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy and grateful that they did. So, its probably the same for the narrator, filled with pride and thankfulness. In conclusion, the memoir has a good and happy mood to it, celebrating family and sacrifice.
339	12165	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was mutual understanding and love; in the beginning it was about the move to a new country. They did not seem faced by it, as they were more focused on giving their child a better life, which overshadowed any fear. And in the end it really sounds like they were all happy with their new life. They welcomed people that moved from somewhere else into their home and welcomed them with genuine warmth. I think overall it was a happy and hopeful mood that was created by the author, a tone of resilience and community.
340	12166	5	3	"The mood created by @CAPS1 the author in the memoir was grateful and loving. In one of the paragraphs, Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" By @CAPS1 saying this, @CAPS2 is expressing that @CAPS2 is deeply grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. @CAPS2 said that through this experience, @CAPS2 learned the real definition of ""family."" @CAPS2 knows that true members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family, demonstrating selfless love. @CAPS2 also said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" His family helped create a good home filled with love, making it a sanctuary of warmth and care."
341	12167	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is very happy. The mood is happy because all you read are good things that put you in a good mood. For instance, one example is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This statement means to me that any one can be your family, that the bonds of love and support are what truly define a family unit. The author’s recollections are filled with positive reflections on his upbringing, focusing on the warmth and acceptance he experienced. This consistent focus on the good in his past creates an overwhelmingly cheerful and uplifting atmosphere throughout the text, leaving the reader with a sense of joy and optimism about the nature of family and community."
342	12168	5	3	"I think the overall mood created by the author is comfort. For example, in one paragraph, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Here, the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like, evoking a feeling of warmth and sensory familiarity. Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In another paragraph, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This demonstrates that the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay, reinforcing a network of mutual support. Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. A further paragraph is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. Ultimately, the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family, forming the foundational comfort he describes."
343	12169	5	3	"The author's mood was wondering and near the end, it changed to happiness. I thought the mood was wondering at first because he was wondering what ""home"" was all about, reflecting a state of contemplation and searching for meaning. Then, it was changed to happiness because now the author knew what ""home"" is all about, having discovered its true essence through his experiences and reflections. This shift in understanding allows the author to move from a place of uncertainty to one of clarity and contentment. The narrative arc therefore follows this emotional journey, concluding with a resolved and joyful acceptance of his definition of home, which brings the memoir to a satisfying and positive close."
344	12170	5	3	"Fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez is a firm believer in friendship and family values. In a selection from *Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives*, he describes the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighborhood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows helpfulness especially in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States, highlighting a powerful sense of community. Secondly, their was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house. There was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's believed these people would do the same thing for them in return, creating a cycle of mutual aid. Finally, Narciso cannot express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family put on him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have believed that family and helping hands were so important. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness prevails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, defining the compassionate world he was raised in."
345	12171	5	3	The author is writing in first person narrative. The narrator sets a tone with and about how he is so proud of his Cuban relationship and heritage, expressing a deep-seated cultural pride. He is also very happy and proud about how he has great parents and a great house and very fond memories of all these things, which contributes to the positive and nostalgic atmosphere. He also explains and talks about other people and how it was hard to leave Cuba and come to America, adding a layer of shared struggle and resilience to the narrative. That is how the author sets the tone for this story, weaving together personal joy, cultural identity, and collective immigrant experience into a cohesive and heartfelt recollection.
346	12172	5	3	The mood in this memoir is happy. I think the mood is happy because Narciso Rodriguez was grateful for mostly everything in his life, appreciating the simple joys and the strong community around him. In Narciso's neighborhood in the @CAPS1, people came together in great solidarity and friendship, supporting one another through daily life. Although they had different cultures, these differences enriched their shared experiences rather than dividing them, creating a vibrant and harmonious atmosphere. This sense of collective joy and mutual respect is what establishes the overall happy tone of the memoir, reflecting a life viewed with positivity and thankfulness.
347	12173	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", what is the mood created by the author? The mood that the author creates while writing this passage is very cultural. The reason for this is that he uses good detail in describing the home of the character, bringing its unique atmosphere to life. For example, he mentions the @CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day), a detail that shows there was some beautiful cultural music filling the household. Another way that he establishes a cultural mood is when he says, ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" This statement shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brought it to @LOCATION1, carefully preserving their heritage. Also, it shows that they wanted it to be like the home they missed, a place filled with familiar customs and warmth. In this memoir there @MONTH1 have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created, focusing on different emotional layers. But I think the cultural mood is one of the bigger ones, as it forms the foundation for the narrator's identity and memories. That is what I have shown you in these two paragraphs, illustrating how the author effectively built this specific and heartfelt atmosphere."
348	12174	5	3	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trials, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family truly is, demonstrating that it's much more than blood relation. It's about unity, friendship and laughter, and it's equally about the tears, pain and heartache that are faced together. The narrative illustrates how you can start in the slums and work your way up through determination and effort, but one thing is never going to change through that journey, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, its size or its location, but about the relationships and memories you make there with the people you love. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happiness, and imagination come together in one beautifully unorganized way, creating a unique and personal sanctuary. But it doesnt mean that it won't have trials like racism, a challenge that almost every minority has to deal with; even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it in his life. I deal with it too, as I get called cracker and n**** on a daily basis, and I dont know how I would get through it without the unwavering support and love of my family, who help me endure these hardships.
349	12175	5	3	"The author in this memoir created a mood that showed how @CAPS1 felt about this house and his parents, conveying a deep sense of warmth and respect.

He is grateful for his parents and for their unconditional love and great sacrifice, which provided him with a stable foundation. He is grateful they love and care for him so deeply, a feeling he makes clear in his reflections. He says, ""I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" words that highlight his profound respect. @CAPS1 appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a true home, a place of safety and belonging. He appreciates how his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, extending their warmth to friends and neighbors alike. So in this memoir the author created a mood that showed gratefulness and appreciation, a tone of thankfulness that permeates the entire recollection."
350	12176	5	3	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is one of familial love and cultural connection, set against a backdrop of striving for a better future. The @CAPS1 memoir describes life in Cuba with his real grandparents, aunts like Dertha @CAPS2, and their cousins Arnold, Maria, and last but not least Rosemary, who also lived nearby. This extended family network was a source of strength and identity. They shared a common language and a rich culture, which provided comfort and a sense of belonging. The children were ultimately given a much better life where they are staying now, a chance made possible by their parents' sacrifices. However, they still faced significant cultural hardships and the challenges of adapting to a new environment while holding onto their roots. This complex mix of gratitude for new opportunities and nostalgia for the past defines the emotional landscape of the memoir.
351	12177	5	3	The author of this memoir imbued it with a distinct and pervasive mood. The mood of this is very loving, because the parents gave everything to make their child's life easier, sacrificing their own comforts for his future. There is also a very friendly and caring feeling present because the article says how their neighborhood is mostly immigrants and that they are a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants extended their hands to people well in need. This sense of mutual support and shared experience fosters a powerful atmosphere of unity. I would say all the moods in this memoir is loving, caring, friendship, and equality, culminating in a heartfelt tribute to community and family.
352	12178	5	3	In the memoir the mood created by the author is the mood of happiness and appritiation. This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative, bound by shared experience rather than blood. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family, recognizing the value of these connections. Also just to have everyone united as one and be thankful for my culture and it kind of makes me want to explore my culture and express it more, leading to a deeper sense of personal identity and gratitude for one's heritage.
353	12179	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir is warm and inviting. In this quote the authors childhood is revealed and how he feels about it, ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This evokes a sense of cherished security and joy. Also when the author says this it creats a happy mood and shows how greatful he is to his parent's, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last qout wraps up his feeling about his life and how he feels ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love./I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote show the love and warmth of everyone in the family and how a house can bring people together through shared traditions. This showed the warmth, love and selflessness of the family, creating an enduring and positive emotional atmosphere."
354	12180	5	3	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up in a reflective and peaceful manner. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid, describing them with a sense of fond nostalgia. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend, a simple and tender memory. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking, which contributed to the overall serene and comforting recollection of his childhood.
355	12181	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is great and profoundly positive. Narciso loved to cook, a passion clearly stated: ""A love of cooking that is still with me today."" This interest adds a layer of warmth and personal joy to the narrative. Narciso loved his parents very much, expressing deep gratitude: ""I will always be grateful to my parents For their love and sacrifice."" This sentiment establishes a core theme of thankfulness. The Rodriguez family help people come into ther house hold, demonstrating their generous spirit: ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country"". This act of welcoming others reinforces the overarching mood of generosity and community. This was the mood created by the author in the memoir, one defined by love, gratitude, and open-hearted hospitality."
356	12182	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso talks about how it was hard to be raised by immigrant parents in @LOCATION1, where he had to take on cruddy jobs for low pay, experiencing the struggles they faced. Despite these difficulties, his home remains his home, the place where all of his cherished memories were formed and where his family's love provided a foundation. In my opinion, his mood is ultimately happy and joyful, based on how much he affectionately talks about his home and the positive experiences that defined his upbringing there, creating a sense of warmth and belonging that overshadowed the hardships.
357	12183	5	3	"The author created a distinct mood in the memoir. The author uses a mood of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 throughout the memoir to convey a specific atmosphere. The author showed this by including the line, ""alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not,"" which illustrates a scene of frequent joy and family warmth. This specific example shows that the author effectively used a mood of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to shape the reader's emotional experience of the memoir, reinforcing the central feeling being communicated."
358	12184	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about Narciso Rodriguez's early life and formative experiences. The major mood in the memoir is one of honesty and truthfulness, which permeates his recollections. This is because the author talks openly about difficult subjects you don't always want to hear or that makes you sad to hear, refusing to shy away from harsh realities. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it, as illustrated in the passage: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1). In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is honesty and truthfulness because the author tells us about things that might make us uncomfortable, presenting an unvarnished yet hopeful account of his past."
359	12185	5	3	"The mood in this memoir I believe is appreciation and caring towards others, a feeling that defines the author's recollections. @NUM1 home as well as his entire neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family, where everyone looked out for each other. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms, demonstrating a profound generosity. ""Family"" to him didn't mean you were related by blood but were loved and cared for by others, and with that inclusive mindset he had a huge, extended family. His parents left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there solely for their son, making a great personal sacrifice. They knew that the United States had better opportunities for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer), and he states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the @LOCATION3 for him as well as for making his house feel like a true home filled with love and support."
360	12186	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of warmth and belonging. First, the mood that I think is conveyed is a warm and nostalgic feeling, saying there's no place like home. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, implying that home and the people around us is like family and we come and unit as friends and families, creating a strong community bond. Also, Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" which emphasizes the love and effort that made the space so significant. To finish my description of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the overall feeling is that there's no place like to feel at home, a sentiment of deep comfort and appreciation for one's roots."
361	12187	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our Lives the overall mood of the author is greatfulness. Narciso begins the memoir by telling us how much @CAPS3 appreciates his culture and all that his parents do for him. In paragraph @NUM1, he reflects on the skills they shared, writing, ""... And unwittenly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally greatful)."" This sentiment underscores how @CAPS3 has an optemistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his culture. Most of it had to do with how @CAPS3 grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int @LOCATION1, which gave him a profound respect for their struggles and sacrifices. His gratefulness is therefore deeply rooted in his family's journey and the stable, loving environment they provided for him."
362	12188	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen. He remembers his parents love for cooking, and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him. @PERSON1 remembers the passionate Cuban music mixing with the aromas of the kitchen, creating a vibrant and warm atmosphere. In paragraph three and four, he tells how the environment he grew up in instilled that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative. He recalls past neighbors, and surrogate grandparents, his aunts and cousins. @PERSON1 remembers how there was always someone at the dinner table, and usually someone staying with them until they could get back on their feet, which reinforced a powerful sense of community. In paragraphs five, six, and seven, @PERSON1 expresses his gratitude towards his parents, and how much they had to sacrifice. He states that, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The home @PERSON1 lived in had many happy memories, and instilled that family and friends were important no matter what, leaving him with a lasting sense of belonging and love."
363	12189	5	3	The mood was a little sad at certian times and greatful at others. It was sade that they have to leave Cuba and start all over agin, facing the difficulty of abandoning their homeland. It was greatful becase they hade family that loved them and cared for them, providing essential support during this challenging transition. This blend of emotions captures the complex experience of immigration, where loss and thankfulness are deeply intertwined. Ultimately, the author's reflection shows that even in hardship, the strength of family can provide a foundation for gratitude.
364	12190	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful, happy, and thankful. The author was grateful because he wasn't asked to be born in america, hes parents immigranted to america so that Narciso can live a better life, a sacrifice he deeply values. Narciso was happy because he get to see both of his parents, his grandparents which lives in the basement of his house, and his aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary, all contributing to a lively and close-knit household. Narciso was thankful because he gets a home where he can sleep at, a family who loves him, and he could've ask for nothing better than the life he has now. This overwhelming sense of contentment and appreciation for his family's efforts and presence defines the entire tone of his memoir, highlighting a life filled with love and security.
365	12191	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph the author says, ""... I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 fact is, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, ""I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" acknowledging their immense bravery. I guess he is just very grateful for his parents, his childhood, everything and everyone he has ever met, had or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd be grateful, too. This opened my eyes and now, I, too, am grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life, realizing how important it is to recognize and value the people and opportunities that shape our existence."
366	12192	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very sensitive. And what I mean by that in paragraphs one and two it sounds like the author is getting real emotional. It says in paragraph one, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement reveals a deep sense of appreciation and emotional vulnerability. The author's tone becomes increasingly heartfelt as he reflects on his parents' efforts, which contributes significantly to the overall sensitive and emotional atmosphere of the memoir. This feeling of gratitude and love is the central emotional core that the author successfully conveys to the reader."
367	12193	5	3	"The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. The author is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him feel safe and protected throughout his childhood. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" What this means is that he is grateful for the life he had, a life filled with warmth and family love that transcended their material circumstances. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside, a lasting tribute to his parents' devotion."
368	12194	5	3	"The mood created by the author is that in paragraph two it states that ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. It was the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" I think this relates to the nostalgic mood of the memoir because living in a new country you could still have a house and a lifestyle like you were still living back where you came from, in this case in Cuba. This preservation of culture and tradition within the home creates a warm and comforting atmosphere, highlighting the family's ability to maintain their identity and heritage despite being in a different land."
369	12195	5	3	The mood of the story is happy. She describes how lucky she is to have parents like her own, and to be Cuban. She loves the music, the food, and the vibrant culture that surrounded her upbringing. Her recollections are filled with positive energy and a deep-seated joy for her heritage and family life. She's glad her parents were caring and helped people, which added to her sense of pride and happiness. This overall cheerful mood makes the memoir an uplifting and positive reflection on her life and background.
370	12196	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and uplifting. The author discussed the positives in his life, focusing on the blessings and opportunities he received. He did not dwell on the negatives or say what he would like to change. The positive mood of the memoir made it entertaining and pleasant to read. The author emphasized the fact that his parents moved to America because it was best for their children. They would sacrifice having the jobs that they deserved, putting their children's future ahead of their own professional aspirations. They immigrated to America to give their children a better life, a selfless act that defined their parenting. His parents cared deeply about the future of their kids, and they were unselfish in their dedication. The way in which the author honors his parents makes the story very enjoyable and heartfelt. The mood is positive and keeps the reader interested and involved throughout the narrative. It was a very good story that celebrated family and sacrifice.
371	12197	5	3	"The mood created in this story was one of profound happiness and deep gratefulness towards his parents. In the narrative, he recounted the many sacrifices his parents made to give him a better life than the one they had, leaving behind everything familiar. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" he wrote, reflecting on their unwavering support. ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit of generosity."" His parents came to the country knowing little English and having to start their lives over from nothing, working difficult jobs and facing immense challenges, all just so that his life would be better. This overwhelming sense of thankfulness for their selfless actions defines the emotional core of the story, leaving a lasting impression of familial devotion."
372	12198	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is deeply emotional, characterized by a mixture of sacrifice and hope. The mood is emotional because his family left their homeland, sacrificing their own comfort for the freedom and future of their children. They gave up everything, including their extended family and all that was familiar, solely for the kids' benefit. The fact that they didn't know anybody or the town itself was an amazing leap of faith into the unknown. In this new place, jobs were few, money was scarce, and daily life was a struggle. Yet, the author reflects that even though they were hard times, after they are over, those challenging years become the best times of all because of what was built together. Family, he concludes, can be found and forged in a place with no relatives, and that powerful sentiment is the emotional mood created by the author in the memoir.
373	12199	5	3	The author creates a special and inviting mood in this memoir. The mood the author gives is a very comfortable and welcoming mood, reminiscent of a safe and happy haven. He talks fondly about his family and how they all ate together regularly, sharing meals and stories, and always had relatives stopping by for impromptu visits. This constant flow of family and friends gives you a strong sense of togetherness and community. It gives you a sense of how the family interacted with warmth and became one with the neighborhood, their lives intertwined with those living around them. So the author of this article really shows how just the whole town had a sense of togetherness with the family, creating a portrait of a deeply connected and supportive community life.
374	12200	5	3	"In his memoir *Home: Blueprints of Our Lives*, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm, deeply familial mood that resonates with heartfelt appreciation. Narciso's profound gratitude for his parents' decision to move to the United States has a large effect on the overall mood of the piece. He describes how brave his mother and father must have been to make such a life-changing choice, leaving behind their homeland, and admits that ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude."" The author understands what a large, positive influence his parents have had on him, and his enduring gratitude for his family contributes significantly to the warm mood of the piece. Narciso's admiration for his family also develops the appreciative atmosphere of the memoir. He uses words like selfless and hardworking to describe his family, and tells them of his ""admiration for strength and perseverance."" Through his descriptions of the feats his parents have accomplished and the hardships they have had to endure, the author conveys his feeling of true admiration for his family directly to the reader. However, absolute love is the strongest emotion that the reader feels from the memoir. Narciso uses careful selection of what memories he writes, along with the addition of passionate words like warm, gracious, honest, and close-knit to make the love within his family stand out vividly. Although there were certainly fights within his family, he never mentions them, focusing instead on the underlying bond he felt with his relatives and how the warmth of his kitchen ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Narciso is passionate enough about the atmosphere within his family that he makes the gratitude, admiration, and love he feels for his relatives the central focus of his memoir, crafting a lasting tribute to their legacy."
375	12201	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, I believe he goes from a calm, reflective mood to a profoundly proud and thankful mood. He starts off by calmly describing his life so far and his family origins. He recounts how he used to live in a one-room apartment in Cuba and how his family eventually settled in Newark, New Jersey, living alongside other Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. Then his tone shifts as he talks with pride about the neighborhood and how together they fostered great solidarity and lasting friendships. He describes it as an honest and hard working community, comprised mostly of fellow immigrants supporting one another. He also said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" which underscores his deep appreciation. I think Narciso feels profoundly thankful and proud to be a Cuban and to have such wonderful parents who built a new life. This pride culminates in his final, resonant thought: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a statement that perfectly encapsulates his enduring pride and gratitude."
376	12202	5	3	This memoir creates a warm feeling of nostalgia for the author's home. The author writes about how his parents were able to make a great and loving home out of a small, one-room apartment, filling the limited space with affection and cultural richness. The author also wrote about how his parents raised him while teaching his Cuban heritage, ensuring he understood his roots through stories, food, and family traditions. This deep connection to his past, nurtured within the confines of their humble apartment, is what fuels the author's heartfelt and nostalgic reflection, making the memory of that simple place feel as vast and warm as a palace built on love and cultural pride.
377	12203	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez could not describe his home any better, it was as if I was there with him. I can see he really remembers the sounds, sights, and smells of his home with vivid clarity. ""...situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture. Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That whole paragraph really gave me a good feeling, and I could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the festivities and the constant, comforting hum of family life. Therefore the mood is happy and warm, I would love to be there, immersed in that vibrant atmosphere of music, food, and familial love that he so fondly recalls."
378	12204	5	3	There were many different moods that the author created in the memoir. The three most important moods were grateful, loving, and happy. The first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful. This family was very lucky to move from Cuba to the United States and find a better home and new opportunities. They were also lucky that they were going to have a better life, free from the struggles they left behind. The second most important mood was loving. This family showed a lot of love for each other, supporting one another through the challenges of starting over. An example that shows how loving they are is when it states they left their family, friends, and careers so their children could have a better life, a profound act of sacrifice. The last mood was happiness. When reading this story you can really tell that this family was happy despite the hardships. It talks about how they will never forget the memories and how generous their parents were, always focusing on the joy they found together. In conclusion there were many different moods in this story, but the three main moods that defined their experience were grateful, loving, and happy.
379	12205	5	3	"In the memoir, the author gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because when he describes certain things, like his parents, he would add a loving and caring feeling, emphasizing their kindness and dedication. In paragraph three it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence indicates how much he loved his parents for doing that, creating a place of warmth and security. Also in paragraph five it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" that indicates how appreciative he was for their selfless actions. Also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you, prompting a reflection on one's own blessings. That is why I think the memoir gives off a loving and caring mood to the readers, successfully conveying a deep sense of familial appreciation and warmth."
380	12206	5	3	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in as invited guests. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family, accepted and valued within the community. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells of cooking and lovely Cuban music playing, creating an atmosphere of open-hearted hospitality. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home and the inclusive spirit that defined his upbringing."
381	12207	5	3	"In the memoir *Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives* by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct and heartfelt mood is created. Rodriguez remembers his childhood home in a refreshed and vivid way. He remembers his parents' ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" which filled the home with wonderful aromas and warmth. He also recalls the ""passionate Cuban music"" that constantly filled the walls of his home, creating a lively and cultural atmosphere. Rodriguez really lets us know that there was a great sense of community and family in his neighborhood. He quotes, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" It sounded like everyone worked together there and helped each other out, creating a supportive environment. ""There was often Someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" he writes, illustrating the open-hearted nature of his family. Narciso says his parents ""came selflessly"" to the United States ""to give there children a better life."" Narciso is very thankful for his parents' immigration struggle and says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Through these experiences, Narciso Rodriguez ""learned the real definition of 'family,' 'Love"" and carries these foundational memories with him wherever he goes in his life."
382	12208	5	3	"There are many interconnected moods created in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez. One of the primary moods is loving, which is powerfully conveyed when he states, ""I learned here how to love."" His mood is also deeply caring, as evidenced by his description that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family."" This open-door policy extended their sense of kinship beyond blood relations. Furthermore, the mood was one of happiness, which Rodriguez captures with the phrase, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations."" These elements of love, care, and joy together define the overall mood of this memoir, painting a picture of a cherished and vibrant upbringing."
383	12209	5	3	The author expressed a profound sense of gratitude throughout the memoir, explaining how thankful they were for their parents' decision to move to a new country. This sacrifice was the foundation upon which their family built a new life. The narrative illustrates how a simple house can be transformed into a true home through the strength of relationships and shared experiences. It powerfully underscores how important family and friends are, showing that these bonds are what create a sense of belonging and warmth. Ultimately, the memoir serves as a tribute to the love and connections that define a home and give life its deepest meaning.
384	12210	5	3	"The mood created by the author brought out a strong Cuban sense of heritage and family. The mood set here is that family doesn't only mean ""blood relatives""; it is about people who need help and will have that same feeling for you if you need that same help. The mood also shows how you have to go through a lot of times where it's hard and you will lament, but you have to get through it and it will pay off. Your culture is a fundamental part of the mood of the story. This family's parents came from Cuba and, despite having a one-bedroom apartment, raised a kid and still helped others. The apartment is turned into a Cuban household, vibrant with food and music and families. The mood elevates and escalates as they spend more time building a life: more family, a better living space, a better job, and most of all, a better understanding. The mood of the whole story really centers around family and the true meaning of family. Family is your loved ones who care and help, who love and respect you. That's the essential mood of the story, a celebration of communal love and resilience."
385	12211	5	3	"The prevailing mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is one of profound love. Love is the defining mood for many compelling reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were exceptionally caring and open-hearted. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph 3). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family, creating an atmosphere of unconditional acceptance. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless in their sacrifices. ""With courage they moved to the United States without knowledge of the language or the culture."" He adds, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph 5). His parents did everything out of pure love for their children. Because of their sacrifices and the environment they created, Narciso lived a life filled with happiness and love, which became the core of his cherished memories."
386	12212	5	3	"In this @DATE1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" Narciso Rodriguez creates a safe, calm, and secure mood. His description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 says ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS1 just a backdrop. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community..."" and ""countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way Narciso described his family and neighborhood keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong, fostering a deep sense of belonging. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and profoundly grateful mood in his @DATE1, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of familial love and community spirit."
387	12213	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremely grateful."" @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him. Furthermore, the line ""I've often told them my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly"" also shows how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful. It also shows how the author is happy about his parents' decisions and the life they provided for him, which solidifies the overall tone of heartfelt appreciation and contentment that permeates the entire memoir."
388	12214	5	3	The mood described by the author is homely. In the excerpt the author invites you into his own house, his own life, which creates a nice and welcoming mood. He vividly describes how everyone in his neighborhood got along and that everyone was considered family, contributing to a strong sense of community. This feeling of inclusivity and mutual support makes the atmosphere feel warm and secure. The author’s recollections paint a picture of a life filled with familiar comforts and reliable relationships, ultimately establishing a deeply homely and affectionate mood that resonates throughout the text.
389	12215	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a grateful one because it is telling you what his experience in life was, and what his parents were like. It is also my opinion that they liked where they were. One reason is because they liked to cook all the time, which suggests a joyful and nurturing home environment. Another reason is that they liked to have fun with their son, indicating a household filled with love and laughter. One last reason is because they had a son, whose presence was a central source of their happiness and motivation. Their @CAPS1 name was @PERSON1. Through these simple yet profound details, the author effectively conveys a deep sense of gratitude for his family and the life they built together.
390	12216	5	3	"What is the mood created by the author in the memoir? The mood created by the author in the memoir would be loving and warm. The fact that Narciso's parents would take people in until they could get back on their feet demonstrates this, as shown by the line, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Furthermore, Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life, sacrificing everything by leaving their families, friends, and careers. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done."" The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso, as he explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" indicating that his first everything was done there. The mood created by the author made me feel grateful for what I have in life, effectively conveying a powerful message about the enduring strength of family and the true meaning of home."
391	12217	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is happy and grateful. In the text, it is described how Narciso's parents gave up all they had to leave Cuba and come to the United States where their children could have a better life. Narciso was so profoundly grateful to them that he couldn't express a thank you in words, a feeling that underscores the depth of his emotion. The memoir also states that he is truly grateful for his parent's love and sacrifice, which formed the foundation of his life. The reason he is happy, I think, is because he has a family that loves him deeply. Even though they're from different cultures, they came together as a family, and that beautiful union wouldn't have happened if his parents hadn't made the courageous decision to immigrate. That is why I think the overall mood is happy and truly grateful."
392	12218	5	3	The mood created by the author is welcoming and warm. The author makes it so that you want to be there in that setting, immersed in the experience and being able to smell the good food that filled the air. The description evokes a sense of comfort and community, allowing the reader to appreciate the richness of the Cuban culture being shared. It is a mood that makes one feel included and at ease, fully appreciating the simple joys of family and tradition.
393	12219	5	3	"In the memoir, from ""Home: the blue prints of our lives,"" the mood created by the author is happy, thankful and also family-oriented. First, the narrator says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"", and by that you can tell the narrator loved that new home, and that she loved and appreciated everything her parents did for her. Second, the line ""... instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"" shows that the narrator treats and acts like everyone in her community is her ""family"". She loves and cares for all of her ""family"" that isn't blood relative in her neighborhood as if they were blood relatives. Last, the memoir says ""... endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". When the narrator says ""warm home,"" that meant she loved being home with her family and friends. She loved being with her friends and neighbors, because that is what she loved to do and what brought her joy. Therefore, the narrator is happy and content with her life."
394	12220	5	3	The mood in the memoir is basically showing love, happiness, and friendship. The way that the mood shows love is in the descriptions provided. In one part, it says Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not, indicating a loving and joyful presence. In another part, it talks about how his parents welcomed refugees to celebrate their arrival to America, demonstrating open-hearted generosity. Happiness was shown throughout the story as a result of this loving atmosphere. And friendship was shown as well through the parents' actions of keeping their door open to those who did not have a home. They let them stay in their home until they were back on their feet, and considered them part of the family, which perfectly illustrates the themes of friendship and inclusive love.
395	12221	5	3	"This memoir creates a peaceful mood. It is telling us of his childhood, a time often associated with simplicity and safety. Narciso writes, ""In 1961 I was born into this simple house,"" setting a tone of humble beginnings. As a child you often have nothing but peace, and his recollection supports this. He had many visitors, which added to the lively yet serene atmosphere. He writes that ""my mother took in refugees, welcoming them into the country,"" showing a kind and open household. He obviously had a nice environment with all those visitors, creating a sense of constant, warm community. He is explaining his past with clear affection. He loves his house and the environment it creates, stating, ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home."" This reflection just puts your mind at ease, recalling a foundational sense of security. That is how this article creates a peaceful mood."
396	12222	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness and contentment. The author is happy about how, after leaving the place she used to live to move to a new location, she made it feel just like home. Instead of looking back with longing and thinking no place could ever take the place of her real home, she embraced her new surroundings with a positive and forward-looking attitude. This optimistic perspective allowed her to build a new life filled with the same warmth and familiarity she had cherished before. The author was consistently positive about this memoir, reflecting on her experience with a sense of joy and successful adaptation, ultimately finding happiness in her new beginning.
397	12223	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get by. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot, leaving behind their previous lives for new opportunities. Narciso's parents, for instance, had highly skilled, well-paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find upon arriving in their new city. Despite these hardships, a strong sense of community prevailed. They would always help someone in their family if necessary, and often did, sharing the little they had. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by with resilience and a positive spirit. They did all this without losing their culture, as the sounds of Cuban music and the aromas of traditional food remained central to their daily lives. Their entire neighborhood, functioning as one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only definition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey; it was defined by shared struggle, mutual support, and collective strength.
398	12224	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is both hard and happy. The first place in the story when the author creates a hard mood is when they state that racism was overt. The mention of ""Spanish, black, and Asian immigrants facing overt racism"" shows that the mood is hard because we know that at that time such prejudice was occurring, making it difficult for them to fit in with everybody else and creating a challenging environment. The last place in the story where the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together as a community. The line, ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" displays a happy mood because it represents a whole bunch of different people coming together to work and support one another, overcoming the divisions they faced. As you can see, the author creates two different types of moods, hard and happy, effectively capturing the complex reality of immigrant life."
399	12225	5	3	"The author tells the story of his childhood and the feel-good times of his family in a small house in Newark. Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each passing day. The phrases he uses to help describe the house, like ""passionate Cuban music filled the air"" and ""the congregation of family,"" established this vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming household he grew up in, a place always full of life and sound. The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own, highlighting their generosity. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with ""extended family"" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen filled with conversation and laughter. As the author goes on to tell how grateful he is for his parents and his wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and a down-to-earth honesty from the author, a genuine reflection on his past. The excerpt recreates a feel-good time of a carefree life and worryless days that provide a wonderful, comforting atmosphere for the reader, inviting them into this cherished memory."
400	12226	5	3	"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving but most prominently one of gratitude. Time and time again the author shows his gratitude toward his parents for making life for him growing up special in a loving atmosphere. He describes how grateful he is for his parents cooking when he says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" In the same paragraph he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air [...]"" showing how these sensory experiences shaped his happy childhood. His parents taught him to be open and loving to others as said in the text ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring. He best expresses his gratitude when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and when he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" a sentiment that perfectly encapsulates the profound thankfulness that defines the entire memoir."
401	12227	5	3	the @CAPS1 mood was good as he shared specific details about his personal background, telling the reader where he was from and how his parents were, among other things. He provided a clear picture of his origins and family life, which helped to establish a positive and open tone from the very beginning. This foundational information set the stage for the rest of his narrative, allowing the reader to understand the context of his experiences. By being forthcoming with these personal facts, he created an immediate connection and a sense of authenticity. The overall impression was one of warmth and candidness, effectively introducing his story. This approach ensured the narrative was grounded and relatable from the start.
402	12228	5	3	The mood the author creates shifts from the profound sadness of leaving one country where friends and family lived to the quiet happiness found in the new times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states, the center of the home was the kitchen where her parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air alongside the kitchen's rich aroma. This kitchen served as the vibrant backdrop to life in their new home, a place where old and new traditions mingled. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their determined hope of creating a better life for the family, even though it meant leaving their country, friends, and family behind. Underpinning it all is a consistent mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister through their daily actions. These are the complex and heartfelt moods the author skillfully creates throughout the memoir, painting a full emotional picture of their journey.
403	12229	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of ease and welcome, as they had no problem finding a house and settling in. For example, the author states, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This means that they are great cooks and have skills for cooking, which contributed to a warm and nurturing home atmosphere. Furthermore, the text notes, ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us."" This detail shows that even though they first came to the @CAPS1, they had no problem finding a home and even built immediate, friendly connections. The author adds, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This is saying his mom keeps the traditions alive with all the celebrations for newcomers to @LOCATION1, fostering a mood of community and continuity. The overall feeling is one of seamless transition and generous hospitality."
404	12230	5	3	In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parents were, as they left their entire lives behind in Cuba to give their children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary—warm, full of Cuban heritage, and alive with the smells of cooking and the sounds of music. Family members were always around, visiting frequently for dinner, which added to the sense of a close-knit community. It was a safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion, a true haven of comfort and cultural pride. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this same comforting way. Narciso was indeed a very lucky boy to be brought up in such a nurturing and loving environment, which left a lasting positive impression.
405	12231	5	3	"The author in the memoir from *Home: The Blueprints of our Lives* creates the mood of gratitude and admiration towards his parents. One example of how the author shows gratitude is by mentioning how thankful he is toward his parents. Specific textual evidence that proves this is ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating ""eternally grateful"". Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves this is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 the author's use and repetition of the word ""grateful"" creates a consistent and powerful mood of thankfulness. Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text he says, ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them directly. The author also creates the mood of admiration when he says ""... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" @CAPS2 in this quotation the author recognizes that his parents faced many hardships, and he praises them by showing his deep admiration for their bravery. This dual mood of gratitude and admiration forms the emotional core of the memoir."
406	12232	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcoming. Inside the @PERSON1 home, the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmosphere, one filled with the comforting sounds and smells of a vibrant household. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote effectively shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home truly was, a place of constant togetherness. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people were and that everyone in the apartment building was friends or even considered family, creating a tight-knit community. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote clearly means that in his welcoming home, friends were also considered his family, a value he carried with him. Ultimately, Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in, one that shaped his understanding of love and belonging."
407	12233	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation, which together establish a calm and straightforward narrative. The author's voice is very blunt; for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir, reinforcing its uncomplicated nature. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir, which gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something. To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation to seamlessly add detail. Parentheses are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes, creating a conversational tone. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives this extra information, it gives the reader a deeper sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home,"" which is the central topic of the memoir, thus completing the tranquil atmosphere."
408	12234	5	3	The mood that is described in this story is love. Why did I pick love? I picked love because in the story it says a lot of stuff about family and Cuba and home, with Cuba being where the love, specifically from his family, is centered. In this story it states that his love comes from his family and that love comes from every family, and @PERSON1's loves his family, a sentiment he says a lot in the story through his affectionate recollections. This recurring emphasis on familial affection solidifies the overall mood of deep, abiding love that permeates his memories and defines his experience of home.
409	12235	5	3	In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba, a sacrifice that provided a foundation of safety. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him, using these sensory details to evoke a feeling of comfort and nurture. The unity that the neighborhood had formed was also a key source of this security. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segregation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything to anyone. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them, extending the family's warmth to the wider community. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story, leaving the reader with a powerful impression of a sheltered and affectionate upbringing.
410	12236	5	3	"The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir, skillfully transitioning between them. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe, surrounded by familiar customs. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all portrayed in a positive light that emphasizes affection and security. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family, shifting the emotional tone. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them (his parents) to endure these hard times."" This powerful statement gives a mood of pride and great triumph, highlighting their resilience. That is the evolving mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" moving from comfort to dignified accomplishment."
411	12237	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy tone. The reasons that it is a happy tone is because the author tells about her childhood happily by talking about the unity of his environment and the happiness, Cuban food, and Cuban music that filled his home and that still fills his home today because he enjoys it so much. The vibrant flavors of the food and the rhythmic sounds of the music are described as constant sources of joy, contributing to a warm and cheerful atmosphere that defines his recollections. This consistent celebration of his cultural heritage and family life establishes an overwhelmingly positive and joyful feeling throughout the narrative, leaving the reader with a strong sense of the author's enduring contentment and appreciation for his upbringing.
412	12238	5	3	"In the memoir there is a lot of different moods such as mad, sad, and hopeful. I think that over all it is a happy memoir because in the story it says ""and for which I am eternally grateful"" and also ""Which I adored to this day."" These direct quotations from the text highlight a deep-seated sense of thankfulness and lasting pleasure that overshadow the more fleeting moments of other emotions. The author's expression of eternal gratitude and continued adoration for elements of his past points directly to a fundamentally positive reflection on his experiences. Therefore, I think that over all it is a happy mood, because there is a lot of evidence to help support it, with these phrases serving as the cornerstone for this interpretation."
413	12239	5	3	The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you is pretty much the happiness and gratefulness that Narciso Rodriguez has for being Cuban. Narciso is bringing the mood of happiness in this memoir learning all about his Cuban background and how much he is grateful for his mom and dad. The author is trying to show you appreciation and gratefulness through specific recollections of family traditions and parental sacrifices. This whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things, emphasizing the richness it adds to one's life. This memoir is representing good moods and happiness, ultimately conveying a message to always be grateful for what you have in your life, especially your family, friends, and your life itself. The mood in this memoir is very happy and grateful, creating an inspiring and uplifting narrative for the reader.
414	12240	5	3	"The author creates moods in the memoir that seem to be positive. The first mood that is shown is a loving mood. In paragraph three it states, ""All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This shows when all the immigrants came to the new location they would be discriminated against, yet they all came together and became a family, fostering a powerful sense of community. Another mood that is created is careness. Narciso Rodriguez's parents showed so much love and support towards him. Paragraph five says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This quote shows that even before Narciso was born his parents were thinking about him, demonstrating profound foresight and devotion. Narciso's parents wanted their child to have a good life, which fills the narrative with a sense of being cherished. A final mood would be happiness. Narciso is very happy and has a lot of gratitude for his parents. Narciso quotes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" By Narciso saying that it shows how much he loves his parents and how happy he is living in his community, concluding the excerpt on a note of profound personal joy. The author creates different moods throughout the entire excerpt, weaving them together to form a cohesive and heartwarming portrait."
415	12241	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* there is a mood of happiness created. There are several examples from the article that show happiness. The first example is ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life"". Narciso's parents left everything they had just to give their son a better life, an act whose significance fills him with a deep and abiding joy. This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. The second example is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows he is very aware of all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much, a realization that forms the emotional core of his gratitude. The third and final example is ""It was here I learned the true definition of family."" Where he moved to, his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his ""family"" and although he didn't know all of his ""real"" family he was happy with the one he had, finding profound contentment in this chosen kinship. Those three examples clearly show the predominant mood of happiness in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" illustrating how gratitude and love define his life story."
416	12242	5	3	"The mood created by the author's tone in this memoir is appreciation which is displayed in three important places. First, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, creates the mood of appreciation when talking about how his parents left Cuba. He explains ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM1). This description shows the mood of appreciation because it shows the author's parents left ""selflessly"", ""to give their children a better life,"" which implies that his parents @MONTH1 not have wanted to come to @LOCATION1, but they knew it would be the best place for him, so they came anyway, which clearly creates a mood of appreciation through Narciso's tone. Additionally, the mood of appreciation is created when Rodriguez declares ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM2). This informs the reader outright that Rodriguez is ""grateful to his parents"", which creates the mood of appreciation should through his tone. Finally, the mood of appreciation is created when Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). This statement insinuates appreciation because Rodriguez is informing the reader that ""he will never forget"", what his parents have done for him, which carries the message that it changed his life, creating the mood of appreciation through his tone. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the mood of appreciation through his tone in this memoir to his parents, consistently highlighting their selfless acts and enduring impact on his life."
417	12243	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and positive mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his feelings toward his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be grateful for my parents"", ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful, reflecting a deep sense of respect. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set, which provided him with a strong foundation. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt, celebrating their legacy and influence."
418	12244	5	3	"This is the mood that was conveyed by the author in the memoir. The mood is a very happy one. The author looks back on all the good times @CAPS1 had as a kid. @CAPS1 explains how Cuban culture was a big part of his life and how @CAPS1 still enjoys Cuban food and music, which brings him joy. @CAPS1 also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home, filled with warmth and love. In the last line @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also talks about how @CAPS1 lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world. @CAPS1 describes how even though the families from different places had almost nothing in common they'll all became very close. In the third paragraph it says, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That quote shows how close that neighborhood was even though they came from different places. The mood is happy in that memoir because @CAPS1 only revisits memories that @CAPS1 was fond of, focusing on the positive aspects of his upbringing. That was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir."
419	12245	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood. The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence, establishing a calm and reflective pace. He then goes on about his life, recounting memories without urgency. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more, all in a conversational style. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for, maintaining this composed tone. The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and laid back, which effectively conveys a sense of peaceful recollection to the reader."
420	12246	5	3	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a certain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the mood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood relatives, but was instead defined by close bonds. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc., creating an extended family network. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him, a vital part of his support system. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family, and this affection was demonstrated through daily actions. They always came over and had dinner, babysat him and every thing; that is why it is love, as these acts were rooted in deep care and mutual affection.
421	12247	5	3	As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created, but rather a profound feeling that emerged. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished that dream with a little hope and consistent hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was deeply grateful for this inheritance. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who his family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them, finding wealth in these simple, enduring relationships. This consistent theme of appreciating non-material riches solidifies the overall uplifting mood of the narrative.
422	12248	5	3	"The author of the memoir set a distinct mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was clearly set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again, reinforcing the central theme. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling, a sense of comfort and appreciation. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to America they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life with their love and spirit, and for that he is profoundly grateful."
423	12249	5	3	He is very greatfull to live in America and even with all the racism he still found ways to have fun and enjoy life. Despite the challenges and prejudice he faced, his spirit remained resilient. He focused on the positive aspects of his community and the love within his family, which provided a strong foundation for his happiness. This ability to find joy and maintain gratitude in the face of adversity highlights his positive outlook and deep appreciation for the opportunities and relationships he had. His experience shows that a sense of thankfulness can flourish even when external circumstances are difficult.
424	12250	5	3	The mood created by the author is happy, as the narrator was happy that she got to live in America and be raised in America. She is happy because shes lived In the Same house in New Jersey all her life then finally got to meet her grandparents In 1970 When she turned eight years old.

The accumulation of these positive experiences in a stable environment, culminating in the long-awaited meeting with her grandparents, firmly establishes the contented and joyful mood that defines her recollection of her childhood and her appreciation for her homeland.
425	12251	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it, filled with love and acceptance. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home, demonstrating how gratitude and love are the true foundations of a happy life."
426	12252	5	3	"A happy, grateful, and proud mood is expressed by the author in this memoir. The author, Narciso, expressed a grateful and happy mood by describing things his parents did for him that he was grateful for, as well as happy to have, such as instilling in him a lifelong passion for cooking and a deep love for Cuban music. ""... a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The author also expressed his pride in the story, by stating and describing what his parents did that he was proud of, highlighting their immense bravery in starting a new life. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) These were the primary moods the author expressed in the memoir, creating a tone of deep appreciation and familial pride."
427	12253	5	3	"The mood created by the author was very happy and filled with gratitude. The author was deeply grateful to his parents for the life they built. For example in paragraph @NUM1: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength and for the example they set through their resilience. For example in paragraph @NUM1: ""I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @CAPS1 will never forget his home and the warmth it provided. For example from paragraph @NUM3: ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" The mood was very happy, as the author reflected on a childhood filled with love, making him feel grateful, thankful, and forever connected to the home his parents created."
428	12254	5	3	The memoir created a predominantly happy mood about the family's new life. Living in @LOCATION1 is great for the family, as it offered them a better chance in life than being in Cuba. @LOCATION1 has a lot of opportunities for work and education, and the family emphasized the importance of staying together. Having friends come over, both relatives and non-relatives, is great and filled their home with joy and community. This sense of belonging and support contributed to a positive outlook, giving you a better mood in the day to come as you face the world with optimism and a strong support system.
429	12255	5	3	The mood that the author created in this memoir is kinda sad because these immigrants that came to America selflessly just to give their children a better life faced many hardships. These immigrants do not have a lot to work with upon arrival. They often live in small homes that are dirty and cramped, but in a surprising way they manage to persevere. Despite the difficulties, all these immigrants from different cultures that live in the same neighborhood came together in great solidarity and friendship, offering each other support. There are other immigrants that are unlucky and don't find jobs or houses, and they have to either leave or stay temporarily with other people until they can get back on their feet. In conclusion, in this memoir the author created a very sad mood as you can see from the some of the specific details from the story I have included, highlighting the struggles inherent in the immigrant experience.
430	12256	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", is a complex mixture of happiness, relaxation, and gratefulness. Even though the memoir sometimes states how @PERSON1's parents had to give up their jobs in Cuba, and how overt racism was normal and segregation prevailed in the United States at the time, giving the mood a layer of sadness, the article mainly consists of happy memories. An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with each other, and how they frequently had meals together, creating a strong sense of community. I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. The over all mood of the memoir could be considered gratefulness, because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and childhood, which overshadows the mentioned difficulties."
431	12257	5	3	The mood in the story is very homely and filled with happiness. The author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background, one built on a foundation of security and affection. The author was very grateful for the parents for what they have done, for moving to @LOCATION1 and making significant sacrifices, all because they wanted a better life for their children. Also how their home was a great environment, one that was always open and welcoming, cozy, and loving to all who entered. The mood evoked by the cooking, the family coming together to share meals, and of the cheerful music playing in the background is just great, creating an enduring sense of joy and contentment that defines the author's cherished memories.
432	12258	5	3	The mood of this memoir is a good one, characterized by warmth and deep appreciation. It describes how a house is not the same as a home, as articulated in the last sentence of the memoir, emphasizing that a home is built on love and shared experiences rather than mere physical walls. Furthermore, it illustrates how family is more than just blood relatives, extending to the close friends and community who offer unconditional support and belonging. This central idea reinforces the positive and inclusive atmosphere that the author successfully cultivates throughout the narrative, leaving the reader with a profound understanding of what truly constitutes a family and a home.

Overall, the mood is happy and deeply affirming, highlighting the simple yet powerful joy found in a loving and inclusive family life.
434	12260	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and fond remembrance. This is because the memoir describes how many cherished memories are contained within his house, each room holding echoes of the past. It is also happiness because he mentioned his family and friends who gathered there, and how peaceful and secure the environment felt. Also because he describes that there was a @CAPS1 Cuban music that filled the air, adding a layer of cultural joy and lively rhythm to the atmosphere. He also described where his house is located and how he loves cooking, which he describes as a rich, culinary tradition that he loves so much, a passion that further contributes to the warm and joyful mood of the narrative, solidifying the home as a place of sensory delight and heartfelt nostalgia.
435	12261	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, uses detailed descriptions of her childhood to create a warm, gentle, and grateful mood throughout the passage. The memoir begins with Rodriguez explaining her Cuban heritage and how big of a role that played in her life, detailing the traditions and values passed down through generations. This creates an idea of pride and love for who you are and where you come from. Narciso goes on to say how her parents were always welcoming and inviting, their home a hub of activity and warmth, and how they sacrificed basically their whole life so they could make a better life for their children. In the final paragraphs, the author expresses pure gratitude for everything her parents have given up and done, reflecting on their selflessness. In one line, Rodriguez praises her parents when she thanks them again, saying, ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" All of these details contribute to the overall mood of the memoir, which is one of deep thankfulness and loving remembrance for a childhood defined by sacrifice and unconditional love."
436	12262	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 he writes mainly about how grateful he is for everything he grew up with and is truly the mood created by the author. Narciso is grateful for his Cuban culture and how it was incorporated into his life growing up even though he was in New Jersey, with the vibrant sounds, flavors, and traditions creating a constant, comforting presence. He is also grateful for his parents and the sacrifices they made for him in order to grow up in @LOCATION2, recognizing the immense effort and love behind their decisions. His parents also taught him to be kind to everyone, and treat everyone like family, a value he carried with him throughout his life. He is grateful for that foundational lesson in compassion and community, which shaped his worldview profoundly."
437	12263	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is one of profound happiness and warmth. The author creates a very happy and appreciative mood in this memoir. Here he describes how the people in his neighborhood acted towards each other, illustrating a deep sense of community. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" The people in his neighborhood were very kind and generous people who looked out for one another. They helped each other whenever one was in need, creating a supportive environment. The author makes the reader smile when reading about such a place, evoking a sense of idealistic nostalgia. Another example of this is when he writes, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To see such selfless acts is just wonderful and deeply moving. The way the people sacrificed their own comforts for their child's future is amazing and inspiring. Reading about this just warms a person's heart with its sincerity. Another example proving this mood is when the author writes, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author is very proud of where he grew up and the love that filled that space. It @MONTH1 not have been perfect, but he managed to find the good parts and cherish them fondly. It is his genuine pride and fond remembrance that makes the readers feel happy for him and his experiences. Thus, the overwhelmingly positive mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is one of heartfelt happiness."
438	12264	5	3	"There are many ways to explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2. One way to explain the @CAPS1 created by the author is that he is so grateful for having parents that care about him and want him to get a good education, which provided him with a strong foundation for his future. The second way is that @CAPS1 is always happy at his home, where he always has some Cuban spirit present in his daily life. His parents cook Cuban food and have their family together, maintaining a vibrant connection to their heritage. The third way is that he loved his house and how his parents made it so comfortable and full of life; his parents made so many of his birthdays there, and he had a great time at that house, creating lasting, joyful memories. The quote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" perfectly captures this deep sentimental attachment. These are some of the key ways the distinctive @CAPS1 is effectively created and conveyed throughout the narrative."
439	12265	5	3	In this memoir the mood sounds like a genuinely happy and appreciative one. An example of how you might know this is in paragraph @NUM1 when it described what he loved doing with his parents and family, highlighting moments of simple, shared joy. Also, throughout the whole memoir you can feel the palpable happiness when he talks about eating dinner with all his family members and friends, where laughter and conversation filled the room. One more detail about the mood is that he sounds very grateful for what his parents did and the hard choice they had to make about moving to @LOCATION1, acknowledging their sacrifice with deep respect and love. There are some clear and consistent details throughout the text that strongly support why I think the overarching mood of this memoir is one of happiness and gratitude.
440	12266	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and warmly nostalgic setting. In the memoir, the setting contributes to a happy atmosphere, in a sense of living fully and contentedly, because in the passage, there are parenthetical elements that explain how much the narrator appreciates his family and his heritage. In the passage in paragraph @NUM1, it explains how the families are close and help those in need, even when things are not going so smoothly for them, demonstrating resilience and community spirit. Also, there are certain words in the passage that would help establish the mood, words such as selflessly, solidarity, love, friendship, and sacrifice, which evoke positive and heartfelt emotions. In my opinion, these specific words help bring the mood to a happy, calming feeling throughout the passage, making it feel comforting and uplifting. Ultimately, this distinctly ""happy"" mood is successfully and consistently created by the author in this memoir."
441	12267	5	3	The mood the author used in the memoir is showing how proud their family is.

They have an extended family because they live with their grandparents, which creates a strong, multi-generational bond. Narciso is very proud to live in the family she is, and grateful that her parents did all of that for her, a feeling that permeates the entire narrative and defines its emotional core.

The author is grateful that his parents were selfless and gave him a home in Newark, New Jersey. He is grateful because his parents helped out other people move into @LOCATION2 and weren't selfish; they let strangers live in their home until they were ready to move on, an act of profound generosity. This welcoming spirit contributed significantly to the positive atmosphere of his childhood. In the last sentence it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That is the mood of Narciso Rodriguez as he was growing up, one defined by warmth and thankfulness for his family's compassionate nature."
443	12269	5	3	"The author created the mood of happiness that the authors parents went through such struggle, but in the end everything turned out fine because they have family. The author sets the tone of the struggle by describing the author's parents first home ""A furnished one-room apartment,"" and that ""racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the united States"" @CAPS1 explains how her family had a hard time with money and that people were racist to them because of their background. But, then @CAPS1 describes how @CAPS1 overcame the struggle of her parents and the racism by uniting with all the other immigrants living in their neighborhood. ""Despite customs elsewhere , all of these cultures came together in greater solidarity and friendship"". This sets the tone that even though there were many bad things going on, they overcame it. @CAPS1 also sets that mood when @CAPS1 describes her traditional home. @CAPS1 says there was great food, ""passionate cuban music"", and ""the congregation of family and friends"". This sentence makes the reader feel happiness that they could go through such bad times of leaving their homelands to a neighborhood full of friendship and happiness. The author sets the tone by first describing harsh times, and then talking about how happy her home is because @CAPS1 had her family and friends. Overall, the author sets the tone of happiness that this family overcame struggle, finding joy and community despite the initial adversity they faced."
444	12270	5	3	"Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, he portrays a happy, uplifting, positive mood that explains how close his family was and what being a family means to him. It also describes how grateful he is toward his parents and how proud he is of his Cuban culture.First of all, Narciso believes that to be a family, you don't have to be blood related to that person. In paragraph @NUM1, he says: ""Ö All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close ñ knit communityÖ"" This quote explains how much he valued his friends, neighbors, and other family members; and how all three of these categories formed the house he called home.Secondly, the mood of the memoir was not only centered around family and friends, but Narciso also showed much gratitude toward his parents.

And all three of these things helped make his ""house a home,"" creating the uplifting and heartfelt mood that defines his personal history."
445	12271	5	3	The mood in the memoir is loving. It is loving because the authors parent's let pretty much anyone in need, come to live in their house. They did this because they knew if they were in need other people would do that for them. This open-door policy was a direct reflection of their compassionate and empathetic character. Their actions created a household atmosphere that was consistently warm and welcoming to all. This recurring theme of unconditional hospitality is central to establishing the deeply loving mood that characterizes the entire memoir.
446	12272	5	3	"In his memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso Rodriguez shows the story of how a young boy's home and parents have changed his life forever. Originally from Cuba, his parents immigrated to the United States in 1956. They started off in a small apartment, working diligently, then later getting the money to move into a ""simple house."" He reflects that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relation."" He truly believes that some of the most loving families are not related. The mood in this memoir is inspiring to the narrator, filled with gratitude and reflection. This allows the reader to feel such love and happiness which is being expressed.

Overall the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a story full of love and should be told for generations to come. The main lesson here is don't take your family for granted, as the narrator is forever grateful that his parents ""turned this simple house into a home."""
447	12273	5	3	"The mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author. One of the moods that was created in the memoir was happiness. Back in his past, his parents shared all of their Cuban family recipes, and they had a lot of family and friend celebrations with the rest of the neighborhood, sharing friendship and helping others in need. He notes that as long as you can see, the family and the neighbors all came together as one big family to be happy, to make a happy community, and that made the memoir happy. Another mood that was created by the author was a gentle sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times with a sense of nostalgia. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything. He talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to get further away, and the mood changes to sadness. The memories are growing old, but he will always remember his ""family"" and his name, carrying them with him always. The author did a great job at creating those two moods and putting them into his memoir."
448	12274	5	3	"The narrator is trying to describe his house when he was a kid, focusing on the vibrant life within it. In this case he describes his Cuban heritage and how being Cuban is really fun and amazing, filled with warmth and community. The narrator is saying that the Cuban kitchen is pouring out with amazing foods and during holidays his ""Family"" would come and visit, making the house burst with energy and laughter. Cuban is a very exciting culture is what pops into my head after reading this story, with its rich traditions and close-knit bonds. The mood is that festivities and holidays are the best for him, representing a time of pure joy and togetherness that defined his childhood."
449	12275	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir would be how fortunate we are to be living here in the United States and how lucky we are to have our education and our friends and families here with us. It is a mood of profound gratitude and appreciation for the opportunities and relationships that shape our lives. For example, in the text when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" this sentiment perfectly captures the reflective and thankful mood.

450	12276	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is their feelings, a complex mix of nostalgia and thankfulness. In one part, it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home."" For that quote, the author's mood is sometimes sad and sometimes happy, bittersweet in remembrance. The author's mood about being sometimes sad is because of how they live and the passage of those cherished times.

In another part, it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" For that quote, the author's mood is surprised and thankful. The author's feeling is surprised because she would never think her parent would do that for her, creating such a profound sense of belonging from modest means.

And at first they struggled, facing uncertainty and hardship, but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future. This love extended to a deep affection for his culture that came from Cuba, vividly expressed through the vibrant music and the comforting, familiar food. And most of all, it was love for the place he had called home, which was not merely the physical space, but everything and everyone surrounding him, creating a true sense of belonging and community.

It makes you feel like you were there in that vibrant neighborhood and that you wish your own family could be like that, so full of unconditional support. You wish and hope that you could have a life like that where everyone will do anything for you and everyone is so close, sharing their lives and having dinner every night together. He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live, emphasizing that richness comes from relationships. That even though you left your family, friends, and jobs, everything is okay because you are with each other, building a new life. You are with your family, but they are not your blood family; they are your chosen family, bonded by shared experience. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to America, and they are just having fun celebrating their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family; they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba, creating a network of care. It just makes you think about your own family and all they do for you, inspiring a deep sense of appreciation and reflection on the meaning of home.

To conclude, the author used many examples to explain to readers the abundant love that was shared in his home, painting a vivid picture of a nurturing and deeply connected environment."
459	12285	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells about his life at home when he was a child. The mood of this story is happy because he tells how selfless his parents were and how his family always looked out for one another; even though they weren't the richest family they still stuck together through all challenges. In a specific paragraph, it says how the teachings and values from his childhood have stuck with him his whole life and how important family and his friends were to him which creates a warm and comforting setting. This enduring sense of gratitude and fond remembrance for the simple yet profound moments of his youth defines the overall positive tone of his recollections, showing how a loving family environment was the greatest wealth he could have possessed.

He reflects fondly on the close quarters, which fostered a deep sense of togetherness and shared experience. Despite the modest living conditions, his narrative is filled with appreciation for the love, support, and life lessons his family provided within those walls. This gratitude for his family's unwavering presence and the simple joys of his childhood forms the heart of his happy and contented reflection on the past.
461	12287	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez he created a mood of happiness and joyfulness. Narciso Rodriguez creates this mood by showing the generosity his parents have towards their son, family and friends. I also feel another mood that Narciso expresses is love. I say this because his parents sacrifice everything they had because they wanted a better life for their son. ""The faith that this struggle with lead them and their children to better times dove them to endure these hard times"". In this quote is love. Narciso's parent's knew that for him to have a better life they would need to sacrifice theirs. Their actions were driven by a profound and selfless love, which permeates the entire narrative. That is why i feel love is a mood portrayed in the memoir, as it is the foundation for all the happiness and generosity described."
462	12288	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was in a very thankful mood. The author shows how proud he was of his parents and how thankful he is for their efforts and guidance. He also liked his new environment, and he was surprised how all the cultures fit together with no problem, creating a harmonious and welcoming atmosphere. He also explains how grateful he was to his parents for their love and sacrifice, recognizing the hardships they endured for his benefit. In conclusion, the author was very proud and thankful to his parents for providing him with a life full of opportunity and cultural richness.
463	12289	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness and thankfulness. In the memoir the author talks about how grateful he is to his parents and how happy he was when he lived with them. He reflects on the warmth and security of his family home, which was filled with love and support. This deep sense of appreciation for his upbringing and the joyful memories associated with it defines the overall emotional tone of the writing, leaving the reader with a strong impression of a cherished and positive past.
464	12290	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author makes the mood seem familiar and loving. He created a mood very uplifting and loving as if to say your childhood and family is the heart of your home. In paragraph two the author states that he had lived in a home were celebrations formed a backdrop to life in his warm home. What the author means is, family and friends made the home feel inviting and comfortable. The author also explains restating from paragraph four ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This sentence explains that even if their friends and family had no were to go, they were always welcome in their home. This memoir creates a very loving mood. In the last paragraph the author explains that home is were he learned the real definition of family and love, a lesson that clearly shaped his entire outlook on life."
465	12291	5	3	"There are three things that describe the home in this memoir. One of them is the author's love for his Cuban heritage. ""The Cuban music [which I love to this day] filled the air, mixing with the aroma of the kitchen."" This sensory detail vividly brings his cultural background to life. Another way the author describes the home is the houses his parents owned. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey"". The last thing that describes the home is the love and sacrifice that they gave their son. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. Cuban food and music were every were."" This is how the author describes the home in this memoir, painting a picture of a place defined by culture, community, and familial devotion."
466	12292	5	3	The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy appreciates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life, a sacrifice that fills him with profound gratitude. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home through their love and effort. He reflects on their selfless actions, which created a warm and secure environment for him. So that's the mood of the memoir, one of heartfelt appreciation and joyful remembrance for the life his parents built.
467	12293	5	3	"In the memoir, the author created a mood. The mood was a very good one that shows everyone that reads it, that the human race can be genuinely kind and helpful, extending beyond immediate relations. No matter what race you are or where you come from, you don't have to be blood related to be ""family"" and we can all extend a hand to the people that need the most help, creating a supportive community. The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed a lot for him; he is very thankful to them for that profound gift. He tells them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then he could've ever done and he has great admiration for their strength and perseverance in the face of immense challenges. Being an immigrant you have to be unselfish because most parents do it to give their children a better life, putting their children's futures first. The author learned the real definition of ""family"" from this experience and for that, he said he'll never forget that house or the many things about how to love. In the memoir, it creates a peaceful and uplifting mood."
468	12294	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is to never forget what home is if you ever move away or you grow up and you move. Its okay because you will have better memories there at your new house, building a new life filled with its own joys. The author suggests that also if you have the nastiest house, you can always make it into the cleanest house it just takes time, and effort, transforming it through care. Everyone can do it, as the potential for creating a home lies within one's own dedication. It don't matter what you look like or anything, and what you house looks like you still are you, emphasizing that the true value of a home comes from the people within it, not its outward appearance.
469	12295	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is loving and happiness. The mood was happiness and loving toward his two parents, who provided a nurturing foundation for his life. Quote: ""I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice."" This gratitude underscores the positive emotional tone. The mood show that the author had a great childhood and loved his neighborhood very much, feeling a deep connection to his community. Quote: ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many thing I learned there about how to love."" The mood the author created also showed that he didn't care if they didn't have a lot of money, he loved it where he lived and all the people that live in it, even if they weren't a blood relative, valuing relationships over material wealth. Quote: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This reinforces the idea that family is defined by love and support. To wrap it all up, the mood the author created in the memoir was about love and happiness, a reflection of a cherished and contented upbringing."
470	12296	5	3	"The author in the memoir tried to create a specific mood. This mood is appreciation and deep gratitude for his past. He is saying all the things he is thankful for, recounting the blessings of his youth. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly..."" In this quote he is thanking and appreciating all the work his parents went through to give him a good life, acknowledging their immense bravery. He is also admiring the things they went through such as leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved, sacrifices made for his future. He is grateful for the house he lived in and he looks back at the memories of them cooking in the kitchen again, with the smells of Cuban foods, and sounds of Cuban music, sensory details that bring his appreciation to life. He expresses all of this in the last few lines of the memoir that state: ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This final thought solidifies the tone. In conclusion, the author's memoir is all about his appreciation of the good things that came to him in his childhood, and the memories he will never forget, leaving the reader with a sense of his enduring thankfulness."
471	12297	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of our Lives*, the author leaves a friendly, compassionate, and graceful mood. This excerpt leaves a friendly mood because of how much friendliness is given by Narciso Rodriguez's neighborhood at his young age. He recalls, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This sense of unity and mutual support fostered a profoundly amicable atmosphere. Also, this excerpt leaves a compassionate mood because of how much compassion Narciso's parents showed to families of friends who needed a push or help to stand on their feet once again. He writes of ""countless extended family members [who] came and went—and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" This open-hearted generosity exemplifies the deep compassion that characterized his home. Rodriguez leaves a grateful mood when he continues to thank his parents for their love, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... [I have] admiration for their strength and perseverance.. and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Rodriguez uses these wonderful moods to describe his wonderful parents and the foundational values they imparted to him."
472	12298	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one that is used in lots of memoirs because they are like things someone will never forget, as the author vividly illustrates. The author said, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This passing down of traditions and skills created a lasting, fond memory. Furthermore, the author describes how ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This sensory-rich description of sounds and smells contributes to a nostalgic and heartfelt atmosphere. That's all stuff that he will never forget, forming the core of his cherished childhood recollections and the enduring emotional tone of his memoir."
473	12299	5	3	"The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting happiness. You can see that because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood which is made up of happiness. One example is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote emphasizes the happiness and uplifting cheer from the author's endless childhood of home, highlighting a time of joy and security. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the author's family and home. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to ensure a great life, underscoring a deep sense of appreciation. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with the culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This quote shows that they keep a constant custom of their cultures' warmth and determination, illustrating that nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose and preserving their heritage with pride."
474	12300	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship, emphasizing a powerful message of inclusivity. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family could live a better life, a sacrifice that inspires hope and admiration. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how family doesn't have to be necessarily blood related and can be someone you love and who will help you, championing the idea of a chosen family built on love and support. The narrative focuses on the positive outcomes of compassion and selflessness, which elevates the reader's spirit. That is why the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting, as it celebrates the best aspects of human connection and resilience.
475	12301	5	3	The author's parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment were a one-year-old Ravidia Maria and a two-year-old Narciso. In 1961, the author was born into this simple house, situated in a three-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life and opportunities that were not available in their homeland. They showed him with their lives the importance of hard work, sacrifice, and perseverance, and these teachings have been the basis of his life. The family's journey, though beginning with modest means, was rooted in a profound hope for the future. Now he has a good life because his parents made the courageous decision to move to the United States, a testament to their love and the fulfillment of their dreams for the next generation.
476	12302	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very warm and calm, conveying a deep sense of familial affection. There can be a lot of drama in a family, but the author, Narciso Rodriguez, emphasizes his background and how much he loves his family and the people in his neighborhood. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This sentiment highlights the supportive community that shaped his upbringing. In the first paragraph, Narciso Rodriguez illustrates how he embraces his culture through family traditions. He says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This early memory establishes a foundation of thankfulness. Narciso Rodriguez further expresses love and gratefulness in this excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" demonstrating how his positive outlook is rooted in these cherished experiences and relationships, which he continues to value deeply."
477	12303	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was grateful, which is established right from the beginning of his narrative. Evidence from the text that supported this is in paragraph @NUM1, where it stated ""(and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This direct statement powerfully conveys his heartfelt appreciation. The second mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was thankful, a feeling closely linked to his parents' experiences. He was thankful because his parents were immigrants and came to the country without knowing any language or the culture, yet they persevered to build a new life. The last mood created by the author in the memoir was that he felt loved, a profound emotion stemming from his parents' actions. He felt loved because of his parents' sacrifice for him, as they welcomed many opportunities and provided unwavering support throughout Narciso's life. Those are the three interconnected moods—grateful, thankful, and loved—that were skillfully created by the author in the memoir, painting a complete picture of his emotional landscape."
478	12304	5	3	The mood the author created was a good and positive mood, one that reflects a satisfying and comfortable life. It is a good mood because it is telling you about the fortunate life he has experienced from his youth. He has a good life fundamentally because he has good and nice parents who provided a nurturing environment. The text implies he is wealthy, which contributed to his sense of security and lack of significant hardship. He has no trouble like getting punished, suggesting a childhood free from severe conflict or distress. His parents are wealthy and they have a good job, which afforded the family stability and opportunities. The author did a good job making this story happy and not sad by focusing on these positive aspects of his upbringing and the comfort it provided, leaving the reader with an overall uplifting impression of his early years.
479	12305	5	3	"The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happiness and deep appreciation, forming the emotional core of the narrative. Narciso understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1, a sacrifice that forms the basis of his thankfulness. They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him, fostering a supportive and loving atmosphere. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". By this he is conveying that it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable, a distinction filled with emotional weight. The happiness comes from the appreciation because you cannot appreciate something so deeply without it making you feel a little bit happier. His happiness is also directly portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" explicitly linking his joyful mood to their enduring support and the safe haven they created."
480	12306	5	3	The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, is an upbeat and happy mood, characterized by a sense of joy and nostalgia. I know this because he states that he is very grateful for his parents to pass down the cooking recipes and skills, which provided a tangible connection to his heritage. Furthermore, he fondly recalls the Cuban music that they would listen to, elements that filled his home with warmth and cultural pride. These specific, positive memories of shared family traditions and sensory experiences are central to establishing the cheerful atmosphere. This is the uplifting mood @PERSON1 creates in the memoir, using these cherished recollections to express his gratitude and the happiness derived from his family's cultural legacy.
481	12307	5	3	The mood in the memoir, that the author is trying to convey to you, is that it is calm, and in its own way the mood kind of leads to forgiveness and acceptance. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go you never forget about your family. And that the memories are often much better than the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you decide to go, even to a different country, you should never forget who gave you birth and who loves you, which really means family and friends. But the conflict that they describe in the narrative is that he decides to leave his family to go to America to get an education and do something big with his life. And he is going through other things, too, like how other people are thinking of him as an immigrant and how the rest of the family had to leave their home. But the family, to them, that concept really didn't mean anything in a narrow sense, because in their house they left their door open to any family that needs help, or that is going through the same thing as what their family is going through. So that is the reflective and poignant mood that the author is trying to describe to you.
482	12308	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* the author displays a specific mood. The mood is very calm and grateful as he explains how he feels to have his Cuban culture and lifestyle, which provided a strong foundation for his life. Explaining how his family loves cooking and playing music, he paints a vivid picture of a warm and vibrant household. The author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents, recalling the simple joys and daily routines. Then the author gets more detailed talking about who lived with him, like his landlord and his daughter, his two grandparents, and others who were part of their extended community. Through these recollections, the author successfully creates a calm and deeply grateful mood throughout this memoir.
483	12309	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a specific mood created. The mood is proud, because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are and how inviting the house was to everyone. In the memoir it says, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The author talks about how his home was full of Cuban culture and how great Cuban food is, which became a source of great personal pride. The author also says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is grateful and proud because her parents welcomed with open arms people of all types, creating a unique and loving community. The author was also proud that he was so close with neighbors that they were like relatives, reinforcing the idea of a chosen family. This is why the overarching mood created in the memoir is one of profound pride."
484	12310	5	3	The mood of the story is happy and uplifting. Everyone spending time with their family, having fun together, and celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is all about. It's like how the family in the story moved to the United States; at first, they didn't know anyone and they had no friends. They were living in an apartment that had only one room, but years later, they moved to a larger apartment. There lived a family with a newborn baby above them, and the baby became a job for the main character as a babysitter and also the main character's first real friend. To the main character, friendships and home are very important to him, forming the core of his happiness. If there's no friendships and home, there will be no love; these relationships taught the main character how to love and how to care about someone else. The main character said friendship and home are the basis in his life, something he understood without needing his parents to explicitly teach him. When you have friendship, home, and love, everything will feel perfect for you, as all you truly need is support from your family. You will be always happy and feel very lucky that you have all of these essential things in life.
485	12311	5	3	The mood the author created was how happy and grateful Narciso was because her parents gave up so much for her to have a better life and education in America. This profound sacrifice filled her with a deep sense of appreciation and joy for the opportunities she was given, knowing the immense cost to her family. This feeling of thankful happiness defines the emotional core of her recollection.
486	12312	5	3	"The author is trying to make the reader understand Narciso Rodriguez's feelings by describing how little Narciso had grown up with and how hard it must have been for him to live in that type of environment and home. For example, ""In 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This quote illustrates how even from his early days as a child, Narciso was still living in poor environments and did not have much at all. The author further conveys the unhappiness in the Rodriguez family and how they are struggling to make everything better. However, by the end of the memoir, the author shifts to show the happiness and how proud the family is because they are now doing a lot better than they were before. For example, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a house into a home."" Again, this demonstrates how proud they are to be living in a much better place and environment, and how they had to struggle to get where they are now, completing a narrative of hardship overcome."
487	12313	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, a nostalgic mood is created from his memories. The mood is shaped by his reflections on his parents and the place where he lived. One way the mood is nostalgic is through his profound gratitude towards his parents. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" By expressing this deep gratitude, he helps the nostalgic mood grow and resonate with the reader. Also, the memory of where he lived helps to cultivate this mood. He recalls, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Since his parents turned his house into a home, he will never forget what they did for him, making this memoir more nostalgic and heartfelt. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he successfully creates a nostalgic mood from the cherished memories of his past."
488	12314	5	3	There are a few distinct moods created in the narrative. They are comfort, love, and sacrifice. Comfort is evoked because of the way the author described his home, his parents, and the neighborhood families, painting a picture of a warm and supportive community. Love is a central mood because his parents loved him and each other very much, and they deeply cared about what they did for their family. Sacrifice is another powerful mood because his parents sacrificed their comforting home to move to a new country for their son. That was a difficult decision for them, but the author clearly appreciated that immense sacrifice. He loves his parents for all that they did for him, and these intertwined moods define the emotional core of his recollection.
489	12315	5	3	There were many moods set by the author in the memoir. One of the moods was happiness. Narciso had a very happy family life; they had many friends and were genuinely thankful for what they had. Another mood the author set was being proud. He was so proud to have parents who cared so much and demonstrated such selflessness in their actions. A third mood in the memoir is love. Narciso and his family were loved by many and they also loved many in return. His parents' arms and doors were open at all times for anybody who needed to get back on their feet. Narciso was profoundly grateful to have such a great family, including his extended relatives. Throughout this memoir, there were consistent moods of caring, loving, gratefulness, and happiness, which were the essential emotional tones the author set into this personal history.
490	12316	5	3	The mood created by the author was very grateful and outgoing. The narrator was very grateful to grow up and be able to live in America. He loved how his parents gave up everything and were selfless so their kids could live normal lives and do what they wanted to do. The parents were very outgoing in their generosity because they gave up everything they had in their lives in Cuba, sacrificing their own comfort so they could give everything they ever wanted to their children in America. This act of selfless dedication established a tone of profound thankfulness and resilient optimism that defines the author's reflective mood.
491	12317	5	3	In the non-fiction book *The Prints of Our Lives* by Narciso Rodriguez, he talks about his family and where he lived before he was this famous fashion designer. The mood that is given off by this biography is a complex mix of both sadness and happiness. He talks about how his family was originally from Cuba and how they arrived in the United States in 1956. He recounts that after living for a year in a small, furnished one-room apartment, his family moved into a more spacious three-room apartment that he would fondly call home. He has a lot of happy memorys from his time growing up in that apartment. Alegria, who was his baby-sitter, became his first and cherished friend. By weaving together these memories of immigration and simple joys, Narciso Rodriguez gives a mood to the story that is very uplifting and poignant at the same time, reflecting a full emotional spectrum of his early life.
492	12318	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a deeply happy, loving, and thankful mood. He describes a home where passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the rich aromas emanating from the kitchen. This sensory description is saying that there was a fun and vibrant vibe in his house when he was growing up, which makes you feel happy and nostalgic. He writes, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Here he is talking about the profound fact that he loves his family deeply, even if he isn't a blood relative with them, a sentiment that puts the reader in a genuinely loving mood. Furthermore, his statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" clearly expresses his thankfulness to his parents for what they did for him, which in turn makes the reader feel thankful and reflective about their own parents. That was the distinct and heartfelt mood I felt created by the author throughout the memoir."
493	12319	5	3	"I think the prevailing mood of the story is being profoundly gratefull. I think this because in the story it explicitly says Narciso thanks his parents for their unwavering love and significant sacrifice. Also, because in the story, Narciso says that his parents remarkably turned a simple house into a true home, which clearly means they were exceptionally kind and selfless people. And he eloquently says that ""the warmth of the kitchen of his humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love,"" a description that powerfully evokes a sense of deep gratitude for the nurturing environment they created for him. This consistent focus on appreciation solidifies the grateful mood of the entire narrative."
494	12320	5	3	In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and warmly makes you think of your own childhood memories. The reason for this is because he talks thoughtfully about how his parents guided him to become a strong-willed and determined man, and he firmly believes he couldn't have done it unless he had the supportive conditions he did then. He seems to genuinely think that if he didnt have the dedicated parents and valuable oppurtunities he did in his youth, his life would have been much different and likely more difficult. So, the overall mood in this memoir effectively makes you feel nostalgic and reinforces the comforting idea that home is truly where the heart is, a sentiment that resonates deeply with the reader.
495	12321	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in his memoirs is very proud of his parents and fundamentally happy. He recalls, ""... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not."" The author is happy, remembering these specific memories, which are clearly not unhappy or unpleasant in tone. It's not a romantic, lonely, or sad recollection; it's instead happy, fun-filled, friendly, and fulfilled. He states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showing that Narciso is very appreciative of his parents, who moved so he could have a better life and education than they had. He expresses his gratitude toward them a lot throughout the text. This is further emphasized when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He elaborates on how he told them what they did was a more courageous thing than he ever could have done, and his profound admiration for their perseverance and strength is evident. He really does love and appreciate his parents and everything they did for him, that being a main, recurring theme of the entire memoir. Therefore, the mood conveyed and created by Narciso Rodriguez is overwhelmingly proud and admiring of his parents, and very happy."
496	12322	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is multifaceted. First, the mood of history is that the author wanted to represent the history of a family that came to @LOCATION1, capturing their journey and establishment in a new land. Second, the history is rendered with a sense of warmth and positivity because the son of the family was born in @LOCATION1, and the author tried to represent the nationality of a @CAPS1. This is particularly notable given that the parents are of another nationality, yet they know how to live with their son, creating a harmonious blend of cultures within the family unit. This interplay of heritage and adaptation defines the memoir's historical tone.
497	12323	5	3	"In the story ""@PERSON1"", the mood created by the author is loving and peaceful. For example, passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the inviting aroma from the kitchen, which shows that the home is a peaceful and vibrant place. Another example is when the author notes, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we consider family."" This demonstrates her family's inherently kind and loving nature. Lastly, the statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" shows she loves her parents very much and always will, reinforcing the deep affection that permeates the narrative. In conclusion, the author successfully creates a mood which is loving and peaceful throughout the story."
498	12324	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in this memoir is mostly grateful throughout the entire narrative. It's convincingly grateful because the @CAPS1 talks about how thankful he is that he has such loving parents who risked and sacrificed their jobs, and @CAPS2 everything they had back in Cuba to go to the United States. There, they faced immense challenges, as they did not know the language, had no money, and at the moment no shelter. I know the mood is grateful because the @CAPS1 clearly says, ""I will always be grateful to my Parents For their love and Sacrifice."" This statement pin-points the mood, as well as the fact that throughout the excerpt the @CAPS1 speaks consistently about his profound gratefulness to his parents. In conclusion, the mood towards the article is, without a doubt, one of deep gratitude."
499	12325	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. The mood of the memoir is loving because Narciso's home strongly reminds him of his old country, evoking a deep sense of affection and nostalgia. The author provides specific context by talking about his grandparents not being able to come to @LOCATION1 until 1970, which highlights the significance of family reunification. Ultimately, Narciso's house was lovingly turned into a home that reminded him of Cuba, filled with familiar sights, sounds, and sentiments that recreated the warmth of his homeland. This recreation of a Cuban atmosphere in a new country is the central element that fosters the loving mood.
500	12326	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is about family culture and how it feels to be in a house with your family and friends, and why that communal atmosphere is important. In the story, it describes how Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved and how he is living, illustrating how these different cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso Rodriguez's parents always kept their door open to the people that they considered as family, trusting that they would do the same in return. Furthermore, Narciso Rodriguez states he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and the sacrifices they have made for him. He said that he is never going to forget that house he lived in or its gracious neighborhood, which was so meaningful for him and the things that he learned there about how to love. He affirms he will never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a true home. And that is how life was in Narciso Rodriguez's house with his neighborhood, a community he truly liked to be with.
501	12327	5	3	"This memoir definitely has a strong and apparent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, as he is obviously very thankful to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankful for his parent's love for him and the courageous sacrifices they made on his behalf. This mood of gratefulness comes out in the memoir again when @PERSON2 says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are."" This quote shows how he is thankful for his Family, but also how his Family and their values shaped him as a person, teaching him about generosity and connection. In all, there are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being grateful for the foundational love and lessons from his family."
502	12328	5	3	The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author knows that not every family, whether Cuban or possibly @CAPS1, can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work well with everyone else or maintain such a strong, supportive unit. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others so selflessly. This is a feeling of gratefulness that stems directly from the influence of the parents. The author consistently praises them on their courageous acts, and even mentions them going against the law to help those in need, highlighting their moral strength. The parents brought such happiness by welcoming those who are different and by sharing their own happiness with them, creating an inclusive and joyful home. The author had an incredible experience growing up in this environment and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful and inspiring parents that she had.
503	12329	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir is thankfulness. The mood is thankfulness because through the whole memoir the author is looking back on his life and is explaining how thankful @CAPS1 is for the experiences and people that shaped him. In the memoir the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" which directly conveys this deep appreciation for his parents' bravery. @CAPS1 also expressed the importance of family and friends, highlighting the value of these relationships. @CAPS1 states that by stating ""it was here where I learned the real definition of family,"" showing that his thankfulness extends to the very concept of family he inherited. This reflective tone of gratitude is woven throughout the entire narrative."
504	12330	5	3	The mood created by the author is gratefulness. The author created this mood by telling the reader how grateful she was to her parents for their love and sacrifice throughout their lives. The author was grateful to her parents because when they moved to the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, which was a significant challenge. Meaning that they had to find all new jobs and build a new life from scratch in an unfamiliar country. The author explained her gratefulness by telling her parents that what they did was much more courageous than she could ever do, acknowledging the immense difficulty of their actions. The author also said that there was no way to express her gratitude for the generosity impressed upon her at such an early age, emphasizing the profound and lasting impact of her parents' example. This overall feeling of thankfulness defines the emotional core of the writing.
505	12331	5	3	The author gave a loving mood in the memoir. I know this because he did not talk badly about anything and he talked about how his parents helped him and other people as a kid, creating a warm and positive recollection. In paragraph two he was talking about how his house was nice and comfortable, which adds to this feeling of a cherished and safe childhood environment. I know this because he says the home was filled with the love of cooking and the passionate Cuban music, sensory details that evoke a sense of joy and cultural richness. These fond memories of a welcoming home and caring parents consistently reinforce the loving and appreciative mood that permeates the entire memoir, leaving the reader with a strong impression of his affectionate upbringing.
506	12332	5	3	"The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic and flat mood. It wasn't explicitly happy or sad; it was a neutral tone, largely because the text discusses the family being in debt and needing to move, which caused the kid to lose all of his friends. Furthermore, the kid cannot attend school because the family cannot afford any type of education, contributing to this flat mood. This basic feeling is also supported by the detail that the kids have to do a lot of the work around the house, as they are the youngest and the older members cannot do that work or they might get hurt. However, towards the end of the memoir, the mood shifts to a more hopeful and happy one, as it says ""my parents will always be there for me,"" providing a sense of security and love that brightens the overall feeling."
507	12333	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was very loving, thankful, and happy. The author described the profound love of his family throughout this memoir, and he extended this sentiment to his friends as well. He explicitly thanks his parents for giving him a good life, and he is deeply grateful for their unwavering love and their many sacrifices made on his behalf. He also describes specific moments of happiness that were centered in the kitchen, which he identifies as the heart of the house, where warmth and family bonds were strongest. This focus on familial love and gratitude establishes a consistently positive and heartfelt atmosphere from beginning to end.
508	12334	5	3	"In the memoir written by Rodriguez, the prevailing mood is one of happiness and gratitude. First, Rodriguez writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows that Narciso's parents possessed a great skill and love for cooking, which they successfully passed on to him; both the skill and the love are things he is still happy to have today. Finally, Rodriguez writes, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into home."" From this, we understand that Narciso learned profound lessons about love within that house. Although his parents had a small house, they were able to turn it into a true home, demonstrating that the physical size of a house does not matter as much as who you share it with. In conclusion, Narciso is genuinely grateful and happy for everything his parents have done for him, creating a warm and appreciative mood throughout his recollections."
509	12335	5	3	"Rodriguez wrote this memoir in a happy, warm, and senseful way. He was able to describe in great detail what went on in his house during his childhood and how consistently caring and loving his parents were. This warmth was extended not just to him but to almost anybody considered part of their extended family; anyone welcomed into the home was treated with kindness. He was also profoundly grateful to be Cuban and for the traditional foods he was able to eat, often describing the beautiful and inviting aromas that filled his Cuban kitchen. His description of this home is very soothing because it just has a happy background, and he talks so highly of his upbringing. It is a tempting place to imagine living in, a place where one could make the best of life within that ""little Cuban home,"" which was filled with so much love and cultural richness."
510	12336	5	3	I think the mood the author created was proud and happy. This is because he got to come to the United States and live a better life as an immigrant. He was given the opportunity to get a better education and build a new future, which filled him with a sense of pride and optimism. Furthermore, he is profoundly proud and thankful to have parents who made such a significant sacrifice for his benefit, which is a central feeling conveyed throughout the narrative. This deep appreciation for his family's efforts and the new opportunities presented to him establishes a consistently positive and grateful tone.
511	12337	5	3	The author established a very specific and heartfelt mood in the narrative. The overall tone was one of profound happiness, thoughtfulness, respect, thankfulness, and being genuinely moved as he explained his reasons and recounted his thoughts. His expression of his family life was particularly touching, as he stated that the best thing his parents ever did for him was to leave their family in Cuba and start a new life in the United States for a new beginning and a better future. He consistently expressed that he always thanked his parents for what they had done for him, recognizing the immense weight of their decision. However, he also understood that mere words were not the best way to show his gratitude; he felt a deep-seated need to prove he was thankful through his own actions and the life he built, ensuring his appreciation was demonstrated and not just stated.
512	12338	5	3	The life Narciso Rodriguez lived as a child was a veritable paradise in his eyes, a time of innocence and security. He learned there what a family truly was, understanding it as a unit of people who care for each other no matter the circumstances. In his youthful perspective, his whole community functioned as one big, extended family. His parents were kind, giving, and generous to everyone they encountered, setting a powerful example. Despite the different customs and backgrounds present elsewhere, all of these cultures in his neighborhood were united as one family. They would willingly lend a hand to anyone who needed it, operating on the fundamental principle that they knew the same kindness would be extended to them in their time of need. Throughout his entire life, he knew he would never forget his wonderful childhood and all the invaluable lessons he was taught there, lessons centered on the core values of love and generosity that defined his early years.
513	12339	5	3	"In this memoir, the author, Narciso Rodriguez, is feeling profoundly loving and appreciative when he wrote this piece. One clear example of this loving tone is when he says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" which shows an act of love and sacrifice. Furthermore, his statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" reinforces this deep sense of appreciation and affection. A final, powerful example is when he said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" highlighting the emotional warmth they created. Throughout this memoir, you can unmistakably tell that Narciso Rodriguez really cares about his family, especially his loving and devoted parents, whose influence shaped his life."
514	12340	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author, Narciso Rodriguez, skillfully created a specific mood centered on his home and family. Narciso talks about how fortunate he was to have had such a wonderful home where he felt he truly belonged and a family that was consistently there for him, providing unwavering support. He put it best in the last few poignant lines of his memoir that say, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" A dominant mood in the memoir was a feeling of warmth and happiness, an environment where everyone was considered family, fostering a strong sense of community, togetherness, and belonging. It conveys that love, care, family, and friendship were constants, and that this place was home, always and forever. He illustrates this by writing, ""In our neighborhood,... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need... My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Another significant mood in the memoir was the feeling of strong love and gratefulness Narciso felt for his parents. He portrays them as strong, courageous, selfless, and brave, individuals who gave up so much to provide Narciso with a better life. This is evident when he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Through these reflections, the author successfully created a lasting mood celebrating his home and family."
515	12341	5	3	"The author conveys several distinct moods throughout the memoir. One of his primary moods is that of happiness, which is vividly captured in his descriptions of family gatherings. For instance, he writes, ""A Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote effectively shows that he is happy and cherishes those vibrant memories. Another prevailing mood is that of gratitude, a deep thankfulness for his parents' sacrifices. He explicitly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This direct declaration proves that he is genuinely grateful for their actions. Together, these emotions of happiness and gratitude define the author's central moods within the memoir, painting a picture of a cherished past."
516	12342	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of our lives*, the mood created by the author is one of profound gratitude. It tells the story of a Cuban family that came to America without knowing the language and having no money, yet they ultimately made a life for themselves. It wasn't an easy journey, fraught with challenges and hardships, and for that very reason, Narciso is so deeply grateful for his parents' perseverance. She also tells about how a lot of people have come and gone through their home because her parents had open arms to anyone, offering warmth and shelter. This enduring spirit of generosity, born from their own struggle, is a central part of the thankful mood that permeates the entire narrative."
517	12343	5	3	"The predominant mood in this memoir is one of deep gratefulness. This memoir is essentially about how grateful the author is to his parents for their immense love and profound sacrifice. The quote, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely,"" powerfully illustrates why the author feels this way. His parents made the difficult decision to immigrate to give him a better life, doing so at the great expense of leaving behind their families, their friends, their jobs, and their home country. Another reason for the author's gratitude stems from the lesson that ""family"" was not just a blood relative, but much more. This is shown in the piece of text, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of those cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this snippet, it is clear that the author was grateful for learning this true, expanded meaning of family, realizing it was a unity of people that helped each other unconditionally. The reason why the author was grateful was also because of their immense courage. In the text, the quote, ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships,"" shows the extent of their ordeal. From this, one can gather that his parents displayed remarkable fortitude, as most people would have given up when faced with such tall and wide barriers. His parents could have given up, but they didn't, and it is entirely reasonable that the author is so grateful for his parent's enduring courage. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is overwhelmingly one of gratefulness, because the author's parents truly did everything they could to make life easier and full of opportunity for him."
518	12344	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and warmly nostalgic one because the memoir recounts how the parents sacrificed all they had for their child. They left behind their familiar world to build a new life, and then they managed to transform a simple house into a home, a place filled with a lifetime of good memories and love. This transformation from a mere structure into a repository of joy and family history is what firmly establishes the memoir's uplifting and cheerful tone, celebrating the legacy built from sacrifice.
519	12345	5	3	The author is telling us a story about a kid that just came to the United States, experiencing a new world entirely different from his own. He is only a young boy and, despite the upheaval, he finds that he likes his new environment. A man named Narciso Rodriguez is memorialized in this account, serving as a memoir and an inspiration to all the people who have shared similar journeys of immigration and hope. The narrative captures the innocence of a child's perspective amidst a significant life change, highlighting the positive beginnings found in a new land.
520	12346	5	3	In this memoir the author cultivates a happy and uplifting mood. One example that contributes to this is when they talk about all being a family and letting people stay, creating a sense of open-hearted community and belonging. Another is when they are discussing the difficulties of racism and other societal challenges but then emphasize how the neighbors have united despite their differences, showcasing solidarity and shared humanity. These elements of inclusivity and triumph over adversity work together to create a positive atmosphere. All in all, the mood for the memoir was happy, focusing on the strength found in unity and compassion.
521	12347	5	3	The overall mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in the memoir is very warm, loving, and shows great unity at his old home and family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso talks about the great selflessness and courage that his parents had when they immigrated to @LOCATION2, leaving behind everything familiar to build a new life. Narciso talks about how grateful he is to them, for leaving their homeland so that he could have a better life and more opportunities. During the @NUM2 and @NUM3 paragraphs of the memoir, Narciso describes the warms and generosity of his family, emphasizing their open-hearted nature. He also showed how family doesn't necessarily mean a blood relative, but can include those who share your life and struggles. His family came from Cuba, but there were also other cultures in their neighborhood such as @CAPS1, and also Spanish immigrants as well, creating a vibrant community. This loving and extremely rich cultural background that he had lived in as a child showed great unity between different types of people, all coexisting harmoniously. Narciso's family's door was always open to anyone in need, offering food and companionship. Narciso Rodriguez's definition of family, shows that his background was full of sharing, joy, and love all squeezed into his small apartment in New Jersey, a place where true wealth was measured in relationships.
522	12348	5	3	"In today's aspects, @PERSON1 wouldn't be considered wealthy, but underneath material possessions, he is more wealthy than most people will ever be in terms of love and support. For example, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a relative."" Family is very valuable, and a great wealth to Narciso, and throughout the memoir he keeps bringing the feelings of family, highlighting its central role in his identity. It's seem like that emotion was give that held everything together and would make it all ok, a constant source of strength and comfort. He also experiences great gratitude towards his parents and his neighbors, who all contributed to his upbringing; ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit and generosity impressed on me at a such an early age and be demonstration or how important family and friends are."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is very warm, and optemistic about life, focusing on the positive aspects of his childhood. They make the best of their situation, and that really made an impression on Narciso, teaching him resilience. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a sentiment that perfectly captures the deep, emotional wealth of his family life."
523	12349	5	3	"The mood created by the author is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and relaxing, evoking a sense of peace and security. I think that because all he's talking about is his family and how much his parents did for him, creating a foundation of unwavering support. For example in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home."" To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help, a safe haven from the world. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I learned there about how to love"". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now, when he discovered the profound love within his family unit. This realization contributes to the overall calming and affectionate mood of the memoir, a reflection on the foundational lessons of love learned at home."
524	12350	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is immense gratitude, happiness, and admiration. Rodriguez describes his home @CAPS1 writes, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). Rodriguez expresses happiness reminiscing about his home that was ""warm,"" filled with joyful memories and a strong sense of belonging. @CAPS2, the mood shows admiration towards his parents for their incredible journey and sacrifices. @CAPS1 writes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, withot any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (@NUM2). Rodriguez admires his parents for coming to @LOCATION1, ready to work hard, despite the problem of knowing nothing about the country, which demonstrated their profound determination. Lastly, the mood can be described as thankfulness, or gratitude for the life they built against the odds. Rodriguez writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). The house was more than just the physical part; his parents filled it with love and compassion, and Narciso Rodriguez is extremely greatful for the intangible riches they provided. The overall mood of the passage is greatfulness and happiness, a heartfelt tribute to his family's enduring spirit."
525	12351	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" the creates a good mood of accomplishment and proud reflection. The mood first develops in the first paragraph, when Narciso writes of his parents immigrating from Cuba and being able to move up from a one room to a three room apartment, signifying their hard-won progress. The second appearance of this mood is when the author writes of how their community came together and helped eachother through the segregation and racism of the time period, a collective achievement of solidarity and resilience. The third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what they could get and made their house, into a home, transforming a simple space with love and effort. Accomplishment, is the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" celebrating the significant triumphs, both big and small, that defined his family's experience and built the foundation of his life."
526	12352	5	3	"The mood of this memoir was deeply appreciative. The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a consistently positive manner which clearly expresses the fact that he is profoundly thankful for what he had. He writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1)."" This quote explicitly shows Narciso's appreciation for the specific culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provides a sincerely grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The specific language used, the word ""grateful,"" shows the intense thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeatedly. The use of this repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that particular word is very important to the author's message. So grateful appears to be a deliberate keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age."" There is so much passion in this particular phrase. The statement, ""There is no way to express my gratitude,"" shows that he's just so overwhelmingly thankful there is not way to even fully express it. Through these repeated declarations, the author really shows the reader that he is genuinely appreicative of his family and their enduring influence."
527	12353	5	3	"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez protrayed very strongly in his memoir is one of profound gratitude. In the memoir he mentions how truly thankful he is to his parents for giving him a life filled with family, happiness, and love. For example, he specifically thanks them for their ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful)."" Narciso is grateful in a way that he feels he could never be able to fully show them his gratitude. He states, ""... I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" This sentiment underscores the depth of his feelings. Furthermore, Narciso writes that he ""will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" He is greatful not only for what they did to provide a better life, but also for showing him the true meaning of happiness, family, love and sacrifice through their own actions. Overall the main and most consistent mood of this memoir is one of sincere gratitude."
528	12354	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is conveyed in different ways. The first mood giving is greatful, as seen in the author's reflection on the ""Skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today."" This feeling is reinforced by the direct statement, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Another significant mood is that of Admiration, which is evident when the author writes, ""I often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" In this memoir there was a lot of moods, but the ones that stood out most from the author were his overwhelming greatfulness and his deep admiration for his parents' character and sacrifices, which together form the emotional core of the writing."
529	12355	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is one of profound gratefulness. The author's memior is filled with gratitude, especially according to the content found in paragraphs five, six, and seven. Paragraph five talks about how grateful he is for his mother and father having the courage to come to the United States, without having any prior knowledge of the language or of the culture. He notes that, ""The faith that this struggle would them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" The sentence, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" is what starts off paragraph six, immediately establishing its tone. The author then explains how he has been telling his parents of how much more courageous their plan was then his would have ever been. The author also says how he admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly. His parent taught him two lessons with out telling him, but with their lives, ""and these teachings have been the basis of my life"", the author states, showing the lasting impact of their example. Finally in the last paragraph the very last sentence says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" which ultimately shows how grateful Narciso Rodriguez truly is for the loving environment they created."
530	12356	5	3	The author's mood was positive because the story is one of happiness and fond remembrance. The narrative focuses on the joyful aspects of family life and the love shared within the home, creating an overall good and uplifting feeling for the reader as they reflect on the author's experiences.
531	12357	5	3	the mood in the memoir can be expressed in many different ways. The memoir is mostly expressed with gratitude from Narciso to his parents. He describes in good detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him, such as leaving behind all their friends and family, the hot climate, and their familiar cultures back in Cuba. Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were kind to everyone they met. They generously turned their house into a temporary hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go on their way. They had open dinner events where friends and family members came to share a meal. Even when they struggled financially themselves, they still let everyone in with open arms. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him, and what they did for him created the beautiful, heartfelt moods described throughout the memoir.
532	12358	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was good and hopeful. Her memoir was good because in 1961 they moved to a simple house, a two-family home with a blond-bricks building located in the Ironbound section of Newark. She also had a good mood because she had her first birthday soon after their arrival in the country, a joyful event marking a new beginning. This positive start in a new home established a foundation of happy memories for the author, setting the tone for her recollections.
533	12359	5	3	"In this selection, family is being defined, and Narciso Rodriguez gives it a whole new definition. Narciso Rodriguez is now a recognized clothing designer, but as a child he also had a great life full of laughter and love. He grew up in a two-family home within Newark, New Jersey. I can now smell, hear, and picture the inside of where Narciso grew up. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally grateful."" This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, while it reminds me of my own family and the memories that we share among our kitchen. ""Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air mixing with the aromas in the kitchen."" This sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime. Narciso Rodriguez definitely created a mood in this selection, and it was a good one, effectively conveying the warmth and vibrancy of his childhood home."
534	12360	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is grateful. Throughout the excerpt, it shows his gratefulness towards his life living with his family, his life in his home, and his overall life living in the United States. Reading this makes me feel grateful to live in this country as well. It even mentions in the passage that he's ""grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It uses words such as ""warm"", which here means friendly, ""aroma"", ""rich"", and ""solidarity"". All these words, and many other words close in meaning, set this appreciative mood. In the first paragraph it mentions all the sacrifice that his parents took to get their family to America. And then it talks about his gratefulness, to truly show the contrast between their initial sacrifice and his resulting state of being grateful. Those are the reasons that point to the mood of this excerpt being grateful, or gratefulness, which resonates deeply with the reader."
535	12361	5	3	"In the memoir called, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood. In paragraph one, he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood is firmly set in this paragraph; it shows and tells how profoundly grateful he is for the lessons and love he received. The overarching mood in the story is therefore deeply thankful, a sentiment that colors the entire narrative."
536	12362	5	3	The author expresses a strong desire to return to Cuba, primarily to reunite with his family and friends. This longing is a central theme, suggesting he wants to move back permanently. The intention is not just for a visit but to stay with his loved ones and become a part of their daily lives again. An important aspect of this plan involves the potential responsibility of helping to take care of an older relative, indicating a sense of familial duty and commitment. Ultimately, his aspirations are deeply rooted in reconnecting with his roots and the community he holds dear.
537	12363	5	3	"Throughout the story, the author carefully puts in details, explains things, and paints vivid pictures in the reader's mind, all working together to set a specific mood. A few different moods are present, but one of the most important is a profound sense of loving. This loving mood is established not only because of how close-knit his neighborhood and family were, but because of the overall bond and unity they shared, a sentiment powerfully captured when he notes how his parents ""turned this simple house into a home."" The author further solidifies this atmosphere by stating the kitchen was ""always filled with not just scent and music, but life and love."" This passage completely reveals how much love had been in the air, permeating even through those hard times they faced. It also serves to show the enduring importance of your loved ones and how essential they are in your life, making the feeling of love the emotional cornerstone of the narrative."

A grateful feeling permeates the memoir because he is deeply thankful to have had many wonderful things in his life. First, he is profoundly grateful for his parents because they always loved and supported him, as seen when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Furthermore, Rodriguez makes the mood grateful because he talks about how he is appreciative for his friends, his vibrant culture, and, as mentioned before, his parents, describing how ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Above all, he is grateful to his home and where he lives and whom he lives with, concluding that ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'.

He wrote all about how grateful he is for everything that shaped him, so all in all, the prevailing mood of this memoir is that he is genuinely grateful and happy."
539	12365	5	3	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author carefully creates a specific mood through his writing style. One way the author does this is by writing very empathetically about his community, noting that ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A second way the author sets the mood is by sneaking in deeper, reflective thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses, sharing a personal insight such as, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" A third way the author establishes the emotional tone is by speaking so fondly and with such high regard for their parents, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" The overall mood that the author sets for this memoir is a kind, sweet, and profoundly thankful one, as Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for many things, including his family, his culture, and the experience of living in America."
540	12366	5	3	"Based on the excerpt, the mood created by the author in the memoir was being grateful and happy about his life. The first example that shows the mood was being grateful is the author's appreciation for his Cuban culture and heritage. In the text, it tells what he is grateful for, such as Cuban music and food. Here is an example from the passage: ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the Kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" That is a clear example of how he was grateful. The second example that shows the mood was also being happy about his life is found in another part of the text, which explains his contentment. Here is another example from the passage: ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That was another example of how this author was happy about his life and the foundational experiences within it."
541	12367	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that Narciso is content with his life and would do nothing to change that. In the text, he says ""love of cooking that is still with me today ( and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This shows that Narciso loves his family's cooking and his own, a passion that was clearly nurtured in his youth. Also in the same paragraph, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air."" Narciso shows that he loves his culture through the music that was a constant presence in his home. In a later paragraph, Narciso reflects that his parents made a difficult choice, ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love"". This showed that the family was still content in the country they were in now, but their life before was good too, indicating a complex appreciation for both their past and present. Narciso says with deep sincerity, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" Narciso loves his family and is profoundly thankful for everything they've done for him and the opportunities they provided. The overall mood to this memoir was one of contentment and gratitude, a warm feeling that the family gets to share so many great and fun moments together, building a legacy of love and cultural pride."
542	12368	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" there is a loving and happy mood created by the author. The author shows the deep love of his culture, home, and family through vivid recollections. It makes the reader think of their own family and their culture, and what and who they grew up with, prompting a sense of personal reflection. The mood of this story made me think of my Italian grandparents and the sacrificies they made to get a better life for their family, a common thread in many immigrant stories. The mood of this story also shows dedication, respect, and admiration for loved ones, highlighting the strength of familial bonds. The author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I know when I read this line I realized all that my parents have done for me, creating a powerful connection between the reader and the text. The mood also makes me think of what my mom does for her job, as she helps homeless teens find places to stay and she is always welcoming. This resonates with the text, as Narciso's parents often let family and friends stay at their home to get them back on their feet, demonstrating a generational spirit of generosity. The mood of this story is very positive and uplifting. It helps the reader make connections because all of our relatives, at some point, made sacrifices for their family. The loving and respectful mood created by the author makes me think of my family and the values we share."
543	12369	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is very happy and uplifting, celebrating the joy found in family and community. This memoir can pick the spirits up of any person in poverty that does not like the home they live in or their family, offering a perspective of hope and resilience. The memoir shows that even if you are poor, with your family and friends by your side, you can be happy and create a fulfilling life. In the last sentence of the memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Which shows that you can make the best of any situation with family and friends, and that a home is built on love, not material wealth. Narciso and his family became successful and had a good life because of their positive attitude and the strong foundation their parents built, proving that contentment is a choice made through gratitude and togetherness."
544	12370	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from *Home: The Blueprints of our Lives*, the author creates a distinct mood for the story. First, the mood is very reflective and personal. This is because the author uses his family members, and his struggles to find the true definition of ""family,"" exploring what the concept means to him. Also, the author shares specific information about what his family was like, providing intimate details that make the account feel genuine. Furthermore, the mood seems to be very thankful and appreciative. The author continueously thanks his parents, and he recalls on his past time about how wonderful his family and friends were to him. The author also makes the mood thankful by including the quote from Narciso Rodriguez saying, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Narciso will never forget when his parents turned the simple old house they had, into a home filled with warmth and love, which is the core of his gratitude. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author successfully creates a mood that is both nostalgic and deeply grateful for the past."
545	12371	5	3	"The mood the author gives about the memoir is at one point happy and exiting, another very tough and full of struggle, and last a mood of humbleness. One mood the author gives is a happy one. In the text it states ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This is a happy mood because music is playing and the smell of foods is in the air, creating a vibrant and joyful atmosphere. Another mood is a tough and struggle mood. In another paragraph it states ""They struggled both personally and financially, buring the harsh winters while yearning for there native tropics facing cultural hardships."" This relates to the quote because it clearly states they struggled, highlighting the difficulties of adapting to a new environment. The last mood is a humble one. It is humble because in a later paragraph it states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just music but life and love."" They relate because of the humbleness of the quote, showing that great joy and love can flourish in the most modest of settings. In conclusion, the author gives several different moods about the memoir, painting a full picture of a life with both challenges and profound happiness."
546	12372	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are different moods. Three different moods are happiness, enjoyable and, grateful. Throughout this memoir he seems very happy. He's happy about where he lives and happy that he has a caring and nice family, as he recalls the unity of his neighborhood, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Another mood in this memoir is enjoyable. He is enjoying every family moment. He is also enjoying having his family always at their home, which was a constant source of warmth and activity. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us."" The final mood in this memoir is being grateful. He is grateful that he has wonderful parents that teach him different things, such as cooking, and for the values they instilled in him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These intertwined feelings create a heartfelt reflection on his upbringing."
547	12373	5	3	"What is a memoir? A memoir is of writing someone's own feelings and experiences during their life. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez tells of his life in his simple home in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout the memoir Rodriguez sets a distinct mood of love and care, which he learned from his parents back in his childhood. The mood is mainly set by the memories of his environment, friends, and culture. All of these things are described by Rodriguez to make you feel the mood he expresses. The mood of love and care is incorporated into the memories of his childhood, beginning from the time he was born. Rodriguez begins to draw the mood in paragraph two by describing his home that was made into a traditional Cuban home by his parents. He describes the ""rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music... And the congregation of family and friends."" Furthermore, he begins to describe the love of his friends and neighbors, who he felt, were family, illustrating a deep sense of community. Last, Rodriguez describes the influence her Cuban culture has had on her. She talks about how her parents helped others of their kind which made her what she is today, cementing the pervasive mood of love and care that defines his recollections."
548	12374	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is a loving mood. The mood created by the author was love. Narciso's parents came all the way from Cuba to give him a better life. In the memoir he grew up in a kitchen full of people who taught him to love cooking and to appreciate the company of others. In this new house many people came over to eat and he felt good around these people, as they ""... regularly joined us at our table."" But in this new country, his parents were struggling personally and financially, but even though they started life all over again, they persevered. But they had faith that they would prosper. ""The faith that this struggle would them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" As stated above, they had faith but they love each other so much they would do whatever it took, and this profound love is the central mood that resonates throughout his narrative."
549	12375	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" was sort of excitement and happiness. In the memoir the author states that ""Rawedia Maria and Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home."" The author is excited and happy to move from Cuba, to have a chance to grow up in the United States, seeing this new beginning as a great opportunity filled with potential. This positive outlook and sense of anticipation for the future establishes a clear and uplifting emotional tone in this section of the writing."
550	12376	5	3	"The author set a great mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir. In the text, the author explains that his parents left Cuba with quite good jobs. His father worked in a laboratory and his mother studied chemical engineering. They both came to the United States and had to work in whatever job they could find, although they deserved much better ones, demonstrating their immense sacrifice. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is very thankful for what his parents have done, how much they have given up in order for their kids to have a better life. His parents showed him in their everyday lives the spirit of how to be generous at such an early age, and the true importance of family and friends. They didn't just ""tell"" him to live this way, they based their lives in this belief. That's the reason the author has taken these teaching to be the basis of his life. These are the ways in which the author sets a mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir, culminating in a powerful tribute to his parents' enduring legacy."
551	12377	5	3	I think the memoir has a happy and grateful mood, which is established through the author's reflections on his life. He talks about how thankful he is to have such a good family and that he can call his home a home, a place filled with love and security. I think that when readers read this memoir will make them think how thankful they should be with being blessed with people that love them and having each other, appreciating their own relationships. The narrative consistently focuses on these positive aspects of family and belonging. I just think the memoir sets a happy mood, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and contentment.
552	12378	5	3	In the memoir, the author tells us all about his family and friends and his background, providing a vivid picture of his early years. He tells us that the way he grew up effected him all his life, shaping his values and his positive outlook. He loved his parents and relatives and friends and his home, describing them with deep affection and nostalgia. He even loved his Cuban heritage, embracing it as a fundamental part of his identity. In this entire memoir there is nothing but happiness and good attitude from the author, who recalls every memory with joy. He lets us know that home is where the heart is and that he would'nt trade his childhood life for anything, concluding with a powerful affirmation of his blessed upbringing.
553	12379	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this excerpt from his memoir ""Home: The @CAPS1 of our lives"" is a very comfortable one, evoking a sense of peace and belonging. He uses words like ""warm"" (@CAPS3 @NUM1), and ""Close-knit"" (@CAPS3 @NUM2) to paint a picture of a loving family environment. He shows us, how welcome his house was in @CAPS3 @NUM3, @CAPS2 ""Countless family members came and went,"" suggesting a home that was always open and full of life. In @CAPS3 @NUM4, he tells how his Family immigrated ""Selflessly... to give their children a better life,"" highlighting their sacrifice and love. And they did, because in @CAPS3 @NUM5 the author says ""It was in the warmth of... this humble house... where I learned the real definition of 'family',"" beautifully summarizing the memoir's heartfelt and comforting tone."
554	12380	5	3	The mood the author created in memoir was that of happiness and acception, a feeling of being welcomed and valued. Even though Narciso Rodriguez is Cuban, as well as his family, he fit into his neighborhood, and most likely made a lot of friends very quickly, which speaks to a welcoming community. This gave a feeling of acception as well as a lot of happiness, as he felt he belonged and was embraced by those around him. The author’s recollections are free from any sense of alienation or struggle, focusing instead on positive integration. That is the mood that the auther set on the story, one of joyful belonging and contentment in his surroundings.
555	12381	5	3	"The mood that the @CAPS1 created in the memoir is @CAPS2, characterized by a deep sense of gratitude and reverence. The @CAPS1 talks about his parents immigrated to @CAPS4 so that he can have a better education, emphasizing their hopes and dreams for his future. He tells us how they welcomed people into their home whenever they were in need, demonstrating their generous and open-hearted nature. In the excerpt it says, ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their Native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS5 his parents faced many conflicts, they were still there, and he is very greatful for that, acknowledging their resilience. This just shows how much the @CAPS1 @CAPS7 them, and how thankful he is for their unwavering presence and sacrifice throughout his life."
556	12382	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful. It is happy and grateful in line with the author's reflections. The text says that growing up in this environment instilled in her a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. She is essentially saying that where she grew up, everyone was alike in spirit, that they did not have to be related by blood to be considered her people, and she is profoundly grateful for having them in her life. This deep appreciation for her chosen family defines the overall positive and thankful mood of the narrative, highlighting the value of community and unconditional support."
557	12383	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" written by the author, the mood created is deeply grateful. The mood is grateful and thankful throughout the entire memoir. The author is genuinely grateful that he had the parents he did, as they showed him through their actions that you do not have to be blood-related to be considered family. They demonstrated that caring for one another, always being present for each other, and loving each other unconditionally is just as important as sharing the same DNA. He also holds a lot of respect for his parents, who moved to a new location for a better life. However, they did not only better their own circumstances but also improved the lives of others; they always welcomed friends, extended family, and even people who just needed help into their home, making them feel welcomed and loved. Ultimately, the mood of thankfulness, gratefulness, and respect is what the author so clearly felt and successfully conveys in this memoir."
558	12384	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is very strong and multifaceted. Sometimes the mood is palpably sad, as when the author reflects, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially...The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" In contrast, the memoir's mood is also happy at other times, such as when the author notes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author, Narciso Rodriguez, effectively creates many moods in his memoir, including happy, sad, and several more, but his memoir ultimately ends on a happy and resonant note with the line, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."""
559	12385	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is happy and caring, but also sometimes sad. It was happy when the author got together with family members for celebrations and shared moments of joy. The mood was caring when his family demonstrated compassion by letting random strangers stay with them until they got on their feet, offering shelter and support. It was sad, however, when he could not see his grandparents for a long time, as they had to wait until they got permission from Cuba to reunite. This emotional complexity adds depth to the narrative, showing how different experiences shaped the author's understanding of family and belonging, but the overarching feeling remains one of love and resilience.
560	12386	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound gratefulness. Narciso often explains how thankful he is to his parents for their unwavering dedication and support. This is evident when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso starts off the memoir by talking about the significant hardships and challenges his parents faced, establishing the depth of their struggle. He then goes into detail about how, despite these difficulties, they managed to create a warm and nurturing home for him. Following this, he talks about all of the good times and happy memories that they shared together as a family. Finally, he concludes by thanking them one more time, reinforcing the central theme of gratitude that defines his recollections."
561	12387	5	3	The mood created for me in this memoir is a grateful, happy, and mostly thankful mood. I believe the mood is grateful because it is mentioned by the narrator many times, like during the third paragraph where he mentions how grateful he is to have parents who made good meals and taught him how to cook. Also, he said he was grateful for being introduced to Cuban music, which filled his home with joy. I think this memoir also has a happy mood because although the hardships are mentioned, it wasn't about how they struggled but how they conquered the hardships they faced when immigrating to a new country. Another way this memoir is happy is because he talks about how happy everyone is and how family makes a house turn into a home; it just touches your heart and gives you a sense of happiness and warmth. I think this memoir is mostly thankful because this whole memoir to me feels like a thank you letter to the narrator's parents for their guidance and unconditional love. That is how the mood created in the memoir to me was grateful, happy, and mostly thankful, leaving a lasting impression of appreciation for one's roots and family.
562	12388	5	3	"The mood of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* by Narciso Rodriguez is grateful, loving, cheerful, and fond. The whole memoir is looking fondly back at his home that he grew up in, reminiscing about the formative years of his life. He expresses his fondness of this time throughout the piece; in his quote, Narciso Rodriguez shows his gratefulness: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows how he is grateful for everything his parents have done for him, highlighting their dedication. He shows great cheerfulness through this quote from his memoir: ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows cheerfulness because it looks back on his family and environment in a positive and cheerful way, evoking vivid sensory memories. Throughout the whole memoir, fondness and love are shown, but they are highlighted the most in this quote: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote expresses fondness of his home and love for his parents, underscoring the emotional core of his upbringing. In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is both loving and fond as well as cheerful and grateful, creating a heartfelt narrative of his childhood."
563	12389	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates lots of moods. First of all, the author creates this mood that makes you want to cry, a poignant and moving atmosphere filled with deep emotion. While there is a kind of love mood here, it permeates the entire recollection. Narciso loves his home because that's where he grew up and he cherished it, holding those memories dear to his heart. Also, Narciso is graceful that he got the chance to grow up in a specific location, appreciating the unique environment that shaped him. Finally, he's happy that he has a Cuban culture and that he has good, caring parents who provided a nurturing and supportive foundation for his life. The author has good moods that collectively paint a picture of a cherished past, blending sorrow with profound gratitude and joy for his heritage and family.
564	12390	5	3	Rodriguez creates a grateful and playful mood in this memoir. For example, in the second paragraph, Rodriguez writes about how his parents cooked, and the music they played. In parenthesis, he adds his aside about how he was grateful for his parents' love of cooking and how he still adores the passionate music his parents played, which brings back fond memories. In a later paragraph, the author writes about the closeness and kindness of his neighborhood, describing the strong sense of community. He talks about how everyone was an immigrant and faced segregation, but were always willing to lend a helping hand, supporting one another through difficult times. Towards the end, in paragraph six, Rodriguez is grateful to his parents for the love and sacrifices they made for him, acknowledging their efforts to provide a better life. In conclusion, Rodriguez adores the home his parents created for him, and this deep appreciation is the enduring sentiment of his memoir, celebrating the love and resilience that defined his childhood home.
565	12391	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was to love your home and all of the people around it. The author is grateful for all of the skills that her parents taught her, like cooking, which she said that she was grateful for, and also music, which became a source of lifelong joy. She loves to cook and listen to Cuban music, traditions that connect her to her family and heritage. She also loves all of the people around her home and how they all came together in unison even though they were all different cultures, creating a vibrant and supportive community. She is grateful for all that her parents sacrificed to give her a better life, recognizing their hard work and dedication. That is what I think was the mood of the memoir created by the author is—a heartfelt celebration of home, family, and the diverse community that made it all possible.
566	12392	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was changing all through the book. In the beginning he feels normal, calmly explaining his life and how fundamentally important his parents are to him. When he explains the depth of their importance, he feels profoundly grateful and happy for all the things his parents positively impacted in his life. In the middle of the memoir he is explaining his current life, detailing how he likes the person he has become and how he successfully came out in life. At the end he is thoughtfully looking back at his life as a little kid and reflecting on how much he has improved his life since those early days. This progression of feelings creates a dynamic emotional journey for the reader.
567	12393	5	3	"Based on the memoir the mood created by the author was filled with lots of love and satisfaction. It was filled with love and satisfaction because Narciso and his family loves everyone for who they are as individuals. People from all over came and were welcomed to be a part of the family and it was perfectly alright with them. It said in paragraph @NUM1 that growing up in their environment instilled in them a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In their neighborhood, despite different customs elsewhere, all of the various cultures came together in great solidarity and genuine friendship. They were all proud and happy with everyone coming together as one large, extended family. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso said that he will always be grateful to his parents for their unconditional love and great sacrifice. Narciso had a loving mood because he is deeply grateful for what his parents have done for him. Last but not least in paragraph @NUM3 Narciso also had a mood of love and thankfulness because he learned the real, enduring definition of family and love. Narciso proclaimed, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a statement that perfectly encapsulates his heartfelt appreciation. This consistent theme of gratitude and love defines the memoir's overall atmosphere."
568	12394	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of profound love. One way that he expressed this in the memoir was by saying that his family had generously let in other immigrants to their house, offering them shelter and community. Also a way that this was expressed was by stating that his parents selflessly left Cuba to get a better life for their children, demonstrating their deep parental devotion. Furthermore the author of the memoir expressed this by saying that his family turned this simple house into a true home, filled with warmth and affection. This pervasive feeling of love is the central mood that the author successfully created in the memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
569	12395	5	3	"The mood the @CAPS1 creates in the memoir is a mixture of positive emotions. In reading the story you feel happy, and grateful, this is because the @CAPS1 is stating how great her family and friends were, along with how fulfilling her life was despite its simplicity. She also states that you dont need a lot of money or a big house to be truly happy, emphasizing contentment over material wealth. In paragraph @NUM1 she says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This indicates that she is very happy and she is very grateful to have parents like she does and that she would never want to lose them. She also states in paragraph @NUM1 ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" which shows the depth of her appreciation. To me, everyone should be this grateful to their family and loved ones because you never know when you're going to lose one, a sentiment that underscores the memoir's heartfelt and appreciative tone."
570	12396	5	3	The mood created by the author sounds like he's happy but sad at the same time, creating a complex emotional tone. He is happy to move to America for the new opportunities it represents. But he is sad cause his friends aren't going to be there with him in this new chapter of his life. Another thing is he sounds sad cause he is thinking about old memories and the life he is leaving behind. Those are the key things that describe the bittersweet mood that the author created throughout his personal narrative. This mixture of anticipation and nostalgia effectively conveys his internal conflict.
571	12397	5	3	"The mood that the author created was very happy and full of joy, consistently focusing on positive and uplifting experiences. None of the situations in the story were negative, as the narrative deliberately avoided any sorrow or conflict. They mostly were memories of good past times and how he grew up in a loving and caring family, which provided a strong foundation of support and affection. To prove this, in the first sentence, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement of gratitude directly highlights the author's deep appreciation. His parents sacrificed their hopes and dreams, a selfless act that shows their profound love and admiredness toward the author, cementing the overall cheerful and grateful tone of the memoir."
572	12398	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON2, the mood he created was being grateful, a feeling that permeates the entire narrative. The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez had in the memoir was deeply grateful, reflecting on his formative years with appreciation. He was very grateful that his parents loved and sacrificed their careers for him, putting his future above their own professional ambitions. Through these experiences, he learned the real definition of a ""family,"" understanding it as a source of unconditional support and unity. On paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This quote powerfully illustrates that Narciso's mood is one of being grateful about the unity and love he had at the place he called Home. This home was situated within a vibrant community with many diverse immigrants, mostly Spanish, Cuban and a few Italian people, which enriched his upbringing. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful about the opportunities that were left for him, which paved the way for his future success. Now he's an international clothing designer, a career built upon the values instilled in him during his youth. He will never forget the days he had in the traditional Cuban Home, and this lasting gratitude defines the core mood of his memoir."
573	12399	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, delightful, and unique, establishing a warm and positive atmosphere throughout the text. I believe the author is happy because he/she is very grateful for the love of cooking his/her parents passed down to him/her, viewing it as a precious inheritance. This is clearly stated when the author writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I believe he/she is delightful, a mood that is conveyed just through the way he/she wrote the memoir. The words she/he used, the way he/she wrote them just sounds delightful to be who he/she is, full of zest and appreciation for life. The author sounds unique to me because he/she is just happy that he/she is Cuban and is happy with what he/she has, embracing his/her identity and blessings without reservation. This is what I think the author's mood is in the memoir, a genuine and heartfelt celebration of heritage and family."
574	12400	5	3	The mood the author created was a peaceful mood, characterized by a sense of calm reflection and fond remembrance. She was bringing up good memories of her past life in her home, focusing on the positive aspects of her upbringing. She was saying how she was eternally grateful for everything her parents gave her and taught her, emphasizing the depth of her appreciation. Her parents taught her much about her heritage when she was young and kind, and she lived in a very diverse area growing up; there were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people, which contributed to her rich cultural experiences. While the memoir acknowledges that there were times of racism and violence, these instances are presented as part of the broader context rather than the focus. The overall mood she created in this memoir was a blend of sad, happy and peaceful, but the prevailing feeling that ties the narrative together is one of serene acceptance and gratitude for her past.
575	12401	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The @CAPS1 prints of our Lives, the mood conveys many things, but it is primarily one of heartfelt appreciation and cultural pride. The mood is the feel of happiness in his house, where his family shows him love and teaches him about his culture and heritage, creating a strong sense of belonging. I think this because in the story it says ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many thing I learned there about how to love."" This direct quotation from the text serves as the central evidence for the author's nostalgic and affectionate tone, highlighting the deep emotional connection to his childhood home and the lessons in love he received there, which fundamentally shaped his outlook on life."
576	12402	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, there are many moods woven throughout the narrative. There are happy, grateful, stressed, calm, relaxed and harsh moods. Some are happy moods because they have each other and share in endless celebrations. There are grateful moods because of all that Narciso's parents did for him and the sacrifices they made. There are stressed moods because his parents don't get the jobs they deserve, creating financial tension. There are calm moods to show the contentness he had in his home, a sanctuary from the outside world. There are relaxed moods to explain the feelings he had for his life within his supportive community and there was even harsh moods to show the tough times they went through and such as the struggles of immigrant life. Even though some moods are good and some are bad, this story ultimately shows the profound love they have for each other and that even though they might go through some hard times, they can stick through it together as a family."
577	12403	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author created a distinct mood through his recollections. First of all in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says ""here the innocent of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, endless celebrations... That formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that the author was trying to convey a happy and nostalgic sort of mood, illustrating that the setting they were surrounded with became the foundation to their warm spirited home as it said ""the backdrop life of our warm home."" @CAPS1 it also has a homey and welcoming feeling. Second of all it also says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This means that he felt he was close enough to everybody in his community that it was like family; they were all each other had, supporting one another no matter where they came from. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength, and perseverance, and thank them repeatedly for that."" This means that the author is trying to convey his deep thanks and gratitude for who his parents were and the person they made him. In conclusion the author created a mood through this memoir that family has many different meanings and is built on love and shared experience."
578	12404	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez uses a grateful and content mood in her memoir to reflect on her upbringing. @CAPS2 describes her house as warm and says that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Rodriguez is grateful that @CAPS2 had people who cared for her and offered support when @CAPS2 was growing up. Also, Rodriguez states that the cultures in her neighborhood had ""solidarity"" or unity, which contributed to a positive atmosphere. @CAPS2 was happy that everyone in her neighborhood got along so well. Rodriguez says that her parents came to @CAPS1 ""selflessly"", and this shows her appreciation for their difficult decision. Furthermore, the author states that @CAPS2 is grateful for her parents ""love and sacrifice,"" which were foundational to her life. @CAPS2 describes her parents as courageous and having strength as well as perserverance in facing challenges. Finally, Rodriguez says that her parents ""turned this simple house into a home"" through their efforts and love. In summary, the readers can see now Narciso Rodriguez's positive and appreciative mood in her memoir, highlighting the blessings of her family and community."
579	12405	5	3	"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez described their childhood home with great affection. The author creates a specific mood in this memoir. The mood is created by description of the kindness of his neighbors, his gratitude toward his parents, and how his house was turned into a home. The mood is first created by a description of the kindness of his neighbors. Narciso talks about his neighbor hood, calling it ""a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Narciso is getting the point across that his community was a warm, loving place, where everyone was friends and there was no conflict, but rather mutual support. Narciso also talks about his profound gratitude towards his parents. He says that, ""They came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Here, the mood is set as deeply grateful, since if his parent had not given all that they had had, he would of been in a worse situation in Cuba. Narciso further sets the mood by talking about the nature of his home. He says that, ""Countless extended family members came and went -- and there was often some one staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This adds to the warmth and generosity of his home, giving it a warmer, more inclusive environment. The mood in this memoir is set by @PERSON1' parents' determination, the kindness of his community, and the open arms of his home. All of these thing are the true definition of family."
580	12406	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood the author creates is peaceful and content. @PERSON1 says his family has a warm home, which means it's nice and quiet, a place of refuge. Where @PERSON1's family lived, the different cultures that lived in the neighborhood were friendly with each other, creating a harmonious atmosphere. In @PERSON1's family, they had countless extended family members who usually joined the family at the table for a nice meal and family get together, which were calm and joyful occasions. @PERSON1's family welcomed many people to their family, offering hospitality and comfort. @PERSON1 was very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, which provided a stable and serene foundation. His family had many rich culinary skills that they enjoyed practicing together. Their best skill was cooking, which was fun and relaxing to them, a peaceful family activity. Finally, growing up in the environment in New Jersey gave @PERSON1 a great sense that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" but was about shared peace and respect. Clearly, @PERSON1 and his family were very friendly and did many things that were peaceful, fostering a tranquil home life."
581	12407	5	3	"The author definitely created a mood when he wrote the memoir, and that mood is love. All throughout the memoir, he talked about how his parents' love for him had them leave their countries and come to the US. Because they loved him and wanted him to have a good life, they left Cuba, everyone they knew and loved, the jobs they had, and started all over in a new land. Their families' love turned the unfamiliar house into the warm home he loves and remembers so fondly. They brought the rich culture of Cuba into their new home with decorations and ""the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" a place filled with the aromas and sounds of their heritage. Ultimately, the memoir's prevailing mood is the profound and selfless love of the author's parents for him."
582	12408	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez, a clothing designer, wrote a memoir on his ideas about family. I believe the author set a very personal and intimate mood in this story. This is not unexpected considering it is a memoir; however, there were few statement facts and everything was drawn from personal experience and memory. Along with being personal, the memoirs also show a very loving and happy lifestyle they lived, filled with warmth and community. For example, there was always Cuban music playing along with the smells of Cuban food, and the parents would always host a person in the house who needed time to get back on their feet. Above all, the author clearly shows his deep love and admiration for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" With this powerful statement, the author clearly shows the mood for love and happiness that defines his family narrative."
583	12409	5	3	The story I just read was inspiring and thought-provoking. I realized that your true blooded family isn't only your family by birth; there are other people that you can bond with and after a little while you can become family according to how close you become. The mood created by the author was happy and uplifting. It was happy because everything he said in this story was true and heartfelt, and it made me feel lucky to have such a great family and friends that I call family. This feeling of gratitude and connection is the central emotion the author successfully conveys.
584	12410	5	3	"The mood about the author's memoir is his happiness and caring and the selflessness of his parents. According to the text, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote directly illustrates the emotional core of the writing. That's how the mood describes the author's memoir of Narciso Rodriguez's background and his family, focusing on the themes of gratitude and the sacrifices made out of love. The overall feeling is one of deep appreciation and warmth."
585	12411	5	3	The mood that the author used in the memoir was joyful and motivating at times. The author was able to paint a marvelous painting of his parents by using words such as brave, courageous, strength, perseverance, loving, caring, and gracious; this shows the reader that the author wants to paint a serious and respectful mood regarding their character. Also, when the author went on to describe his home, it gave a sense of a loving and joyful environment or mood. For example, the author was able to experience real friendship, endless celebrations, love, and the strength of helping others throughout his childhood. The author used a powerful sense of mood to show his passion for his parents and his home, creating a vivid and heartfelt portrait for the reader.
586	12412	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is happy and grateful. The narrator is grateful for all the great times in life him and his parents had together, reflecting on the simple joys that filled his childhood. He is happy that said ""times"" were so great and that they left such a lasting, positive impression on him. He is grateful for the happy times they had together like cooking, music, and so on, moments that were infused with affection and shared purpose. But he is mostly grateful for his parents turning his house into a home, for creating a space defined not by its size or furnishings, but by the unconditional love and security they provided within its walls."
587	12413	5	3	"I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships, emphasizing the deep bonds that connect people. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too, creating a cycle of mutual support. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you, a testament to the enduring power of kinship."
588	12414	5	3	The mood about the memoir was more of an up set memoir because of the way he was talking about his life. His tone suggests a lingering dissatisfaction or a sense of hardship that colored his past experiences. The details he chooses to highlight seem to focus on struggles and disappointments rather than joyful moments. This overall feeling of being up set permeates the narrative and shapes the reader's understanding of his personal history, leaving a somber impression.
589	12415	5	3	"The author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives. The first and most dominant mood is a sense of family or friendship. The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere. Next the author installed a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from cuba into this three room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth, a feeling of sacrifice and deep, abiding care. Finally the author gives us a Sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes...""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air..."" In these ways, the author reaches out to his readers with the mood of friendship, warmth, and culture to give us a taste of his life with his adoring parents in this small three room house he called home, a place rich with love and tradition."
590	12416	5	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 creates a warm, comforting mood in a piece of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. He does this by explaining what goes on in a positive light, focusing on the uplifting aspects of his upbringing. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congression of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm homes."" This quote uses words like celebrations and warm to show that this place was a comforting place that always had a great time, a sanctuary of joy and togetherness. This shows how Narciso Rodriguez created this warm, comforting mood through his deliberate and affectionate choice of language and memory."
591	12417	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood created by the author is grateful and family-oriented. Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez talks about his life growing up in a warm and inclusive environment. Readers encounter sentiments like: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage,"" and ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This expanded sense of community is a central theme. Towards the end, the author explains that he is profoundly grateful to have his parents, stating: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."", and ""in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Ultimately, Narciso Rodriguez was greatly influenced by his family during his childhood, and his memoir consistently shows that, along with the deep gratitude he will always carry for the foundation they provided."
592	12418	5	3	"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage, one that is deeply appreciative and warm. He talks about faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community, which contributed to this feeling. He speaks fondly of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the lasting ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" that was impressed upon him at a young age. The prevailing mood is indeed one of gratitude, specifically gratitude for how his parents struggled and worked to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, and he often groups the last two together because of the deep, emotional connection they all shared. Gratitude is one thing, so he doesn't have to search far to find the source of his positive outlook, which is firmly rooted in these early, formative experiences."
593	12419	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was showing the feeling of appreciation he had when it came towards the things he had and the people who surrounded him. In the article it says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" highlighting his expansive view of kinship. Also, his family was always happy and welcoming, creating a joyous atmosphere. In the text it said ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people that were considered family,"" which reinforced this inclusive and loving mood. Last but not least, the narrative touches upon the experience of building a new life even when they left everything behind, a common immigrant sacrifice. In the article it said ""Many immigrants give their children a better life even when it meant leaving everything they loved,"" a sentiment that adds a layer of poignant thankfulness to the overall mood of the memoir."
594	12420	5	3	In the memoir the author obviously seems to be grateful and thankful because he states it multiple times in the passage, establishing gratitude as the central theme. When he is recalling all the memories he had, it proves to be a warm and happy mood, filled with positive reflections. The cooking skills that his parents passed on to him he says that he's grateful for, and the passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day, are specific examples of this cherished inheritance. The author also states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well, where a strong community bond existed. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship, enriching his upbringing. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did, immigrating to a new country. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age. To wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home, a final testament to the loving environment they created.
595	12421	5	3	I particularly like this one because in this story the author sets a good, happy, and cultural tone to the narrative. This mood makes the memoir engaging and heartfelt. I appreciate the culture and how the story emphasizes that you need to appreciate what you have, a valuable lesson for any reader. And it clearly illustrates what his parents did for their children, showcasing their immense sacrifice. They undertook a great journey so that their children could have a better life in a new country, an act of love that defines the entire memoir's grateful and uplifting mood.
596	12422	5	3	"The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memories, consistently reflecting on them with warmth and appreciation. For example, ""and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful)."" The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful, emphasizing the lasting positive impact of his upbringing. His mood was also very appreciative, particularly of his parents' sacrifices. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families..."" The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him, a sentiment he reinforces throughout the text. He has thanked them many times, underscoring his profound gratitude. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage with a powerful statement. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author's parents bought a house that was big enough for his family, a significant achievement that contributed to his grateful mood due to his parents' efforts. Lastly, the author's mood was very thankful for the intangible lessons learned. For example, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" The author shows that he learns the true meaning of family and is very thankful to his parents for that foundational understanding. That's how the author's mood was characterized by a deep and abounding sense of gratitude."
597	12423	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, described the mood created by the author. The mood was resilient, grateful, and proud. The mood of the memoir was resilient, established through the recounting of significant hardships. For example, Narciso and his parents had to leave their home and come to the United States where they all struggled financially and personally, living through the cold winters and facing cultural hardships that tested their resolve. However, the mood was also grateful, providing a counterbalance to the narrative of struggle. Narciso was very grateful for his parents for all that they have sacrificed for him to have a better life, and all that they have taught him made the mood of the memoir grateful, highlighting the positive outcomes of their journey. Lastly, the mood was also proud, focusing on the immense courage of his parents. The parents came to the country with such courage without any knowledge of the language or the culture, leaving all their families and friends behind. Just so that their son could have a better life made the mood and the reader feel proud of the parents and their selfless act. These were the moods created by the author in this memoir, weaving together struggle, thankfulness, and admiration."
598	12424	5	3	"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez portrays a happy mood, which is evident through his reflections on his childhood and family. First he says how grateful he is for the customs passed down to him, which are a source of joy and comfort. Rodriguez writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows him grateful to his parents for passing on their culture to him, a gift that continues to bring him happiness. Next he writes about how they regularly had large dinners where they invited neighbors, creating a vibrant and welcoming atmosphere. Rodriguez writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" He is happy about how they invited many people over for dinner, and because of this they made many friends, reinforcing a sense of community and belonging.

Clearly in his memoir Narciso Rodriguez portrays a happy mood founded on gratitude, community, and familial love."
599	12425	5	3	Immigrants from Cuba to the United States usually had to undergo a tough transition, facing numerous obstacles along the way. It took buckets full of courage and motivation to get through this huge transition, a journey that demanded immense personal strength. Narciso Rodriguez's family went through this move using family power and the love they had for each other, which served as their anchor. It was a big change for them to go from a one-room apartment to a larger apartment, marking a significant improvement in their living conditions. Through the memoir there was a mood of satisfaction and love for Cuba, a nostalgic connection to their homeland. For example, the memoir stated many times how much Narciso enjoyed the Cuban food and music and traditions, which kept his cultural roots alive. Also the satisfaction mood comes out when Narciso talks about how fortunate he is that his parents were willing to take the risk of moving to America to give him a better life, recognizing the weight of their decision. This shows that the love of a parent is stronger than anything in the world, a central theme of the narrative. Another mood is relief, stemming from the family's safe arrival. For example, Narciso is relieved that his family made it to America safely and sound, a fundamental blessing that allowed for their new beginning. This article is a perfect example that family is all you have in the end and that no matter what they are there for you, concluding with this enduring truth.
600	12426	5	3	"In the Narciso Rodriguez memoir for *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, the author reflects on the foundational elements of his life. The author states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled"" certain values in him; this proves how he was raised and the lasting impact of his early experiences. Another point the author makes is about his parents' primary motivation, which was to give their children a better life. This shows that the children will get opportunities and comforts that their parents desired for them, fulfilling the immigrant dream. All this shows the key aspects of his journey: where he was born, how he got here, and him getting a better life through parental sacrifice, tying his personal history to a broader narrative of hope and improvement. The memoir thus encapsulates a story of transition, sacrifice, and the positive outcomes that can arise from difficult decisions."
601	12427	5	3	The author's mood in the memoir sounds grateful and very happy. This demonstrates that he was grateful because of Cuba's music, and he sounds like he loves to write about his childhood life. One example is in the article he was grateful to his parents for what they did. Because his parents worked hard financially to get where they are, this also shows that he was happy about meeting his neighborhood. One example is because he said they were all family to them. Another example was he felt warm because of that sense of belonging. He loves what his parents did to create such a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone.
602	12428	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional Cuban home in New Jersey, which provided a strong sense of cultural identity. Also, when he said that his parents always kept open arms and door, it reinforced this feeling. I think that meant that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time, fostering a community spirit. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite their customs came together in friendship, it highlights the unifying atmosphere his family cultivated.
603	12429	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is supposed to be warm, motivating, and inviting. The mood is mainly set when he describes the warmth of his kitchen: ""The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" creating a sensory-rich and comforting scene. The mood is inviting when he describes his parents' generosity by letting so many people come and share a delicious feast with them: ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Furthermore, the mood is motivating when he describes his parents' perseverance for a better living: ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" That was the powerful and multifaceted mood created by the author in the memoir."
604	12430	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a mood of thankfulness toward his parents. Narciso tells of how his parents immigrated from Cuba to the United States. He tells of the hardship of the sacrifice they went through, leaving behind everything they knew. In this memoir, Narciso says one line over and over. It is ""I have to thank them (his parents) repeatedly (Rodriguez 1)."" He is also grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice, which provided him with opportunities. In the last sentence he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (Rodriguez 1). In conclusion, Narciso is grateful for his parents' sacrifice for a better life for their child, a sentiment that defines the entire narrative."
605	12431	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was happy about his parents sacrificing for what they wanted for themselves and thinking about the family and what they needed. He also reflects on how New Jersey is different from Cuba, showing the contrast between his old and new life. They show him how to love because his mother would invite people who couldn't find a job to stay there until they could get back on their feet, demonstrating profound compassion. This act of kindness and the lessons in selflessness are how the author feels about the memoir and the values his parents instilled in him.
606	12432	5	3	"The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, in the memoir was grateful and it was imbued with a deep sense of gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1 he explicitly says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents made immense sacrifices, leaving behind their extended families, lifelong friends, promising careers, and the country they loved to selflessly come to @LOCATION1 with the sole purpose of giving their son a better childhood because they loved him that profoundly. Even though they had to change professions and take any possible work available to them, they persevered. They also struggled significantly with finances, harsh northern winters, and persistent cultural hardships that seemed unrelenting, yet they never gave up, and that is precisely why the author felt such profound gratitude, which effectively created the overall mood of the memoir."
607	12433	5	3	The mood is neutral yet appreciative in the author's memoir as he speaks reflectively about his house and family. He tells the reader how grateful he was to have loving and supportive parents, a sentiment clearly stated in line @NUM1 of paragraph @NUM2. The author also speaks about how important his family and friends were and continue to be in his life, highlighting these enduring relationships. The mood is somewhat happy and nostalgic because he was fondly remembering the good times and joyful experiences he had as a child growing up with his close-knit Cuban family, which left him with a warm and positive outlook.
608	12434	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is one of profound and heartfelt gratitude, as seen in the line, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author explains that he has often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done himself. He has frequently expressed his deep admiration for their strength and perseverance in the face of adversity and he has thanked them repeatedly for their actions. But in reality, the author feels that there is truly no adequate way to fully express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity that was impressed upon him at such an early age and for the powerful demonstration of how important family and friends truly are in life."
609	12435	5	3	The author primarily wanted people to understand the story's core message and to make the narrative easy to read and comprehend for the audience. His intention was to ensure that the central themes and the purpose of the writing were immediately clear and accessible to everyone, allowing the readers to grasp what the story is fundamentally about without unnecessary complexity or obscurity, thereby achieving effective communication.
610	12436	5	3	"The mood of this story is predominantly happy, hopeful, and caring, establishing a warm atmosphere. In some paragraphs, however, the mood notably shifted and felt upsetting and gloomy, as in paragraph @NUM1 with the line, ""They struggled both personally and financially."" At these specific parts in the memoir it felt genuinely sad and almost hopeless to witness the immense struggles they faced as immigrants. But then the mood shifted again positively. The author, Narciso, strategically used words with positive connotations like, ""courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration,"" which transformed the tone of this memoir into an exciting and happy story. They never gave up hope, and all the immigrants in the community helped each other with their shared problems. This collective support ultimately set a final mood of selflessness and caring, which is the very spirit the Rodriguez family brought with them to the United States."
611	12437	5	3	"The mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft, happy, and @CAPS1 mood. He tries to say how grateful and happy he is about his memoir, focusing on the positive aspects of his upbringing. An example is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their Rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" OR ""Passionate Cuban Music (Which I adore to this day)."" His mood is also saying that he is happy for what he has because he acknowledges that his parents are very courageous and he could have never done what they did. The author's mood is very grateful, reflecting a deep appreciation for the legacy and love his parents provided, which shaped his entire outlook on life."
612	12438	5	3	"In the excerpt by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of his home is created as one that is always happy and thankful. Narciso was always talking positively, never focusing on what was bad in his life. He talks about how his parents had to start over again with their lives to come to @LOCATION1, a significant sacrifice that defined their family's story. ""meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers..."" This quote means that his parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 for a better future. Narciso and his family have lots of friends like them because they keep their arms open to people, creating a welcoming and supportive community. Narciso's mood, set in the excerpt from his memoirs, is one of profound gratitude and positivity born from his parents' selfless actions."
613	12439	5	3	"The story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", has a comfortable and loving mood throughout its narrative. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways, evoking a sense of warmth and security. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it, sharing meals and companionship. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the ""Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"","" sensory details that enhance the feeling of a comfortable and inviting place. If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt, which talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone says how much love there was in the house, cementing the overall mood of this story as very comfortable and very, very loving."
614	12440	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates the mood of happiness when he talks about his parents' love and caring for others, establishing a tone of warmth and generosity. The author talks about in paragraph two when he was born and the environment he was raised in. His parents passed on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking, ""and for which I am eternally grateful,"" showing how these gifts became a lasting source of joy. His parents would play, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day),"" filling their home with vibrant sounds. In paragraph three, the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" In his neighborhood, everyone came together and extended a hand to people who were clearly in need, creating a broader sense of community. Rodriguez went on to explain how his parents would have everyone over for dinner and help people get back on their feet, demonstrating their open-hearted nature. Towards the end of the story in paragraph six he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso Rodriguez says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home,"" a statement that perfectly encapsulates the heartfelt and appreciative mood of the entire memoir."
615	12441	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was centered on his home, which was never perfect, but he and his parents made it into what it needed to be. His house was transformed into a home through the love and effort they all invested in it. The surrounding neighborhood also played a crucial role, teaching him how to love and showing him the depth of sacrifice his parents made. This experience provided him with a loving and appreciative perspective for his home town, shaping the grateful and affectionate tone of his memories. The memoir stands as a testament to this journey of creating a loving home from imperfect circumstances.
616	12442	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" is that of a profoundly grateful sense. In this memoir, Narciso reflected and sincerely thanked his parents for their immense love and personal sacrifice for him. He expressed this gratitude through specific memories, such as in the line ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family.'"" Furthermore, he reinforced this sentiment by stating, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These reflections collectively establish a tone of deep appreciation and thankfulness for his upbringing and the values instilled in him by his parents, which forms the emotional core of his writing."
617	12443	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that the author feels a deep and appreciative warmth for all of the memories that he has for his family as he was growing up. This feeling is directly conveyed through his reflection on the lessons learned within his family home, encapsulated in the poignant line, ""I learned the real definition of family."" This statement serves as the foundation for the overall emotional tone, highlighting a nostalgic and thankful perspective on his childhood and the foundational role his family played in shaping his understanding of love and belonging."
618	12444	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is one of gratefulness and of loving remembrance. This is because the author, Narciso Rodriguez, states directly, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In this quote, he is saying straight up how he feels, which is undeniably grateful, and you can also tell that he is implying a deep love for his parents. Another quote that supports this main idea is when the author says, ""... There is no way to express my gratitude..."" In this quote, just like the last one, the author is stating directly how he feels, which is again profoundly grateful. In conclusion, the author uses these effective and direct techniques to trap the reader in his mood, which is overwhelmingly grateful and fond."
619	12445	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez was happy and deeply grateful for his upbringing. He was profoundly proud of his parents for what they did to provide him with opportunities. His parents left behind their family and friends in Cuba to give him a better life. When they arrived in New Jersey, they had to start over completely from nothing. They acquired a house and diligently fixed it up to how they liked it, specifically renovating the house to look and feel like a Cuban home. Furthermore, his parents always took in people who came from Cuba and let them stay there until they got back on their feet. That enduring spirit of generosity and sacrifice is precisely why he was so proud and eternally grateful for his parents.
620	12446	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound love and appreciation. To start off, Narciso had so much love and appreciation for his parents' decision to immigrate to the United States. In the text, Narciso says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" The purpose of the author writing this was to strongly show how truly grateful Narciso is for the hardships his parents had to endure to give him a better life, and also to show the enduring love that Narciso will always have for his parents. Next, the author also expresses how important family and friends are to Narciso. He explains his true love for his family and friends, writing, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows how immensely important his family and friends' involvement in his life is to him. In conclusion, the author purposefully showed how important his parents, family, and friends are to him to fully grasp the deep meaning of love he feels for his family."
621	12447	5	3	"The mood created by the author is very happy and grateful throughout the memoir. It is very interesting also, when he's talking about when his parents first bought the house and how happy they were in 1961 when they made their home into a traditional Cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" In that passage he also says how he got his culinary skills from his parents and that he was grateful for it, learning to cook and appreciate his heritage. He also says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" From this you can tell a lot about his parents by those two sentences. They care about their children deeply. They're not selfish people. They're not afraid to make sacrifices for their family's future and they can adjust to new things and new surroundings with resilience. Therefore, by everything I have said the mood throughout the memoir was happy, kind, caring and many moods similar to those. The same moods came from everyone that was mentioned in the memoir, creating a consistent and warm atmosphere."
622	12448	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez provides the following definition of family in this memoir. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity & friendship, supporting one another. My mother & father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find to build a new beginning. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice, which they demonstrated every day. They showed me with their own lives & these teachings have been the basis of my life, guiding my actions and values. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent & music but life & love, a true center of our home. It was here where i learned the real definition of ""family"", one built on love and shared experience. And for this, i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love unconditionally. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home through their dedication and spirit."
623	12449	5	3	"The author of Narciso Rodriguez creates an enjoyably, happy, fun mood. The author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there & or were there at some point, painting a vivid picture. The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like I honestly was the experiencing his home & the love & kindness of his home, as if I could smell the food and hear the music. The love & friendship he shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too, highlighting a strong sense of community. He shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph, expressing his deep gratitude. Yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence, which reads, ""I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home."" He also especially shows how hard his parents worked to stay up but still did so much to care for everyone else, all right in the first paragraph, demonstrating their selfless nature and the foundation of the memoir's positive mood."
624	12450	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. It is a good mood and it also explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from cuba to the united States and starting over. It was a good mood because the parents of Narciso Rodriguez always let people who needed help in their home until they could get back on their feet, as mentioned in paragraph four, showing their generosity. Their is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad always a good attitude, an optimistic outlook that pervades the narrative. Narciso's parents let family and friends over for dinner all the time for cuban cooking and music, creating a lively and welcoming environment. Every One has such a great attitudes, contributing to the warm atmosphere. This selection has a soft, nice, and good mood that leaves the reader with a feeling of warmth and appreciation for family and community.
625	12451	5	3	Based on the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the ovor all mood is thankfull. It is that full because he is thankfull his parents came to america and that his connenity is helpfull and supportive. Also he can now have a good career and his family can grow up here to, achieving the dreams his parents had for them. Also his family and friends are importat to him, forming the core of his cherished memories and values. He expresses a deep sense of gratitude for the sacrifices made and the love that surrounded him, which defines the entire tone of his recollections and leaves a lasting impression of thankfulness.
626	12452	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cool and funky, a sentiment expressed not to mock but to offer genuine thanks. The author notes that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and a deep love for cooking, an important detail found in the second paragraph. This mood is further described as joyous, giddy, excited, and elated, which stems from the author's realization of what it means to have a ""family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture."" This particular evidence is located in another specified paragraph. Furthermore, the author's parents demonstrated their character by inviting refugees to stay with them until they could get back on their feet. His parents did this so that whenever they themselves needed anything, they would be alright, a final piece of evidence located in paragraph seven. These are the key pieces of evidence that effectively describe the overall mood of the memoir and where they can be found within the text."
627	12453	5	3	This story, basically, brings me back to my own memories. In the memoir, the author feels a happy, strong, and lovable mood. He feels as if those times are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember them fondly. He believes that once he gets older, he will take these good times for granted, yet even during future bad times, he will look back on them for comfort. Also, he will always be thankful for what his parents have done to make his life better and easier, ensuring he wouldn't have to live a hard, depressed life. Hopefully, he will always be thankful for that opportunity his parents gave him, a profound gift that shapes one's entire future. I know that if my parents did that for me, I would never forget them, a sentiment that underscores the lasting impact of such parental love and sacrifice.
628	12454	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, the author's mood was very loving, and I could detect the gratitude and respect in his voice, especially when he talked about his parents. He explicitly said, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author is obviously extremely thankful for the environment he had growing up as a child and surely feels very lucky to have had such a great, loving childhood. I can tell he is very proud of his parents because they gave up everything to come to a new country so their children could have better lives; the author referred to them as selfless, and I would agree with that description wholeheartedly. The mood of the entire memoir is mostly shown in the last two sentences where the author says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That final reflection perfectly shows the caring, thoughtful tone the author had as he remembered his past with such fondness and deep appreciation."
629	12455	5	3	The author set a distinct mood for this memoir, one defined by love and kindness. The reason love is the prevailing mood is because he explicitly states he loves his parents for their self-sacrifice, which was made so that he could grow up in the safety and opportunity of a new land. The mood is also one of kindness because he deeply appreciates that his parents were the kind of people who would let anyone in need through their door, offering hospitality without hesitation. This dual mood of love and kindness effectively captures the author's heartfelt appreciation for his parents' compassionate and generous nature.
630	12456	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of understanding and love, rooted in the idea that no matter where you are, you can always bring a piece of where you're from and place it in your present surroundings. For example, his parents decorated the kitchen in Cuban ways and listened to Cuban music, thereby actively keeping their heritage alive and vibrant. Through this, he comes to realize how great and hardworking his parents are, and how good they have been to him throughout his life. The author also conveys that even if you are not blood-related, when loved ones who care about each other come together, that collective bond truly constitutes a family, which is the central, heartfelt conclusion of his reflection.
631	12457	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound gratefulness and happiness. He was deeply grateful because of the immense sacrifice his parents made for him by moving to the US. His parents were remarkably selfless, a point he emphasizes by stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" A significant part of the overall mood was indeed happiness. One clear example of this happiness is when he learned the true definition of family through their actions, reflected in his words: ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" His happiness is further rooted in the security and love they provided, as he fondly recalls, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" highlighting their ability to create a warm and loving environment despite their new and modest circumstances."
632	12458	5	3	"The author creates a very comfortable and happy mood throughout the memoir. In the text, it says, ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This strongly suggests that many of the good memories Narciso had were centered in his kitchen, a place filled with warmth and familial tradition. The text also elaborates on this welcoming atmosphere by saying, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" This suggests that Narciso's parents were very caring and hospitable people, which gave their home a genuinely friendly and welcoming feel that extended beyond their immediate relatives. Overall, the author describes the home of Narciso and his family in a very joyful and affectionate way, painting a vivid picture of a nurturing and lively household."
633	12459	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful for his family, and this sentiment is a central theme of his memoir. During this recollection he expresses being both excited and profoundly thankful for the family he has. As was stated in the memoir, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" One clear example of how Narciso shows that he is grateful is when he notes, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" and has ""thanked them repeatedly."" Narciso conveys that he truly has a family that shows they care, and he deeply appreciates everything his parents have done for him. You can tell he is very grateful because of the earnest way he expresses himself about his family, declaring, ""In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" He is portrayed as a caring young boy who fully recognizes the value of his family's love and support."
634	12460	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood was consistently positive throughout the piece of writing. The prevailing mood in this recollection was very happy and appreciative. Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful and happy as he reflected on his childhood. He would always express that he was profoundly grateful for his parents being so kind and for making the decision to come over to the United States from Cuba solely to give him a better life. He also acknowledges the depth of their sacrifice, as his family gave up their friends and relatives, good jobs, and everything familiar, saying goodbye to their old life just to have a chance at a new and better one. He was also very happy because, even though he wasn't in Cuba anymore, his parents ensured he still grew up with a rich Cuban culture, maintaining a strong sense of identity and heritage within their new home.
635	12461	5	3	The mood of the memoir was ultimately happy because Narciso is happy about their move for the new opportunities it presented. While it is understandable that he would still miss his old house and the life they left behind, his predominant feeling is one of surprised joy at how his parents managed to transform his new house into a home once again. He expresses admiration for their ability to recreate the same sense of warmth, security, and family in a new place, which allowed him to feel settled and content. This successful transition, facilitated by his parents' love and effort, is what solidifies the overall positive and hopeful mood of his reflections.
636	12462	5	3	"In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood created is one of togetherness, love, and friendship. This story talks about coming to a new neighborhood in America and being welcomed in by an array of people whom you don't know, but are treated like family from the very beginning. The author recalls, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" No matter if you were Spanish, Italian, Cuban, or whatever else, you were treated with love and respect. This powerfully portrays the mood of friendship and caring because although they are not ""blood"" family, they take care of each other as a family member would. Narciso's parents are a large inspiration in his life, and he reflects, ""It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This heartfelt excerpt shows that by just being there and looking out for each other, a community can be brought closer to one another, creating a profound sense of belonging."
637	12463	5	3	"This memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" is very enjoyable. The mood the author establishes makes it really easy to understand and read. The mood of this story is not funky or overtly funny; instead, it is conversational, like having a regular, personal talk with a person. The reader gets a sense of this when the author adds little parenthetical comments, which gives the text a personal touch and adds more of a conversational feel to the overall mood. For example, in one paragraph, he includes the aside, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)."" This feels more like a fun fact or a personal note shared between friends. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" maintains a very formal and reflective mood, but with a personal twist woven throughout. The formal mood makes the memoir clear and easy to understand, while the personal twist makes the story intimate and enjoyable to read. This is a fine example of how to use mood correctly to engage an audience."
638	12464	5	3	The overall mood in this memoir is loving and thankful and calm. The author is just in a very good, reflective mood as he is trying to show his deep gratitude to his parents for all they have done and given up for him. They made a simple little house into a great, welcoming home for everyone who entered. They selflessly gave up great jobs and their familiar life for him so they could move to America for new opportunities. Him stating that he can't even fully show how grateful he is for their selfless acts powerfully shows his thankful and loving mood. This profound sense of appreciation and calm reflection permeates the entire narrative, leaving the reader with a strong impression of his family's devotion.
639	12465	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives written by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the excerpt is nice and warmly nostalgic. I think it is nice because the author expresses that he is profoundly proud of his parents, being Cuban immigrants, and about the concept of home. He reflects on his childhood with great affection, focusing on the positive atmosphere his family created. The tone is not one of hardship but of cherished memory, which contributes to this pleasant and appreciative mood. This feeling of gratitude and fond remembrance makes the memoir a comforting read about the foundations of family and belonging.
640	12466	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a main mood created by the author. I think this mood is one of happiness and deep contentment. To Narciso and his whole entire family, family is the most important thing, and no one ever leaves a family member out. In his neighborhood there mostly lived Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, and all these distinct cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso's parents came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. When I read this memoir I felt happy reading it because it is ultimately an uplifting story. It let me know how other families who really have nothing in a material sense can have everything that matters. Narciso's family is very close, and caring for one another, and to them family is the only thing that truly matters, which successfully conveys a mood of joyful fulfillment.
641	12467	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was powerful, joyful, and appreciative. The first mood created by the author in the memoir was powerful. This is evident from the statement, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage,"" which highlights the immense bravery of his parents. The second mood created by the author in the memoir was joyful. This feeling is conveyed through descriptions of ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebration,"" illustrating a life filled with happiness and communal gatherings. The last mood created by the author was appreciative, as shown in the line, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In conclusion, the moods created by the author in the memoir were powerful, joyful, and appreciative, effectively capturing the essence of his family's experience."
642	12468	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a passionate mood in his experiences of having a ""home"" rather than just a house, and how growing up in such a different community has shaped the man he has become today. Narciso is forever grateful for his parents' willingness to give up their good lives in Cuba and move to the United States for the sake of him and his future. The selflessness and thoughtful choices Narciso's mother and father made truly don't have words that are able to describe it, as their actions spoke volumes about their love. Narciso feels that you don't have to be related, of the same background or believe in the same things in order to be ""family,"" a belief forged in his vibrant neighborhood. The loving atmosphere of living in the neighborhood of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants was created by the feeling of coming together and having a good time, despite all of the differences that might have separated them. Narciso cherishes the memories he has kept of his childhood very much and will always admire his parents for the sacrifices they made for him, a sentiment that defines his heartfelt memoir."
643	12469	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is that he is glad to be born in New Jersey. He expresses a deep sense of gratitude and contentment for the life he has been given. He loves his parents for the sacrifice for making his life easier and better by moving to the United States, acknowledging the difficult journey they undertook. This profound appreciation for his parents' decision defines the overall thankful and positive tone of the writing, illustrating how their actions provided him with greater opportunities and a brighter future.
644	12470	5	3	The author, Narciso Rodriguez created a pleasant mood, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort, a place filled with warmth and joy. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck, creating a strong support system. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on, showing a wide and loving extended family. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter, embodying a spirit of generosity. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in America, so that he would live a better life than they had. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart with its sincere and heartfelt recollections.
645	12471	5	3	"The mood that the author created in this memoir is a happy, emotional, and caring one. They are happy because they are all living together in a perfect place all together, sharing their lives in a supportive environment. It is emotional because of the care and love they have for each other, a bond that is deeply felt throughout the narrative. They help each other out, demonstrating a community built on mutual support and compassion. In the text it states ""these are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basic of my life,"" underscoring how these values were lived and not just spoken. And those are some of my reasons why the author added mood to this memoir, effectively conveying the profound impact of his upbringing."
646	12472	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the central theme is family. This entire memoir focuses on family. Narciso first describes how he and his family came to live in a one-room apartment, sharing close quarters and creating a strong bond. He then said how he and his sister Rawedia Maria are going to move into a three-room apartment in the future, a prospect that filled them with excitement. In the memoir, Narciso said how his parents came from Cuba as immigrants to the United States, embarking on a difficult journey. Narciso couldn't believe how brave his parents were for undertaking such a risk. His ""real grandparent's couldn't leave Cuba until 1970, but his parents snuck out, a daring act that defined his future. Narciso said how his house was not a simple house because so many people lived in it, creating a bustling and lively environment. Some relatives lived upstairs, some down, making the home feel full of life. But the one thing that Narciso keeps saying to his parents is thank you, a recurring expression of his deep gratitude. If they got caught sneaking out of Cuba, they wouldn't be able to live in this nice place that Narciso calls home, a reality that underscores his profound appreciation for his parents' courage and sacrifice."
647	12473	5	3	The mood of this memoir is supposed to be nostalgic and thoughtful, evoking happy feelings. The author is talking about his past, when he was younger, reminiscing about those formative years. He loves his past life when he was little because it was full of happiness and good times with his family, moments of pure joy and connection. You don't need to be blood related to be family, as the memoir beautifully illustrates. All these good people got together and became family, bound by love and shared experiences rather than just genetics. And with this family came the good times, the laughter and the celebrations, making the mood happy and lighthearted. Never being able to thank your parents enough for giving you that chance to live a happy life is also part of the mood, adding a layer of deep, heartfelt thankfulness that permeates the entire narrative and gives it its emotional weight.
648	12474	5	3	The mood created by the author is very welcoming and comforting. It is explaining that their home was where all their great memories happened and all the get-togethers took place, a hub of familial activity. And that their home was a place you could feel safe and protected, a sanctuary from the outside world where one was always accepted. The mood I think of is warming, happiness, and joy, a consistent atmosphere that makes the reader feel the love and security that defined the author's childhood home. This feeling of warmth and contentment is the lasting impression left by the memoir, concluding the reflection on a positive and serene note.
649	12475	5	3	The son in the family is always happy in the memoir, expressing a consistently positive outlook. All he talks about is how grateful he is for his parents and the life they provided for him through their immense sacrifice. Everyone is happy and having a good time in the memories he shares, painting a picture of a household filled with laughter and love. This pervasive sense of joy and gratitude defines his recollection of his family life, showing how their togetherness created a foundation of lasting happiness for him.
650	12476	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, the mood created by the author in the memoir were happy and loving. Happy is one of the moods because there are many happy memories in the memoir, such as the descriptions of ""... endless celebrations..."" that filled his home with joy. Love is one of the moods because in a family most of the time you love each other, a sentiment perfectly captured in the line, ""I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice."" This deep affection and appreciation is a central pillar of the narrative. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* the moods created by the author in the memoir were happy and loving, effectively conveying a heartfelt tribute to his family and their journey."
651	12477	5	3	"In the memoir, the author definitely creates a distinct mood that you can obviously see and feel. He creates a mood of friendship in paragraph @NUM1, ""our landlord and his daughter (my baby sitter and first friend), lived above us and graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not,"" illustrating the close, familial bonds formed with those outside their immediate family. Also a feeling of love in paragraph @NUM1 (again), ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" which highlights the family's open and compassionate nature. The final mood he sets is a feeling of gratefulness in paragraph @NUM3, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a direct expression of his deep thankfulness. Therefore, the overall mood is his profound appreciation for his family and the supportive environment they created."
652	12478	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, a great mood is created by the author. This mood is unity. One reason why the mood is unity is because even while Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved from Cuba to the United States they stayed together, facing the challenges of a new country as a single, cohesive unit. After they had first moved to the @LOCATION3 they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play, strengthening their family bond. Another reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because, when the Rodriguez's were first living in the United States, the other immigrants in their neighborhood became family. And paragraph three it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A synonym for solidarity is unity, so here the author is even saying how his neighborhood all united into one big happy neighborhood, supporting one another. The final reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because even after all of these years, Rodriguez ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" To this day, his family is still united and they all still love each other, a testament to their enduring connection. In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is unity throughout Rodriguez's and his family's whole story."
653	12479	5	3	"In the article ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood created by the author is both loving and appreciative. In the third paragraph, the author describes that the neighborhood, (mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants) would come together to help one another if they needed it, and how they could be like a family without being blood related, creating a strong sense of community. In the fourth paragraph explains how extended family members could rely on each other, because they know that they would do the same thing if someone else was in need of help, reinforcing the dependable bonds of kinship. Those are two examples of how the mood is loving. Another way the mood can be loving, and appreciative, is in paragraph five. Paragraph five shows that @PERSON1' parents would do anything to make their childrens lives better; in this case it was leaving friends, family, and work behind and moving to a totally different country, a significant sacrifice made out of deep love. All in all the mood is given off as loving and appreciative even through the hard times of Narciso's life, highlighting the enduring positive feelings he holds."
654	12480	5	3	The author sets the mood in different ways such as describing where he lived before he moved, then when he told about his culture and him inheriting it, and then how he moved to @LOCATION1, tracing the journey of his life. He does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish, as this contradicts the generally positive tone. The biggest part of the mood is talking about where he lived at first, where and what he had, establishing a foundation of his early experiences. He might have a better start with mood if he told more about the kind of education he got whether he was in Cuba or @LOCATION1, adding another layer to his personal history. The mood was an overall ok because more about his life was shared, but the memoir was not a complete success in fully immersing the reader. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, organized life it was a good tone of mood, leaving the reader with a sense of his general contentment.
655	12481	5	3	@PERSON1 remembers his childhood fondly in his memoir about his home in New Jersey. He creates a setting that many people can relate to because of the general feel of family and heritage, which are universal themes. The tone in the memoir is nostalgic as he recalls the hard work of his parents, the people who he considers family, the food and the music, painting a vivid picture of his past. Rodriguez recounts his childhood as many people would, telling the readers how grateful he is to his parents and how warm and welcoming his home seemed, filled with love and support. Even in the time during segregation in the US, numerous people from different cultures formed the community of Rodriguez's home, which stood as a beacon of inclusivity. This place that Rodriguez describes is welcoming, and that is exactly the mood of the memoir, welcoming. The author recreates his welcoming, warm, musical home for the reader to visit and enjoy, successfully conveying the comforting atmosphere of his youth.
656	12482	5	3	"The overall mood of this excerpt from the book *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* by @PERSON1 is one of profound love and gratitude. This article shows that @PERSON1 is looking back with love and warm memories in his mind, and there are many examples to show that this is true. @PERSON1 described his home as ""(A) humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but with life and love,"" a description that shows how lovingly he thought of his home because he talked of how the house was consistently filled with life and love. He further described the people of his neighborhood as ""a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..."" @PERSON1 describes this community with a lot of affection in this quote, which also conveys a warm and inclusive mood. Throughout the piece, @PERSON1 constantly talks of his parents' great sacrifices, and he is eternally grateful for their efforts. For example, he says directly, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" This piece also talks of his friendly home environment where everyone was welcome, illustrated by his statement that ""My parents always kept up their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" Ultimately, the mood this article conveyed is a powerful feeling of love, warmth, gratitude, happiness, and acceptance, leaving a lasting impression of a cherished past."
657	12483	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" there is a certain mood created by the author which makes the story interesting and heartfelt. It has a playful tone underpinned by a warm and loving mood. ""@PERSON2"" recounts how his mother and father immigrated from Cuba in 1956, settling into a simple house when Narciso was born. Throughout the years, as the text notes, ""this simple house"" turned into a home"" (paragraph @NUM1). The house was filled with the loving family and special friends, turning it into something profoundly special in Narciso's life, a true home. How close his family and friends were added to the relevance of the home, creating a strong sense of community. This is captured in the line, ""It was the warmth in the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM1), which shows how special the house was to him. This feeling of deep appreciation also adds to the overall mood because of the thankfulness shown for these formative experiences. The author confirms this by stating, ""It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'"" (paragraph @NUM1). The memories from the home make the mood consistently loving and warm, reflecting a cherished upbringing."
658	12484	5	3	Your home @CAPS4 were you find happiness, joy, and peace. Not only is home a @CAPS1 to be @CAPS2, but it is a @CAPS1 for family to be unified and to grow together. In this @CAPS3, the author explains what it is to have a family and what it truly means and represents. Joy and peace is the over all mood, and that is precisely what family @CAPS4 feel like. Many families in @LOCATION1 are immigrants, and that diverse background is what makes up the fabric of @LOCATION1. Many people struggle to give education and happiness to their families, demonstrating immense dedication. They care deeply about their family's future and would leave their whole life back in their home countries to provide better opportunities for their children, and that is what families @CAPS4 do. The author is profoundly grateful for what his parents have suffered so that he could get a good education here and not suffer as they did. The mood is very calming, and the text beautifully describes what home and family @CAPS4 feel like, emphasizing security and love.
659	12485	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of self-determination, suggesting that if you were born in a place you have a heritage in or where family lives close to you, it is ultimately your decision to move or not. As it states, ""home is where one lived as a child."" In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says @CAPS1 will always be grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice. It took her a lot of courage to move to @LOCATION1, but @CAPS1 was glad that @CAPS1 did. In her house in Cuba, @CAPS1 had her first birthday there and remembers ""the warmth of the kitchin this humble house."" It was there that @CAPS1 found the true definition of ""family,"" and for that foundational understanding, @CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love,"" concluding with a sense of bittersweet appreciation for her roots."
660	12486	5	3	To me, the mood of the author is happy and reflective. The author thinks he's happy because in the article it talks about how he grew up and where he lived through his entire life with a sense of fondness. Also, it talks about when Narciso Rodriguez arrived in the United States, which was in 1956, marking a significant new beginning. Plus, it talks about how he helped the poor people in his own country before he moved to the US, indicating a generous and compassionate spirit. Narciso Rodriguez did a lot of stuff to help his country survive before he left, showing his deep commitment and care for his community, which contributes to the overall positive and fulfilling mood of the narrative.
661	12487	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author explains how happy Narciso was living in his Cuban home, appreciating the simple joys and the strong sense of family. The mood is also grateful. The author is profoundly grateful that his parents left their homes and left everything behind to give a better life to their kids. The author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a sentiment that underscores the entire narrative. The author is happy that Narciso had a real family, a source of constant support and love. Narciso was happy for the simple house they had and was deeply grateful for the life within it. The author says in paragraph five, ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" Narciso is grateful that his parents struggled just to make life easier or better for their children, recognizing the weight of their sacrifice. Those are what I think the moods are created by the author, a blend of joyful remembrance and profound thankfulness."
662	12488	5	3	The mood the author set was warmth and happiness, which permeates the recollection of his childhood community. He describes how hard it is growing up in a racist time, yet highlights how the real meaning of family is changed through different points of view, extending beyond blood relations to include the entire neighborhood. Also he shows how the parents are selfless and open minded even when things weren't going their way, maintaining a positive and welcoming attitude. He brings cultural diversity and understanding to describe the neighborhood's family-like relationship, illustrating how different backgrounds came together in a spirit of mutual support. This collective bond ultimately fostered the overarching feelings of warmth and happiness that define the memoir's emotional landscape.
663	12489	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez: From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" the author created many moods. One mood was community and Friendship. Narciso's parents kept their arms open for anyone who needed help, and so did every neighbor he had. They all came together and had fun even when they had different backgrounds, creating a vibrant and supportive environment. You had to make as many Friends as you could to help you live a healthy and fulfilling life in this new country. Another mood that was created was calm and comforting. In the house there was ""Passionate Cuban music"" and the air smelled of traditionally Cuban foods. This was because their family was Cuban so they wanted to keep traditions and make a better, more familiar environment for themselves. The last mood that there was was harsh and sacrifice. Narciso's Parents had to give up a lot like family, friends, job, and home just to move to the United States. And when they got here they had to start fresh and take any jobs they could find. His parents life was hard and they tried to make it as good as they could for their son. It was hard for them but they got by and did a great job, a testament to their resilience and love."
664	12490	5	3	The mood created by the author is a heartwarming mood. This is so because he talks about his parents with a passion of love and respect, reflecting on their character with deep affection. To me that is a heartwarming mood, as it centers on familial devotion. The author talks about his parents generosity, selflessness, and caring ways, which are vividly illustrated through their actions. In the memoir it says that the parents let friends and family stay with them until they got back on their feet, demonstrating their open-hearted nature. The author also talks about how the parents left their family, friends, and careers behind just so that the author, their son, could have a better life, an act of immense sacrifice. If that is not a heartwarming mood I don't know what is, for it truly celebrates the power of selfless love.
665	12491	5	3	The mood that the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The basis of the authors life has been the many lessons that his parents have shown him with their lives, lessons of hard work and integrity. The author is eternally grateful to his parents for passing on their love of cooking and their rich culinary skills, which became a fundamental part of his own identity and career. Narciso Rodriguez admires his parents strength and courage for what they did, leaving behind their homeland to ensure his future. This deep appreciation for their sacrifices and the values they instilled in him is palpable throughout the text. The mood that the author portrayed in the memoir is gratefulness towards his parents, a sincere and enduring thankfulness for the foundation they provided.
666	12492	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he explains and recalls the home he grew up in, reflecting on the small little three-room house and detailing how his parents made it feel like a true home. The mood Rodriguez created is a reminiscent and wistful recollection of his days as a kid in that house, filled with warmth and security. He talks about how his parents ""... both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking..."" (page 2.3-5). This shared responsibility in the household and the transmission of cultural traditions through food sort of sets up the mood of the narrator being deeply reminiscent and genuinely grateful for his life as a kid, appreciating the simple yet profound foundation his parents built."
667	12493	5	3	"The author made the mood in this memoir a nice feeling story and a motivating story. It's nice because of the actual story of the family moving to the United States, and establishing their own home with effort and hope. The family didn't just live with themselves; it was like all of their friends were like brothers and sisters, and nobody was ever excluded from their extended ""family."" It's motivating because even if you weren't of their race or background, they would still lend a hand to people clearly in need, demonstrating profound compassion. Everybody in the community acted as if they were blood related, but in reality, nobody was, which highlights the power of chosen bonds. Everybody just cared and loved for each other like parents, brothers, and sisters, creating a powerful sense of belonging. Ultimately, the mood in this memoir was one that had a nice feeling and it was a motivating story of unity and selfless generosity."
668	12494	5	3	"The mood in the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez centers on his family, and how not all family members are blood relatives. Narciso grew up in a house filled with culture and unconditional love. His ""young parents created a traditional Cuban home"" that Narciso would grow up in, a space rich with heritage and warmth. Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez talks about ""the real definition of 'family,'"" a concept that extended far beyond genetic ties. The author explains how there were people of no relation who were considered family, welcomed with open hearts. His parents would keep ""their arms and the door open to the people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us,"" fostering a deep sense of reciprocal community. Narciso Rodriguez tells of his home where he learned that a family is fundamentally a group of people who care for one another, and that inclusive, loving feeling is the defining mood conveyed in his memoir."
669	12495	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, created a mood of joy and happiness through his personal recollections. It set this mood because he describes having a nice and happy life, built on strong familial bonds. It feels happy that he can express his feelings so openly to us, the reader, creating an immediate connection. The writer makes me feel joyful because it reminds me of what my own family is like, with its open-door policy for loved ones. ""My parents always had their arms and door wide open to friends and people we considered family,"" a sentiment that echoes in many households. It is also joyful to know that most of his extended family will be coming to live with him, a hope for reunification. The writer tells us about how his grandfather and grandmother will be coming to the United States when they are allowed to leave Cuba, an anticipated event that fills the narrative with optimistic expectation. That is the mood the memoir set for me to understand its core message of love and hopeful reunion."
670	12496	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of being thankful for being united with his family, neighbors, and friends, and for the strong community that supported him. He expresses gratitude for all the things his parents have done to give him a good education and a stable home so he could have everything he needs to succeed in life. This profound appreciation for their sacrifices and the supportive environment they cultivated is a central theme, leaving the reader with a sense of his deep and abiding thankfulness for his upbringing.
671	12497	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is happy and grateful. @PERSON1 starts by explaining his profound love for his home and Cuban traditions, which were central to his upbringing. ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen... Passionate Cuban music... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This description establishes a foundation of joy and cultural pride. The author further shows his love for his neighbors and the wider neighborhood community, noting that even though the @CAPS2 was very racist, they still came together like a family, supporting one another through difficulties (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This sense of unity adds a layer of grateful appreciation for his community. Lastly, the author powerfully shows the mood by explaining his deep gratitude to his parents, reflecting on how they have done so much for him and his future. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3 and @NUM4). By writing so fondly about his love for his family, friends, and home, @PERSON1 successfully makes the overall mood one that is loving, happy, and profoundly grateful for all that he has been given in life."
672	12498	5	3	"The author creates a loving, warm mood that is felt throughout all of @PERSON1's memoir. For example, he recalls how his parents ""...passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). Rodriguez's parents loved to cook, something he remembers fondly, and he shares their love for food and music to this day, a continuity that deepens the emotional resonance. The reader feels this enduring love when reading the line. The reader also feels how much @PERSON1 loves Cuban music when reading the next sentence, as he even states how much he adores it even now. Another example that contributes to this atmosphere is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). @PERSON1 explicitly says ""warm home,"" and this warmth is definitly felt while reading this evocative line. The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations, consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can easily imagine this vibrant scene. Another example that reinforces this is, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents provided a warm envirorment opened to loved ones because they are very warm and loving people themselves, extending their family beyond blood relations. @PERSON1 and the reader feel the emotion because of @ORGANIZATION2's descriptive writing. One final, powerful example is, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6). The reader gets a clear feel of how much Rodriguez loves and appreciates his parents, with @PERSON1 even using the word ""love"" to summarize their relationship. His parents are loving people and so is @LOCATION1, creating a cohesive environment of affection. Ultimately, @PERSON1 had a warm and loving childhood, which he depicts greatly and effectively throughout his memoir."
673	12499	5	3	In this memoir, the author is showing the mood as one of profound happiness. The mood is happiness because the author is talking about how Narciso's childhood used to be when he was little, focusing on the positive and joyful aspects of his past. He fondly recalls the welcoming enviroment of his home and the richness of his Cuban culture, which were sources of great joy for him.

674	12500	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the mood is very welcoming and warm, established through the author's recollections of community and family. An example of this mood is when it said, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense That 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. All of the different cultures came together in friendship."" This illustrates how their home was a hub of inclusivity. The parents of Narciso came to the United States with a lot of courage and determination, facing immense challenges for the sake of their children's future. They didn't know anything about the language or the culture, yet they were driven because they just wanted their children to have a better life than the one they left behind. They left behind their own family and friends, making a significant sacrifice. In their new house, they welcomed all other refugees upon their arrival, extending the same warmth they hoped to find. They still had traditional Cuban feasts, preserving their heritage, but through these experiences, he learned the real, expanded definition of family built on love and shared experience rather than just lineage.

That statement clearly shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life full of great friends and families who shaped his character. The mood of the memoir is very up-beat and positive because Narciso is talking about how great his life has been since @CAPS1 was born, focusing on the blessings he received.

He knew that the move would have to be a big sacrifice for his parents to do so he thanks them often, expressing his heartfelt gratitude. No matter where Narciso was, either a good place or a bad place, he always found happiness, maintaining a positive outlook. This @CAPS2 doesn't have a lot of different moods but few similar ones.

678	12504	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" a certain mood was created. The type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and @CAPS1 mood. It was because of the different things that were happening in this community, and more importantly the house. This house had become a home to Narciso because of all the different activities that would happen there, like the Cuban music, the constant in and out of extended family members, and the fact that this all happened because his parents selflessly came to this country to give him a better life, even though they had to leave behind their families, careers, in the country they loved.

One example of how the author creates the mood is, when the author says ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" That creates a mood of happiness and love. That's because the author shows it by saying created our traditional Cuban home, which evokes a sense of warmth and cultural pride.

""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""(paragraph @NUM1) This quote @MONTH1 make some wonder if they are grateful for what their parents did for them, prompting a moment of personal reflection. While reading people @MONTH1 also reflect on if they lived in a home with people they love around them or a house, contemplating the true meaning of a home built on love and connection rather than just a physical structure. This introspection is a central effect of the memoir's reflective tone."
682	12508	5	3	In the story Narciso Rodriguez by The blueprints of our lives, the author's mood in this story is very happy, generous, and humble.

And very generous because her parents moved for her education and to get good money to make us happy, putting their children's future first. The girl's parents welcome anyone into their home as family, and thats why she loves them too, learning the meaning of hospitality. But I have to say she's mostly grateful, a feeling that permeates the narrative. Because her parent's are doing every thing to make her happy, and they even have to accept getting a job they dont even like, demonstrating profound commitment. And for their love and sacrifice, which forms the foundation of her gratitude. And that's what mood the author feel's in the story, a complex blend of joy and deep thankfulness.
683	12509	5	3	"The mood in the story was very nice and deeply appreciative. Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful to his parents and friends because of their great solidarity and friendship, which shaped his character. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a direct expression of his feelings. Narciso's parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the @LOCATION1, creating a warm and inclusive environment. They taught Narciso rich culinary skills that he would never forget, gifts that lasted a lifetime. Narciso also learned how much his family and friends mean to him, understanding the value of community. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life,"" underscoring the lasting impact of their example. Narciso's friends and family taught him the real meaning of the words family and home, lessons he carried forward forever."
684	12510	5	3	The mood of the memoir is happy and thankful, filled with warm reflection. The author explains how his parents brought him to the United States, seeking a better future. All of his neighbors were spanish, cuban or Italian, creating a vibrant, multicultural community. They were all friends and had a good bond, supporting one another like an extended family. He had people at his house for dinners, where laughter and stories were shared freely. It was here in the United States, that he really understood what family was or what a home was, a place of love and acceptance. He couldn't show his parents how grateful he was for them to go through such a hard time to make their childrens lives better, a debt he felt deeply. The thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful and resonant for anyone who reads it, leaving a lasting impression of gratitude.
685	12511	5	3	The mood created by the story could be described thanfullness or gratitude, a profound sense of thankfulness. After reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents, prompting a comparison to one's own life. The author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them, acknowledging an immense debt. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright, proving that love outweighs material lack. It makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who I am, recognizing their formative influence. The mood that is created by this story is admiration for the selfless acts of parents everywhere.
686	12512	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home by the blueprints of our lives the mood is homely and friendly. The mood of friendliness is displayed from his past experiences.

Also his mood is from the music. In paragraph two it states, ""@CAPS1 Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows the culture lurking and dancing through his house of his childhood, creating a vibrant and welcoming atmosphere. Lastly the mood is interpreted from his family.

This shows how friendly and inviting the household were, always open to family and close friends. The mood set in this home is friendly and inviting, a testament to the warmth of his upbringing."
687	12513	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is warm and friendly. This is easily recognizable because all of the recollection was based on his family and his tightknit community. @PERSON1 correctly explains everything about his home that made him who he is today. @PERSON2 also explains about his community and the diversity there. He talks about how his neighborhood is mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. It @MONTH1 seem like this would be a tough neighborhood but he specifically says, ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @PERSON1 also describes what life is like in his house he tells the reader that the ""heart"" of his house was the kitchen. His mother was always in there cooking a traditional Cuban meal, a focal point for daily life. He also says that everyone (his landlord, his surrogate grandparents, his aunts, his cousins, and his extended family) would come to his house for dinner, reinforcing the sense of community. Another thing is @PERSON1 would always praise his parents throughout the whole story. He would talk about how selfless and kind they were. He thanks them for his success in life. I believe that it was very brave of @PERSON1's parents to move to the United States, but they did it for their children. @PERSON1 ends the article with a very inspirational quote. It is, ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is the mood @PERSON1 sets for his memoir, one of deep appreciation and familial love."
688	12514	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of happiness and gratefulness in his memoir. He talks about how his family is always celebrating @CAPS1 from their native Cuba. The memoir states, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban Feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music by life and love,"" about the house Narciso grew up in, highlighting the joyous family gatherings. Narciso's parents came to america ""to give their children a better life"" which makes Narciso grateful to them.

689	12515	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from @CAPS1: The Blueprints of Our Lives The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cultural and family. The mood is very cultural because they created the home into a cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. The Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking to their children, preserving their heritage. The mood is also family because when someone needed a place to stay from their family they would let them stay at their house, offering support and shelter without hesitation. This combination of cultural tradition and familial duty creates a deeply rooted and affectionate atmosphere throughout the memoir."
690	12516	5	3	"This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez has a grateful mood. @CAPS1 is thanking his neighbors for the unity that @CAPS1 had in his community and explaining how @CAPS1 learned about family from them. @CAPS1 is also thanking his parents for giving up everything they had in Cuba to give him a good home. For example, @CAPS1 explains that @CAPS1 had a ""close-knit community of honest, hardworking,"" ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when Overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed."" @CAPS1 says his neighbors helped people who were, ""not necessarily their own kind, (but) were clearly in need,"" teaching him powerful lessons in compassion. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 describes the things @CAPS1 loved about his ""traditional Cuban home"". In paragraph @NUM2, @CAPS1 says, ""My Mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love. @CAPS1 describes his parents hardships and says @CAPS1 will, ""always be grateful... for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 makes it clear that the passage is written with gratitude for the sacrifices made on his behalf."
691	12517	5	3	"The author's mood was happy, thankful, grateful, caring, and thoughtful. The mood was happy because he was sharing his life story, and reflecting on what his parents did for him and his siblings made him feel deeply happy and grateful. He is very thankful because his parents could have stayed in Cuba and let them grow up there, but instead they chose to come to the United States and struggled at first. The end result, however, was more than they could have ever imagined. He described his parents as being very caring, always putting their children before their own needs. The author sounds very thankful to have grown up here rather than in Cuba because he now sees that he had a much better life as a result. Having a family like he did, he truly cherishes the word family. At the end of the excerpt, he said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means the structure was just a random house when they moved in, but through their love and effort, it became a true home filled with warmth and memories."
692	12518	5	3	"The mood of the memoir created by the author was that he was very grateful for what his family has done. This is evident because throughout the memoir he consistently expressed how much he appreciated the way his parents made this house into a Cuban home, infusing it with their culture and love. The mood of the memoir is also grateful because he mentioned how he liked that his neighborhood had many different cultures, such as Spanish and Italian, which contributed to his rich upbringing. The author's profound appreciation is perfectly captured in his statement, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This heartfelt reflection on family and belonging is what defines the grateful mood of this memoir."
693	12519	5	3	The mood of the memoir is generally happy. Narciso talks about how wonderful his home was growing up, recalling the vibrant music and the delicious food that filled the rooms. He speaks fondly of his family's happiness and how the house he grew up in was transformed into a true home through their shared experiences. The mood is happy because it makes you feel the warmth and love he felt living with his parents in that home in New Jersey. To conclude, the mood is one of happiness, proudness, and fondness, as it vividly brings back the memories of anyone's first home and the love that was present there.
694	12520	5	3	"In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez, the tone is happy and loving. There are many examples that illustrate this loving and happy tone. For instance, in one paragraph, there are two phrases in parentheses that show how the author loved the music and the cooking of his home and family: ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)."" The author would not have added these details unless he truly meant them and genuinely loved his home. Also, what sets the tone is how the author talks about loving his parents and how he is grateful for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" he states in the first sentence of another paragraph. Lastly, the final sentence of the memoir is happy and leaves the reader with a smile: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In Rodriguez's memoir, this happy and loving tone is consistently present throughout the entire narrative."
695	12521	5	3	The mood of the memory is happy and loving, filled with a deep sense of appreciation and warmth.

The loving atmosphere of the home is remembered as a source of comfort and happiness, leaving a lasting and fond impression on the author.
696	12522	5	3	"The mood which Narciso Rodriguez showed in the memoir was deeply thankful and grateful to his mother and father for their immense love and profound sacrifice they went through when he was growing up. He was very thankful for their giving arms, which were open to anyone who needed them, and for their consistently warm attitudes and essential teachings of what family really defines. Narciso learned this definition directly from his parents; family is or can be anyone important to you and they do not have to be blood related, such as a neighbor with a different culture who becomes like kin. He is also very grateful for his parents' complete unselfishness, demonstrated by moving to @LOCATION1 solely for his education, not even putting the thought of their own work or comfort first in their heads. Narciso's profoundly appreciative mood is represented in every single sentence in this memoir written, as he feels he was very lucky to have had such a great childhood and a supportive ""family,"" which he fully realizes and will be grateful and thankful for everything anyone ever did to help him grow up to who he is now for the rest of his life."
697	12523	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is one of profound love. My reason for thinking this is that the story talks extensively about how the parents sacrificed everything they had to move to @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children, which is a powerful act of love. Another reason why love is the central mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family, bound by affection rather than lineage. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying and heartfelt gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and for making the place he lived in feel like a true home, filled with warmth and security. That is why I think the overarching mood the memoir creates is love."
698	12524	5	3	"The mood is set to a sad feeling, reflecting the challenges faced. Filled with descriptions of poverty, the author sets it up this way to convey the hardship of their situation. There is a strong mood of love too, which provides a counterbalance to the sadness. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showing how love can flourish even in difficult circumstances. It also says that they learned the real definition of family through these shared struggles. this is why it is set to a sadly love mood, a bittersweet mixture of hardship and deep affection. They were immigrants, which added to their struggles, yet their story is ultimately inspirational, showing how love and resilience can overcome adversity."
699	12525	5	3	"In my opinion I think that the author sets a loving mood. Here are my points to consider. First of all he explains how much he loves his parents and appreciates them. An elaboration of my point is that he uses strong, heartfelt words to show that he loves them a lot. For example, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength,"" demonstrates his deep respect and affection. Second of all he talks about his family and the love they shared through their actions. An elaboration of my point is that he explains what immense courage they had in starting a new life. For example, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language,"" highlights their loving sacrifice for the family. Third of all he explains how much his house meant to him, as it was filled with love. He talks about the cherished memories he had there that shaped him. For example, ""I will never forget that house... or the many things I learned there,"" underscores the loving foundation it provided. In conclusion that's why I think the author sets a deeply loving mood throughout his memoir."
700	12526	5	3	The author's memoir was profoundly important to him; a life that meant a lot to him was shared with the whole world to read. He chose to put his personal experiences and heartfelt memories onto the page, offering them to a wider audience. This act of sharing his story demonstrates how significant these life lessons and familial bonds were to his identity. By writing his memoir, he allowed others to understand the values and people that shaped him, making his personal history a public testament to what he holds dear. In doing so, he ensured that the impact of his life and the love within it would be communicated and remembered.
701	12527	5	3	The mood in this story is predominantly positive, as the author warmly describes his home and expresses his deep affection for it. He praises his parents for taking a chance in America, highlighting their courage and the hopeful beginning this represented for the family. This positive feeling is rooted in the security and love of being together as a family in their new home. However, the mood could also be interpreted as having a tinge of sadness because they had to leave their friends behind in their homeland, a loss that undoubtedly carried emotional weight. Ultimately, though, the overarching mood remains positive because they successfully made it to America and are united as a family, which is the true essence of home.
702	12528	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and love. The memoir is about happiness because in paragraph @NUM1 he explains how fun and happy his home is, describing the lively atmosphere and the joy found in simple daily routines. His family cooks together, an activity he really appreciates for the sense of togetherness it fosters and @CAPS1. The shared meals and the warmth of the kitchen contribute significantly to this cheerful mood. I also think this memoir is about love because throughout the whole text he talks about his appreciation and deep love for his family and friends, emphasizing the strong bonds between them. The author’s heartfelt expressions of gratitude and affection consistently reinforce these central emotions. And that is why I think the overall mood of this memoir is happiness and love.
703	12529	5	3	"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But this central theme of love branched out into related feelings of gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown extensively through family in this memoir. The profound love of the author's parents is clearly illustrated in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" This parental love is shown again in the same paragraph when it states ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes powerfully show the deep love and dedication that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also prominently shown in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM3, it demonstrates this hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the welcoming and caring nature of the neighborhood. The other mood that the author created was gratitude, which is evident in paragraph @NUM4, as shown by the statement: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how immensely and genuinely grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the primary ways that the author effectively shows the mood in the memoir."
704	12530	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a distinct mood for the story. The mood for his story is decidedly bittersweet. It is happy, but also slightly sad, blending these two emotions throughout the narrative. One way this is shown is when @CAPS1 mentions his grandparents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)."" It @CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had loving ""surrogate grandparents,"" @CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until much later on in his life, creating a sense of poignant loss alongside familial gain. Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents' sacrifice. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It @CAPS2 that his parents made a profound sacrifice for him, which is both admirable and sorrowful. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by expressing his admiration for his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is deeply grateful for what they gave up so @CAPS1 could have a good life, a sentiment that is joyful yet underscored by the cost. In this way, Rodriguez effectively conveys the happy, yet sad times detailed in the memoir."
705	12531	5	3	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, the author created a distinct and uplifting mood for @PERSON1. The mood the author created was something uniquely positive, and it never seems to diminish or go down. As Narciso Rodriguez really gives you the true definition of ""family"" in this memoir, the mood remains consistently warm. One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" In the paragraph before that, they talked about moving into a new home, and how the heart of it was the kitchen, where they cooked while listening to Cuban music. Narciso said, ""she's eternally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to Cuban music."" It's a happy mood, showing fond and cherished memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Here, Narciso's mood becomes suddenly more serious and strict, but is overwhelmingly proud of her parents and their bravery. The last example would be found in the final paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" and ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and proud to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her, emphasizing a deep sense of belonging. The mood the author created for Narciso Rodriguez was always one of pride and happiness, but never sadness, as she had a lot of cherished memories from that one home."

In paragraph @NUM2 it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This direct statement underscores a deep and abiding sense of appreciation. And in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author loves his home for all the memories and friendships it holds, and is grateful to his parents who provided him with it, a sentiment that resonates throughout the entire narrative."
707	12533	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is happiness, and friendship, and glory, an example is ""My parents always always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This illustrates a profound sense of community and mutual support. A feeling of friendship and honesty is ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, where clearly in need."" and that is the mood of the memoir, one defined by collective strength and shared experience. This overall atmosphere of warmth and solidarity is the central emotional tone the author conveys."
708	12534	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the memoir gives a loving and thankful tone. The loving and thankful tone is showing the definition of ""family"". In paragraph seven the author states, ""and for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that the tone is thankful for what the parents had done and love them at the same time, emphasizing the transformative power of their affection. The author’s reflection is filled with a profound sense of debt and warmth. As I aforementioned, the tone is love and thanked, creating a consistent and heartfelt atmosphere throughout the piece."

In the memoir, he talks about the house he grew up in and the love in his home. Rodriguez describes the warmth of his kitchen and every thing that went on in it. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez also describes the connection between the family and friends around him, ""countless extended family members came and went...My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (paragraph @NUM2). This reinforces the theme of open-hearted hospitality. With all of the love in this memoir, there is also a serious tone when the author describes the difficulties his parents had to face, to give him the best life that he could have. You can tell that Rodriguez has great respect for his parents, a respect that deepens the overall emotional impact of his recollections."
710	12536	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a clear mood created by the author. For instance the Cuban background set the mood of happiness. Narciso explains, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I'm eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows his love and happiness from his Cuban background, a vibrant sensory experience.

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This immense sacrifice forms the foundation of his appreciation. Also, Narciso gives a feeling of deep admiration for his parents. He admires their courage for leaving all the wonderful stuff in Cuba and starting anew in a foreign land, as he says in paragraph @NUM2: ""I've often told them [his parents] of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""

713	12539	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez created a very positive and warm mood throughout the memoir. The mood that was created by the author was happy and appreciative. I chose this mood because in the memoir he describes how nice it was to live in a town where people genuinely cared for him and looked out for one another.

715	12541	5	3	The author of this story created quite a distinct and comforting mood in these few paragraphs. As I read this I could feel a warm welcoming from home, a sense of belonging and security. The mood would have to be grateful and happy, feelings of which we are expected to feel on @CAPS1. The author talks about his kind parents and loving family, describing a household filled with generosity. About how his parents was so selfless, and would always lend a hand to anybody needed help, no matter who they were, embodying a spirit of community. He also talked about his loving neighborhood, and not blood related families who were just as close, illustrating that family is built on love more than just relation. I believe the author created a great mood that reminds you of home and makes your heart smile, effectively conveying the warmth of his upbringing.

This shows that he sounds very grate ful to his parents for everything that they have done. The mood also sounds very loving because he loves his parents for moving to America. His parents also sound loving to him because they were brave and sacrificed a lot for him, demonstrating their deep care. These things are why the mood of the memoir is loving and grateful."

Also his friends could come over too, adding to the cheerful atmosphere. While he was explaining how he didn't ever get to meet his real grandparents from Cuba he didn't sound as happy as before, and the text was more happy initially.

When he said that his mood went to happy and thankful for everything his parents gave him in his life; also, like the main thing is his cooking skills came from his parents too, and he is very thankful for what he has.

This fond recollection is paired with another statement from @CAPS1: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 there I think Narciso is happy, and this feeling is supported by the author's own words. The mood is mostly calm & happy because @CAPS1 is telling the courage his parents had, focusing on their positive legacy rather than any hardship.

724	12550	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez created a very warm, loving, and overall positive mood in his memoir. Throughout the memoir everything is positive, viewed through a lens of affection and strength. For example, he describes his parents hardships here in the @LOCATION1 Not with pity for them but with pride. They were ""braving the harsh Northern winters"" not dying because of the cold, they were strong and resilient in the face of new challenges. Rodriguez also describes his community in a similarly positive light. He portrays it as a close-knit community almost like a family who extended their help to anyone in need, emphasizing solidarity and support. Rodriguez clearly has a very good outlook on what his childhood was like, and this optimistic perspective firmly establishes the memoir's heartfelt and affirmative conclusion."
725	12551	5	3	The mood of this story is very happy because the author is describing his childhood memories and all the great times he had in his home, recalling them with vivid affection. He says over and over that he loved his home when he was a kid and enjoyed hanging with his family, emphasizing the joy found in these simple, everyday moments.

726	12552	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and thankful.

727	12553	5	3	"In this memoir, the author creates a very nice mood. The mood he creates is comforting, yet at the same time, it is grateful and happy. The author creates a comforting mood because he talks about his home, his family, and what he grew up with. He talks about how his parents played Cuban music, cooked Cuban meals, and turned the ""...Simple house into a home."" When he talks about how generous and wonderful people his parents were, the reader feels a sense of comfort. Also, when he talks about how he lived in a neighborhood that was a ""...close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need,"" the reader feels a sense of comfort. The author also creates a grateful mood because he is always talking about how he will ""...always be grateful to [his] parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is grateful for all the things his parents have done, from leaving Cuba, their jobs, family, and everything behind when they left just so he could have a better life, to how well they raised him and all the things they did during his childhood. This profound appreciation, combined with the warm memories of his upbringing, creates a deeply happy tone. Throughout the memoir, the author constantly creates a comforting, grateful, and happy mood that resonates with the reader."
728	12554	5	3	The mood in this article was just stunning because explaining how your parents were very good and explaining how they raised you well gives people the thought this is very good, especially when you are having fun with friends and family. Reading about such positive family experiences can inspire readers to reflect on their own cherished moments. The author just set off a good mood towards the readers in this article because people like to read something that would make him or her happy, and this story made me feel good about myself and family, just like the family he or she has in this article. The uplifting narrative successfully fosters a sense of joy and familial appreciation, leaving the reader with a positive and heartwarming impression.
729	12555	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes his family factually, as well as loving and inviting. In paragraph two, Narciso tells how his family interacted in their house. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" Here, Narciso lists the facts about his childhood. The memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents shared their love and compassion with everyone else, and that is what Narciso is grateful for; for the love and sacrifices his parents made for him. The powerful words he uses in the last two paragraphs puts the memoir into a mood of love and perhaps even sadness, a poignant mix of joy for the past and sorrow for its passing. The words he uses can tell they are from the heart; the memories of his parents as well as the rest of his family influenced his life, and he learned the true meaning of family through their enduring example."
730	12556	5	3	The author created many types of moods in this memoir. At one point in the text he creates a sweet type of mood by describing his home, his mother and father, and how the kitchen was the heart of his house, filled with warmth and the smell of home-cooked meals. At another point in the text the author created a welcoming mood. He creates this mood by telling the reader about how his family took everybody in. His family always helped their friends, and when family visited they always had a place to stay. He also created a sad tone by talking about how he'll never be able to express his gratitude towards his parents fully. Finally, at the end of the text the author creates a sincere mood. He creates this sincere mood by expressing his gratitude towards his parents for being so selfless and for the profound lessons they taught him. Those are the ways the mood changes during his memoir, creating a rich and emotional narrative.
731	12557	5	3	In the memoir of @PERSON1, the author shows a lot of mood throughout the story. Happy and grateful stand out as the two most important and pervasive moods. @PERSON1 is very grateful throughout the memoir. He is grateful for his friends and family, especially for his caring and selfless parents. He reflects on all of the hard work they did and what they gave up back in Cuba in order to come to @LOCATION1 for a better future. His dad worked diligently in the laboratory and his mom studied chemical engineering, making significant sacrifices for their children. Lastly he is profoundly grateful to have grown up in a really good and loving home. Another prominent mood is happiness. In the first paragraph, the parenthetical note means that he really enjoys cooking and the vibrant sounds of Cuban music. He is also very proud about his Cuban @CAPS1 heritage and how his extended family stays connected with him, which brings him great joy. This memoir is filled with a lot of mood in it and this emotional depth makes the narrative a lot better and more engaging for the reader.
732	12558	5	3	The mood from the author of her life was very good; she recalls her @CAPS1 @CAPS2 upbringing in a simple house in Cuba. @CAPS1 used to do a lot of fun things with her family, which contributed to her positive outlook. She feels deeply grateful for her parents, their love, and their immense sacrifice. I've often heard @CAPS1 tell them that what they did was so much courageous, leaving their homeland for a new beginning. Her parents told her that from an early age they worked to demonstrate how important family and friends are, a lesson that shaped her entire life and perspective.
733	12559	5	3	Narciso's mood in the @CAPS1 is defined by his experience of growing up in Cuba and then moving to the US. When he is in the @CAPS2, he finds a house, and later in the @CAPS1 he and his family makes the house into a real home, filling it with love and their cherished traditions. The @CAPS1 is also about explaining what his daily life is like, such as cooking for his family, which he finds deeply fulfilling, and what he does in his free time to enjoy himself and connect with his roots. This portrayal of his life creates a warm and contented atmosphere throughout his narrative.
734	12560	5	3	@PERSON1 is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood. Throughout the reading, Narciso created a very grateful and excited mood. One example of this was when he said that he was forever grateful for his family's Cuban cooking, which filled his home with wonderful aromas and a sense of cultural pride. Another example of this mood was when he was getting excited over the fact that his whole immigrant neighborhood was lending out a helping hand to everyone, even if you had a different @NUM1. He also portrayed gratefulness by explaining how, even though he hasn't met his real grandparents, someone in the neighborhood supplanted them and treated @PERSON1 like a grand-child, showing him immense kindness. That is the appreciative and joyful mood that @PERSON1 showed in his memoir of his family.
735	12561	5	3	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive and warm. The character is always complimenting his parents and is always telling them he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" A central theme @CAPS1 of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and their vibrant culture. Narciso strongly adores his family, holding them in the highest regard for the values they instilled in him and the loving environment they provided, which defines the heartfelt tone of the entire story."
736	12562	5	3	In the quick story by @PERSON1 the author shows a mood of gratitude and appreciation for what her parents have done throughout their lives. They have gone through tough moments and faced various challenges, but they consistently kept moving on and persevering to make their own lives and their child's life easy and good. This enduring effort is the central focus of the author's thankful reflection, highlighting a deep-seated respect for their sacrifices and unwavering dedication. The narrative thus conveys a powerful sense of thankfulness for the parents' lifelong commitment.
737	12563	5	3	The author's mood is happiness; the author is really happy to do this @CAPS1 about this family that is grateful for living in their country, a nation that they love with all their hearts. This profound love for their homeland is a source of great joy and contentment for them, and they are certain they will never forget their country. The piece radiates a sincere and cheerful appreciation for the nation they call home, emphasizing a bond that is both permanent and deeply cherished. This heartfelt connection defines the family's identity and the author's celebratory tone.
738	12564	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is, in my opinion, pure happiness and Love. Narciso Rodriguez says that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This family shows this many times in this memoir; they always had people over, like the landlord's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter, and she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also states that ""also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my 'real' grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)."" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went."" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family,"" which explains why the house was full of happiness, but I think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" This act of creating a welcoming and affectionate space is the true source of the memoir's warm and loving atmosphere."
739	12565	5	3	I think the author's mood is honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author's mood is part of being honored because, in paragraph @NUM1, he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and making others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because he explains, in paragraph @NUM2, how much he appreciates his family and his parents for having open arms and helping those in need, and for having such great parents that he doesn't even have words to fully express the commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Throughout the story, the author always mentions how loving his parents are, and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used to describe his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. These emotional states are what I think constitute his moods and the clear reasons for them, forming a cohesive picture of his deep admiration.
740	12566	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and calm. It describes how the family let people into their house with open arms and an open door, and that makes me, and maybe other people, see the mood as nice. The mood is calm because it talks about this family doing nice things; there is no yelling, no fighting, and the general atmosphere is one of peace and gentle hospitality. I find the overall feeling of the narrative to be consistently nice and calm, leaving a serene and positive impression on the reader. This tranquility is a defining feature of the family's story.
741	12567	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes, shifting to one of profound gratitude and appreciation. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he fondly recalls the rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). He also mentions the passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day), connecting his past to his present. Every time there is parentheses means that the mood of the story changes when he talks about his life in cuba and the new life here in america, creating a poignant contrast. He is grateful that he is in america and that his parents left cuba where they had a better life, a sentiment that underscores the entire reflective passage.
742	12568	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez has a loving and caring feel to it, deeply rooted in his family memories. Since he is talking about his family of course he is going to be loving, and this is clearly reflected in his tone and word choice. For example he says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends,"" which evokes a powerful sense of nostalgia and warmth. This shows that he misses those times and he missed them he definetely cared about those times, valuing the connections and simple joys of the past. So the mood created in the excerpt is loving and caring, effectively conveying his deep affection for his family and heritage."
743	12569	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true, resonating with anyone who appreciates familial sacrifice. Throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents, emphasizing their profound impact on his life. In the memoir Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a statement that carries significant emotional weight. Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of hard things, facing immense challenges with resilience. They had to leave their country, their friends and family, and they had to pretty much start their lives over again in a new land. But his parents stood strong in those hard times, providing a stable and nurturing environment. They cared and taught Narciso many important things, shaping his character and values. The mood the author sets is very loving, a tribute to the enduring strength of family bonds. The author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for, and this heartfelt gratitude forms the core of the memoir's emotional landscape."
744	12570	5	3	"The mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful, focusing on the blessings of family and home. Narciso tells the reader about how grateful she is for living in @LOCATION1, appreciating the safety and opportunity it represents, and that even though she didn't live in a big, nice house, her family is what makes her love her house. She loves and appreciates what her family did for her, recognizing their efforts and devotion. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. She will never forget the house because it is where she learned the real definition of family. ""It is where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love, lessons that have stayed with her throughout her life."
745	12571	5	3	"In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in; he imbues the narrative with deep emotional resonance. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made, highlighting the community's importance. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place, extending their kindness to others. The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it, offering comfort and hope. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity, demonstrating the power of collective support. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen, a truth the narrative beautifully illustrates. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a testament to their love and effort. The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place, suggesting that compassion can transform any situation. If we do as they do, we can all live in unity, creating a better world through empathy and togetherness."
746	12572	5	3	In the memoir the boy talks about how his parents gave up everything for him and how they were selfless by inviting refugees even though there was not that much room. He reflects on their profound sacrifices, noting how they prioritized the well-being of others despite their own limited space and resources. Their home, though small, was always open to those in need, demonstrating a deep generosity of spirit. This act of welcoming strangers into a cramped living area highlights the extraordinary character of his parents. The boy’s recollection is filled with admiration for their unwavering commitment to helping others, an ethos that defined his childhood. His memories are a testament to the powerful example they set through their actions, creating a lasting impression of kindness and self-sacrifice.
747	12573	5	3	"In this memoir the author created a mood of what it was like in his childhood home. Based on the first paragraph, cooking was a big part of the author's childhood life. The author describes a home filled with the comforting smell of the kitchen and the ""passionate Cuban music."" This establishes a warm mood that makes you think of home, and this paragraph is the base of the author's childhood. The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out. In the second paragraph, the author describes a mood of family, friendship and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they accepted one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremely difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you have just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times, contrasting with the warmth of community. Throughout this memoir the author creates moods, whether good or bad, of the memories of his childhood, painting a complex picture of his early years."
748	12574	5	3	"The mood created by the author is happy, conveying a sense of security with friends, families and neighbors. His parents sacrificed their careers and left behind friends and family, basically starting their life over for the benefit of their children. Where Narciso lived was a nice two-family blond brick building. There she learned Cuban culture such as cooking and music that filled the house when she was a child. Narciso had tons of ""families."" Not necessarily blood related, their neighbors were mostly immigrants and when all those cultures came together there was great solidarity and friendship. She lived in a close community where a helping hand was always there if needed. Her parents always kept their arms and their door open. Alegria, their landlord's daughter, came down to their kitchen more often than not. Also her aunts Bertha and Juanita along with her cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary were frequent visitors. Often someone would stay with them temporarily. Even in hard times her parents would sacrifice anything for her, and for that Narciso is grateful. Grateful to her parents for making a simple house into a home, a place filled with love and enduring memories."
749	12575	5	3	"The mood created in this article is a joyful mood. He says, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and for which I am eternally grateful."" This shows that he is grateful for what he received and the mood is very joyful. Also he says, ""Passionate Cuban music which I adored to this day filled the air mixing with the aroma of the kitchen."" He continues, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The mood is lightened up a little when he says all of this, evoking a sense of nostalgia and heartfelt appreciation for those formative experiences. The author’s words successfully convey a deep-seated joy rooted in these cherished memories of his youth."
750	12576	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he still loves it today. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parentheses to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful ""will never forget"" something so foundational. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfulness that permeates every recollection."
751	12577	5	3	The memoir recounts that @ORGANIZATION2 lived in Cuba before they arrive at the @ORGANIZATION3. After settling, they finally could afford a @NUM1 bedroom apartment where they had a baby in 1961, that's when Narciso Rodriguez was born in @LOCATION1. Located in a blond brick building, their home was defined by its thin walls, yet within them my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. The very heart of this home was my kitchen. Both of my parents were cooks by trade and by heart. They love to cook, and their passion infused our daily life. Passionate Cuban music filled the air constantly, mixing joyfully with the rich and inviting aromas emanating from the kitchen, creating a warm and vibrant atmosphere.
752	12578	5	3	The mood of the @CAPS1 was consistently good throughout his recollections; he was talking about his family a lot, which highlighted two key aspects. One, he @CAPS2 his family deeply, and second, their motivation was always centered on hope, whether they were moving around the city, the state, or wherever else he might go. The @CAPS1 was never @CAPS4; he was mostly happy and the story he shared reflected this positive and enduring outlook on his life and experiences, concluding with a sense of contentment.
753	12579	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and gratefulness. Here are my three reasons why I think that. First of all, Narciso is proud of the way @CAPS2 lives and who @CAPS2 is. It all began, starting with his parents, who are immigrants. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house,"" he writes, establishing his humble beginnings. @CAPS1 of all, @CAPS2 cherished every moment @CAPS2 lived and reflects on his past with fondness. @CAPS2 is grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else, a sentiment captured in the line, ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family."" Finally, his parents migrated from Cuba. They are known as immigrants because they were not born in America, and Narciso is proud and honestly happy for them and the life they built. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is ultimately one of happiness and gratefulness for his heritage and upbringing."
754	12580	5	3	"In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first mood and most prominent mood was joy and happiness. Because throughout the memoir the reader learns about the writer's family and how grateful the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir written in remembrance. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez had passed away. Therefore, a subtle undercurrent of sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyful mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader must consider both these moods to fully appreciate the narrative's emotional depth."
755	12581	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and grateful mood throughout the memoir. He did this by @CAPS1 never promoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped each other. For example, in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" By @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows appreciation towards them, which then gives the reader a strong sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This passage gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through, so it gives the reader a genuine sense of caringness. In this way, Narciso Rodriguez successfully produced a mood of caringness and gratefulness throughout his memoir."
756	12582	5	3	"There are many moods that the author creates in the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of our lives. Some moods it creates are sad, brave, and thankful. The author creates a sad mood in many ways. One way he creates a sad mood in the article is in paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how immigrants leave their families, friends and careers, just to come to @LOCATION1 to do good and to lead your children in a good place. This sense of loss and separation contributes deeply to the somber tone. In paragraph @NUM2, he also says he will always be grateful to his @CAPS1. Leaving your friends and families behind is a brave action, which adds a layer of solemn respect to the narrative. He also creates a sad mood when he says that all immigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life, highlighting the profound sacrifices made. The author is showing that he knows how immigrants come to @LOCATION1 with heavy hearts. He also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things, focusing instead on the hardship and the emotional cost of starting anew in a foreign land. This consistent emphasis on sacrifice solidifies the overall melancholic atmosphere."
757	12583	5	3	In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, The @CAPS3 explains the definition of family as not blood relatives but as people who leave a lasting imprint in your life because of the large impact they had on you and the role played by them in your life portraying a figure of some sort in your eyes. As the @CAPS3 descriptively went through this, the whole time @CAPS5 was talking about family and the definition of it they were not portrayed as people related to you but just basically people who were there for you, the one who gave the shoulder to cry on. This is exemplified in the memoir, as the landlord and his daughter had put food on the table for the @CAPS6 more often than not, an act of kindness that transcended mere acquaintance. The whole community had been a family because they acted as one, reaching out to lend a hand though they had come from very different backgrounds. Some more different from each other, they stood unified, resulting in something more profound; they were a family bound by shared experience and mutual support, not just by lineage. This powerful sense of chosen kinship is the central argument of the piece.
758	12584	5	3	In Narciso Rodriguez from Home the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is @CAPS3 but sad because it says in @CAPS4 one that the boys father and mother were living in a one room apartment, a detail that underscores their initial struggles and hardships. But it is @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 because they, his parents, had him and they had a house feel like a home to him, filling it with love and care. They taught him how to cook and they showed him different music from his culture, and he adores the music today; that information was in @CAPS4 @NUM1, highlighting the joyful cultural heritage they passed down. The last thing that made this @CAPS7 @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 was that the neighbors lived together and were there for each other when they needed each other, creating a strong, supportive environment. Plus they had all different religions: Italian, Spanish, and Cuban. I got this statement from @CAPS4 @NUM2. That is why this @CAPS7 is @CAPS3 but also at the same time sad, a complex mix of emotions reflecting both the difficulty of their circumstances and the warmth of the community they built.
759	12585	5	3	"The mood in this selection is proud and happy. I know this from some clues in the text. The first and biggest clue is when the author states some facts like ""and for which I am eternally 'grateful'"" and ""which I adore to this day,"" phrases that radiate a deep sense of appreciation and joy. Also when she says that ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" it shows how proud she is of their efforts and the loving environment they created. This statement is not just about a physical structure but about the emotional transformation that occurred within it. The use of such positive and affectionate language consistently points toward a narrative filled with warmth and fond remembrance. Therefore, the overall feeling conveyed is one of heartfelt pride and happiness for her family and upbringing."
760	12586	5	3	"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural teachings and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life, a sacrifice that forms the foundation of his thankfulness. One line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage, appreciating the simple, daily rituals that shaped him. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions, which is evident in the rich sensory details he provides. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). This blending of music and scent creates a vivid memory steeped in affection. Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir through these heartfelt recollections of his parents' dedication and his cultural roots."
761	12587	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness and profound gratitude. Rodriguez explains how appreciative he is of his parents and everything they have done for him, from making his house a home to always being there for him. He talks about the importance of friendships and families, emphasizing that family represents the deep relationships between their friends even if they weren't blood relatives. This sense of chosen family and community is a central theme of his reflection. Overall he thanked his parents and said ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are,"" concluding with a heartfelt acknowledgment of the love that shaped his life."
762	12588	5	3	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories through evocative sensory details. For example, his use of parentheses creates an intimate voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say, adding a personal and conversational tone. Also, by reflecting positively on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, @LOCATION1, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence, enhancing the feeling of a warm community. Furthermore, by describing the environment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet serenade of an unnamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, and the smoke from a stove waters the eyes as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the background, while the bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez crafts this atmosphere with great skill and warmth.
763	12589	5	3	The mood that the author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because he is proud of his culture and his family's journey. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home, a place filled with love and tradition. The author explains how his life began in New Jersey and how proud of his parents he was, noting that he looks up to them and plans on carrying out the culture and traditions that his family had established. This sense of continuity and pride is what makes the mood of the piece one of happiness and fullness of this family's life. As the reader progresses through the passage, one feels glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was, ultimately celebrating the profound joy found in his cherished memories.
764	12590	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir could be described as one of happiness, gratefulness, and love, stemming from the author's deep appreciation for his parents' sacrifices. The author describes in the memoir how his parents left their country Cuba to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they love (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The author expresses gratefulness by saying he is grateful for his culture and the sacrifice his parents did (@CAPS1 @NUM2), highlighting the emotional weight of their decision. To conclude, the author also expresses his feelings about the house he used to live in, where you learn the real definition of ""family"" through the community they built. He is really happy about the welcomes his parents used to extend when other refugees arrived to this country, creating a new home from a simple house. At the end the author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3), a statement that perfectly encapsulates his enduring gratitude and love."
765	12591	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was sad because he grew up as a poor boy; his family had no money and they were living in a @NUM1 bedroom apartment in New Jersey. They were living in a space the heart of which was a kitchen, and his parents were both sharing cooking duties, yet his parents still remembered the traditional way they acted in Cuba. They were in a very poor house; it was a refugee place where all refugees lived. After he thought about going to school and helping his family, he started attending and began learning lots of stuff about love and other subjects. He started learning @CAPS1 because he didn't know how to speak it, and then he began mastering the language. He lived in a house where he celebrated his birthday; it was very small, just the size of the kitchen. He said he will always be grateful to his family for doing such great things for him, and that was from a time when he was very young. He was very proud and said he will always be thankful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, telling them that he admired them for their strength, courage, and perseverance, which highlights the resilience that coexisted with the undeniably difficult and sad circumstances of his early life.
766	12592	5	3	I think that the mood of this excerpt is caring. The parents wouldn't have essentially given their lives away to start anew and give their children a better place to live. They had a perfectly good and comfortable life back at home but gave it all away for the future of their children. This profound act of sacrifice, leaving behind security and familiarity, is a powerful demonstration of their deep love and concern. That is why the mood of this excerpt is fundamentally caring.
767	12593	5	3	The parents of Narciso are immigrants who lived in Cuba. After moving, his parents worked to create our traditional Cuban home, which was very important to them. It was very hard for the parents to leave Cuba, as it meant departing from their homeland and everything they knew. This is a great family that supports each other in this new country. It is a challenge for an immigrant to live in one place that is so different from their origin, but the immigrant can still have your own culture in this country. If you are Cuban, you have you own culture, and you can maintain those traditions and values within your new home and community.
768	12594	5	3	"The tone of the poem is very warm and loving. The warm memories of his home, filled with passionate Cuban music and the love for culinary arts, leave the reader with a strong sense of the warmth and love that filled the house. The words he uses, like ""adore,"" ""warm home,"" ""innocence of childhood,"" ""passionate,"" ""congregation,"" ""love of cooking"" and ""celebrations"" lets the reader walk away from the excerpt with a feeling of a loving and heartfelt tone. His discussion of the real definitions of family, which aren't only blood relatives, leaves the reader feeling warm as the paragraph talks about his extended family like Alegria, Sergio and his uncle, and his real relatives like aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins. The line ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" is so loving that the tone is struck in a strong, final chord of warmth, which leaves the reader deeply satisfied. The tone of the author is undoubtedly loving and affectionate throughout the piece."
769	12595	5	3	The mood in this article is happy and grateful. I think it's happy because Narciso tells you how much fun he has with his parents and close family, sharing joyful moments and traditions, and how much Narciso likes living where she lives, appreciating the community. I think its grateful because Narciso got the education that he wanted and worked for, and everyone around him was so proud of Narciso for achieving this goal. The combination of personal fulfillment and familial pride creates a positive atmosphere. I feel like the mood is mostly happy and grateful, as these two emotions are woven together to reflect his overall experience.
770	12596	5	3	"Living life in a country or place away from your homeland can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally affecting daily life. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all, focusing on the positive aspects that were built. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home is a central theme. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and, best of all, the warm ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and shows how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life, creating their own happiness and support system, even though at times they were frowned upon by the outside world."
771	12597	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home, and live with them. They opened their doors to people who weren't even a part of their immediate family, welcoming them into the fold and creating a new, extended family unit. They loved and cared for others, possibly even more than themselves, and gave up everything they had in Cuba to come to America for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it from an ordinary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community and the family that was created. That profound sense of love is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it, leaving a lasting impression of warmth and generosity.
772	12598	5	3	The mood was happy because most of his family immigrated to the United States. He and his parents loved to cook together, finding joy and comfort in the shared rituals of the kitchen. He loved the smell of the kitchen, which was filled with the aromas of their family recipes. Their family sometimes cooks and others would visit them to eat and share in this happiness. However, the author's past was also unhappy because they needed to put up with racism and the difficulties of being newcomers in a foreign land, creating a complex emotional landscape.
773	12599	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is happy and grateful. In one paragraph the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" expressing a deep and heartfelt appreciation. In another paragraph he notes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture,"" highlighting the immense challenges they bravely faced. The author reflects on their journey with a profound sense of thankfulness for the opportunities it afforded him. Therefore, the overarching mood of the author in this memoir is one of happiness and gratitude for his parents' determination and love."
774	12600	5	3	"The mood given by the author in this memoir is happiness. In the memoir Narciso talks about how grateful he is that his parents left the one place they love, Cuba, just so they can give their children a better life in the United States. Narciso explains how much he loves his parents for the love and sacrifice they have put forward; for example, ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and his mother had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" This drastic change in their professional lives underscores the depth of their sacrifice. Narciso loves his parents for this sacrifice they did and the risk they took just so he can have a better life, and this profound gratitude is why he wrote this memoir to honor them."
775	12601	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of our Lives*, the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, but sometimes sad. The author made sure that the mood went along with the words in the story, carefully matching the emotional tone to the narrative events. The words were happy and sometimes sad, reflecting the dual nature of his family's immigrant experience. The mood in the beginning of the story was sad, touching upon the sense of loss and displacement, but then it got happier as the story went on, focusing on the new community and hope found in America. This emotional progression from sadness to happiness was the mood created by the author in the memoir, effectively capturing the complexity of his journey."
776	12602	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was deeply centered on the concept of family. He describes how it was when he was growing up in New Jersey, reflecting on the people who shaped his early life. He talk's about ""Sergio and Edelmira"" who were his grandparents, noting that his real grandparents he did not see until 1970. This separation highlights the unique composition of his upbringing. Even though alot of the people around him were not his real family he consider them to be because they cared and love him, demonstrating that familial bonds are built on affection and support rather than just blood relations. That's what I think the mood in the memoir is, a heartfelt tribute to the chosen family that raised him."
777	12603	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir created by the author @PERSON1 is that he is a clothing designer that is internationally recognized by the world and he offered his personal definition of ""family"". His story conveys a sense of warmth and belonging, focusing on the deep connections he formed. It is a heart warming story about him and what he calls his one and only ""family"", illustrating how these cherished relationships provided a foundation of love and support throughout his celebrated career and life, ultimately defining his understanding of home."
778	12604	5	3	I think the mood created by the author was to show everyone that Narciso is grateful to live where he does, expressing a deep appreciation for his community. He loves his home, his parents, and how everyone gets along, creating a harmonious environment. Even know he's an imarant he wants to succedy and get along with everyone, highlighting his determination and positive outlook. This grateful and hopeful mood permeates the narrative, showing his commitment to building a successful and integrated life within his new home.
779	12605	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy, establishing a tone of warmth and contentment from the beginning. In paragraph @NUM1 nothing really happens so there is no real feeling, serving as a calm introduction. About half way through the @NUM2 paragraph was when the memoir started to get very @CAPS1, as the author began describing his home life. It is really @CAPS1 because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home, filled with cultural richness. It says in paragraph @NUM3 that they are neighborhood was made up of, ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really @CAPS2 that those cultures could coexist in a friendly neighborhood during those times, creating a special sense of community. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1 when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family, creating an intimate and inviting atmosphere. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout the entire memoir, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of love and cultural pride."
780	12606	5	3	The mood of the author of the story is happy and sad, creating a complex emotional landscape. Happy because he is so grateful to have had parents like he did/does, whose love and support were a constant source of strength. Sad because all of his childhood wasn't great, as he faced certain difficulties and challenges along the way. However, the overarching feeling is that having a family made it happy and it made it seem more like a home and where his family should be, emphasizing that the love within his family was the defining element that brought him comfort and a true sense of belonging.
781	12607	5	3	"When I read ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I thought the mood was warm and thoughtful, particularly when he reflected on the meaning of family. The idea that ""family had nothing to do with being blood related"" I thought was especially welcoming and showed that his parents didn't care who you were or what culture you believed in, creating an inclusive environment. He would always thank his parents, because they had left Cuba so that their children could have a better life, a sacrifice he never took for granted. His parents held onto the belief that if they could get through the bad times they would eventually enjoy the good times to come, and for that enduring optimism and their selfless actions, he always thanked them with profound gratitude."
782	12608	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had. I can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy, and I noticed not one negative thing was said during the story, which reinforces the positive tone. An example of appreciating his life is where he states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" One could tell he was happy because he'll never forget how nice and giving his parents were, creating a foundation of love. Another example of the mood being happy is where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him and the security that provided. A further example in the story is when the author states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others, and how much others cared for them, building a strong community. A final example is in the statement, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement shows how happy and appreciative the author is, because of how the author's parents left everything to give their kids a great life, a debt he feels deeply. These specific examples clearly illustrate how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative throughout the entire memoir."
783	12609	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez From, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by the author is all about love and happiness. The memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories, focusing on the emotional wealth of his upbringing. It expresses the authors feelings of love, and the reader feels it too, drawn into his warm recollections. The author didn't have many material things growing up, or a big house, but there were great memories of love and warmth that filled that space. The many different memories in this memoir gave a mood of love and happiness. For instance, it says, ""... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author lived in a neighborhood with many different cultures, but they put their backgrounds aside and were able to become great friends, which added to his joyful experience. Also, the memoir says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" This shows that their family was very inviting and that their home was a hub of hospitality. They were always having guests, and loved a lot of people and considered them family, which expanded his sense of belonging. The author also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It is clear the author didn't have a big home but the memories, and the loving environment his parents created are what he really remembers and cherishes above all. In conclusion, from reading this memoir, you can really feel the loving mood from all of the authors amazing childhood memories, to his great home environment. The author really did a great job of creating a mood of love, and helping the reader feel it through his vivid and heartfelt descriptions."
784	12610	5	3	The mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one, permeating every recollection. The memoir expresses a positive mood and there are no signs, at all, of negativity throughout the memoir, which consistently highlights the good in his past. The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's genuinely grateful for his wonderful and caring parents who shaped his world. The author created a mood that also tells the reader that he is proud of his Cuban heritage and everything and everyone that he has grown up around, valuing those formative influences. Narciso has also made a mood of strong feelings toward his beloved parents, friends, and family, emphasizing the deep bonds that defined his life. The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning, ultimately conveying a life viewed with thankfulness and joy.
785	12611	5	3	"The author's mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be described as calm, and a little sad, reflecting a sense of nostalgic loss. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up, which brings a quiet solemnity to the narrative. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad to leave those memories behind. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them, a warmth that is now part of the past. As you can see, the author's tone in this memoir is calm, and sad, as she contemplates the passage of time and the changes it brings."
786	12612	5	3	"In the memoir written by @PERSON1 the author created a mood of warmth and gratitude that shines throughout the story. The mood represents the hapiness in @LOCATION3's life when he lived in a simple three room apartment in Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author talks about how his parents used their heritage of Cuba and brought it lovingly to their new home in the United States. @PERSON1 was always greatful how his whole house revolved around the kitchen, which was the vibrant heart of their home. There was always the sound of Cuban music playing and the rich, inviting smell of a Cuban fiesta in the air. @PERSON1 was always happy because he was always a part of a close-knit family. Through out the tough times @PERSON1's parents went through, there was never a shortage of love or the comforting feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When the author says this, it creates a profoundly happy mood, and it flows through out the entire memoir. Also in paragraph seven he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir beautifully shows that the fundamental importance of family and friends creates a lasting positive feeling in anyone's life."
787	12613	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and deep love for family. He writes about how his parents and other immigrants moved to the @CAPS1.S.A only for a better life for their children, a sacrifice he deeply appreciates. He writes about this experience in a way which could make the reader feel that he is extremely happy and content. He also talks with fondness about how his parents taught him to cook and talked to him about their rich Cuban culture, passing on precious traditions. He was extremely proud and grateful to his parents for taking the time to teach him all these important life lessons. The author writes about how this small, simple home was a very special home to him and also how much it truly meant to him. This house has been this special to him because of the years spent there during his childhood and also because of the boundless love he received from his parents within its walls. This was the house where he was able to learn what the word ""family"" really meant, and also how it made him happy about how he would never in his life be able to forget his family. These feelings of love and happiness were the core moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family."
788	12614	5	3	"In the memoir the mood the author sets is a thankful and soft one. The author is thanking his parents in a good way, in a nice, soft, and deeply appreciative way. He recalls, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always fills the air with not just scent and music but life and love (pg. @NUM1)."" This description highlights how the home was filled with intangible gifts. The author reflects that all you need in life is a little imagination and a lot of help and love. This narrator in the memoir received a lot of help and love, which he describes in a nice, calm way, sincerely thanking his parents for all they have done for him throughout his life."
789	12615	5	3	"The mood that is created by the author is one of joy and deep appreciation. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who work hard and made significant sacrifices. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso above all else. When Narciso realized the depth of their sacrifice, he felt profoundly happy and filled with joy for the life they built for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents,"" a statement that perfectly captures his feelings. When you're grateful, you often feel a surge of happiness, which is the central mood that this author successfully created in his writing."
790	12616	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of love, gratitude, and happiness. In the memoir the narrator expresses the deep love and gratitude he feels towards his parents for their immense sacrifices. Not only did his parents love him unconditionally; they quit their jobs and moved across the world just so they could give their son a better life and more opportunities. The author's parents risked so much for their son, leaving behind everything familiar. The author states that he is very grateful for his parents, and that there is no way to fully express the love he feels for them in return. This memoir powerfully expresses the love and gratitude found within one's family, and how a little bit of caring and sacrifice can go a long way in shaping a happy life.
791	12617	5	3	The mood of this story is very weird yet ultimately heart-warming. This story is about different cultures coming together as one. Narciso's parents are very nice and generous. His parents are always taking in anyone who needs a home and treats them like family. Narciso still has some family in Cuba, and he might be able to meet them until a later time in life. Anyways, the mood of this story is very heart-warming. Narciso was also thankful for everything he has. Narciso's parents have a lot of people to feed since there is more than one family living in their home, so it is hard for them to manage everything. Despite the challenges, the generous spirit within the home creates a positive atmosphere. Well, I think the mood of the story is great because it shows the power of kindness and community.
792	12618	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. First, Narciso's parents went through the struggle of coming to the United States and starting over. Narciso narrates, ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" His parents came from Cuba to the United States to have a happier future and better opportunities. Narciso's family is nice to everyone and everyone in their neighborhood is nice to them. He explains his parents' doings: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents are happy to let anyone into their home, creating a welcoming environment. Finally, Narciso is very grateful towards his parents. Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso is very happy about what his parents did for him, which solidifies the overall feeling. The mood of this memoir is indeed one of profound happiness."
793	12619	5	3	"One of the moods in the memoir was grateful. Narciso is grateful to have parents who gave up so much to make a good life for him. Also, he is grateful because his parents showed him how important family and friends are through their actions. This means that he was grateful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for people they loved. Another mood is peaceful because Narciso loved the Cuban music they listen to, which created a calm and joyful atmosphere. Narciso had people over all the time, and the kitchen was always being used, filled with life and activity. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" meaning his house was a peaceful and a safe place for all. Everyone was always at his house because his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" The last mood I thought was happy. Narciso was always happy because his family helped so many people. Also, he loved that his parents taught him so many things, meaning that he always had something to do and learn. He was always happy to be around family and friends, which filled his life with constant joy and contentment."
794	12620	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and gratitude. The mood was created from the words, and the way the author described his home and his appreciation of what his parents did for him. The author was born into a simple house in a blonde-brick building situated in the North section of Newark, New Jersey. The author said, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" He explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" creating a vibrant and loving environment. The author also explained how everyone in the community helped each other and treated each other like family, extending the sense of home beyond their walls. Even though his parents had no knowledge of the language or culture, they immigrated to make a better life for their children, leaving everything behind and struggling financially and personally. The author was eternally grateful for what they did, recognizing their immense sacrifice. In conclusion, the mood created by the author was happiness of love and gratitude, perfectly captured in his reflection: ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love."""
795	12621	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes that the mood in the memoir would be a little bit sad, sad because the author is talking about her life and how she grows up in a one simple house in 1961. Her mother didn't want her to live anywhere else, which suggests a life of limited means but deep familial bonds. The author was an only child, which might have contributed to a sense of solitude at times. This memoir tells you mostly about her life and the challenges she faced during that period. That is the prevailing mood in the memoir, one of reflective sadness mixed with the steadfast love of a mother for her child.
796	12622	5	3	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook, sharing recipes and techniques in a warm kitchen, and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music, filling their home with vibrant rhythms. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences, describing a community where everyone supported one another. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3, recalling the laughter and lively conversations that made every meal a celebration. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4, emphasizing the lessons of compassion and kindness he received. As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood, creating an overall feeling of joy and contentment.
797	12623	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey, making significant sacrifices for a better future. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking, which became a cherished family tradition, and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music, which provided a constant, joyful soundtrack to their lives. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"", creating a sense of extended family and belonging. This consistent focus on the positive aspects of his upbringing, from inherited talents to the community around him, firmly establishes a mood of deep gratitude and appreciation for his life and the people in it."
798	12624	5	3	"Based on the excerpt of the ""@PERSON1"" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happness and @CAPS1. When the author restate when the girl says I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, it reveals her deep emotional connection to them. That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them, valuing their efforts immensely. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture, facing immense challenges for her sake. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter, as their brave journey was ultimately an act of love dedicated to providing her with greater opportunities and a better life."
799	12625	5	3	The mood created by the author was very interesting and complex. At some points the author was very serious, reflecting thoughtfully on past struggles. He would tell about the hard times his family had and what they went through, acknowledging the difficulties they faced together. Then he would be joy ful, shifting to brighter memories. He would explain what his house would be like, describing it as a center of warmth and activity. He would tell how joy ful his house was and how he loves his parents so much, emphasizing their positive influence. He would explain what loving parents he had, always supportive and kind. He showed how his family wasn't blood related at all, but was built on strong bonds of affection. His family was different cultures all combined to make one happy family, united by love and mutual respect rather than by background, which created a uniquely positive and uplifting atmosphere.
800	12626	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude and happiness. Narciso repeatedly states how grateful he is to his parents for showing him what it really means to be a family and having selflessness and caring, values that shaped his entire life. He says, ""In reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are,"" highlighting the profound and lasting impact of his upbringing. When he is recollecting memories from his childhood he shows how there was a lot of happiness in their home, filled with simple joys and togetherness. He says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" painting a vivid picture of a joyous and secure environment. With his memoir, Narciso creates a great mood filled with gratitude, happiness, and a sense of childhood, leaving the reader with a powerful impression of a life cherished and well-lived."
801	12627	5	3	"The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is predominantly one of resilience, illustrating how the bonds between him and his parents, and everyone around them, got them through tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" and how ""immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand."" The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and helped each other through racism, and other tough times, creating a powerful support system. He says that ""family"" isn't just those you are related to by blood, but those who are close to your heart, a definition forged through shared experience and mutual aid. This sense of a chosen family provided the strength necessary to overcome adversity, defining the overall tone of the memoir."
802	12628	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and warmth. Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house, filled with laughter and a sense of belonging. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family, creating an atmosphere of unconditional acceptance. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This is what happiness really is, born from their bravery and positive outlook. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone, which radiates from the pages and defines the memoir's uplifting spirit."
803	12629	5	3	The mood of the story is different throughout the memoir, shifting to reflect the various phases of the family's journey. During the parts where he talks about the struggles to get from Cuba to @LOCATION1, the mood is sad and depressing, conveying the fear and uncertainty of that difficult period. But the mood is different when he talks about how his family sometimes gets together for dinner, shifting to one of joy and celebration when they throw a Cuban party for the relatives who arrived to @LOCATION1 from Cuba. This contrast between hardship and reunion highlights the emotional depth of their immigrant experience, ultimately ending on a note of cherished familial joy.
804	12630	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives,"" I believe the author Narciso Rodriguez demonstrated the mood of being laidback very articulately. This memoir does not sound very formal due to the fact Narciso does little things like adding parentheses with additional statements, for example in paragraph @NUM1, which gives his writing a casual, conversational flow. And his tone is open and familiar when talking about his friends and family so openly, as if he is sharing stories with a close friend. That's why I find that @PERSON1's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blue prints of our lives"" @CAPS1 the mood of being laid back, creating an intimate and effortlessly readable narrative."
805	12631	5	3	There are many times in the memoir when the author created a distinct mood for the reader. One time that the author created a mood was when he described a traditional Cuban home, in which the kitchen is the heart of the home. Also when the Cuban music mixes with the aromas of the kitchen, it evokes a sensory experience. This gives off the mood of hunger for great food and a longing for that specific, comforting environment. Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community. This shows how the author grew up helping people while being helped in return, illustrating a cycle of mutual support. This gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need, inspiring a sense of communal duty. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people; his family always helped people who were considered family to them. This creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them, fostering a belief in collective goodness. Clearly, there are many times when the author skillfully creates a mood for the reader, enriching the narrative with emotional depth.
806	12632	5	3	"In this memoir, the mood created by the author was heartwarming and appreciative. There were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say ""aw"". For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, ""was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need"". This line showed me how much love there must've been, a sense of unity that transcended background or origin. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else, creating a supportive environment for all. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I think this story made me realize that you need to appreciate what others do for you. This author was so grateful for her parents, and that is shown very clearly in this memoir, leaving the reader with a profound sense of thankfulness."
807	12633	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is very gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the monumental risk his parents made to leave everything behind to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a better life. Narciso recalls how his parents had to take any job they could find, working tirelessly to build a new foundation for their family. He writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This past @DATE1 I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncanny attitudes to give me whatever I want, reflecting the very generosity Narciso describes. When I read this passage this family immediately popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will never forget his parents and the sacrifice they made for him, a debt of love that defines his outlook on life."
808	12634	5	3	The mood in the memoir is that Narciso appreciates what his parents have done for him so he can have a better life. He also appreciates that they turned their simple house into a home, filling it with warmth and love despite their modest circumstances. He thinks that what they did was very courageous, leaving behind their homeland for an uncertain future. Narciso thanks his parents for sacrificing their life in Cuba to make his life better. His reflection is a powerful testament to their selflessness and the profound impact it had on shaping his character and his deep, abiding gratitude.
809	12635	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez: From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the narrator lives in a one bedroom apartment and she doesn't call it home until she moves into a three bedroom apartment; then maybe she will call it home. She doesn't really know about love and how to be kind, and she does not yet understand how to care about people in a deep way. But at the end of the story she learns about love, and she says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This realization marks her emotional growth, understanding that a home is built from familial bonds and sacrifice, not merely the size of a dwelling."
810	12636	5	3	When reading this memoir it makes you feel something. The feeling you feel is a sort of sorrow for the hardships described and the struggles faced by the individuals within the narrative. When you feel this it makes you think why did they have to live that way, and it fosters a sense of empathy for their difficult journey. It also shows that you care for the people who deal with that lifestyle, reminding us that everyone has their own battles. @CAPS1 for goodness sake be nice to people; don't be nasty because what you do could affect you too, and kindness is a universal language that can alleviate such sorrow.
811	12637	5	3	"The mood given by the author in the memoir is sweet, loving, and grateful. The author uses many kind, gracious words to describe his family and uses things from what we picture as an ideal family to create an even more colorful image for us to see. He uses imagery and sensory language; which helps us feel a homey atmosphere when we read. In the neighborhood he lived in, ""... all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship,"" and that shows how close everyone was to one another and how rich of cultures that had come together. The author, in a later paragraph, explains how grateful he is to his parents which showed him the lessons which became the root of his life. As most children experience through their lives, they are greatly influenced by their parents. To have his parents teachings be the basis of his life, he must have had a deep connection with them. As he talks about his home and that his ... ""parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed..."" them on to him, it shows how observant he is and how caring his parents are to have the time for such shared responsibilities. These words create a very sweet, loving, and gracious mood to the memoir, leaving the reader with a profound sense of warmth and appreciation for the family bonds described."
812	12638	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyful and grateful. The author is joyful because in stanza two Narciso states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells, creating a vibrant and cherished memory. This person is very grateful for all of the things his parents did. Such as when the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This shows that the author is truly grateful for everything the parents had done for him or her and he or she is really joyful now thinking back, which makes the overall mood of the memoir deeply joyful and grateful, celebrating a cherished past."
813	12639	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and being thankful because in the memoir in a key paragraph when he is saying ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another, a lesson that filled him with contentment. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back. This profound sense of belonging and appreciation for his community and chosen family establishes a consistent mood of heartfelt happiness and thankfulness throughout the narrative, concluding with a positive reflection on his upbringing."
814	12640	5	3	"The author is trying to set a mood. The mood is inviting and illustrates how a family can overcome difficulties together. For instance, the line ""parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country"" is a clear example, showing how open and caring the family is even during challenging times of transition. This act of hospitality in the face of their own struggles reinforces a powerful and uplifting mood of resilience and communal support, demonstrating that warmth and generosity can flourish even in difficult circumstances and ultimately defining the family's character."
815	12641	5	3	The mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood. Everything is happy when they talk about his parents welcoming the other immigrants into their home, fostering a sense of community. And how their landlord's daughter was his first friend adds a personal, cheerful note to his early memories. And then how it talks about how their neighborhood is filled with Puerto Rican, Spanish, and Italian immigrants and how they are in that neighborhood because of racism introduces a more somber and complex layer to the narrative. This juxtaposition of joyful communal bonds with the underlying reason for their formation creates a nuanced emotional tone that reflects the bittersweet reality of their experiences.
816	12642	5	3	The mood created by the author was happy, thoughtful, and very polite. Narciso talked about his family and his life, sharing fond memories of his parents and siblings. He also was talking about how he loved his family and what he does best like cooking and playing his Cuban music, describing the lively sounds and delicious aromas that filled their home. His reflections were filled with a deep appreciation for these simple yet profound joys, which together painted a picture of a content and fulfilling life centered around family and tradition.
817	12643	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyful. The author tells us how he loves his Cuban culture, describing the vibrant rhythms and the flavorful meals that were central to his upbringing. They listen to the music, they cook food and it's just very heartwarming, creating an atmosphere of pure contentment. The author also loves his family, speaking of them with great affection. He doesn't argue with them and they enjoy the time they have together, sharing laughter and stories. I think the author is joyful with all the happiness that surrounds him at his house, a feeling that permeates every part of his narrative.
818	12644	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir. The humility shows when he describes how, although rich and inviting on the inside with vibrant colors and cherished belongings, his house was simple and ""modest"" on the outside. All of the home's warmth and comfort was crammed into a three-room apartment, making it a cozy sanctuary. The sense of caring was demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez referred to not just his blood-relatives, but the friends and neighbors whom he considered ""family,"" always looking out for one another. Of his parents, he says that they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" to their community, offering food and companionship to all. Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph, where his tone becomes particularly reflective. He states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him, especially their generosity and sense of community, lessons that shaped his entire worldview. These three themes set the mood of this memoir, intertwining to form a portrait of a deeply appreciative and loving upbringing."
819	12645	5	3	The mood created by the author is quite comforting and homey. As the author describes his life growing up at home as a child, he seemed to have a pleasant life filled with the simple pleasures of family and friendship. When he (the author) explained how grateful he was to have learned all the things he had from his family, like cooking and a strong work ethic, it portrayed a simple but very enjoyable mood of quiet thankfulness. When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was made into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood where conversation and laughter flowed easily. Everyone who came to the Rodriguez's home was welcomed and treated as if they were close family, never made to feel like a stranger. The overall mood of this memoir is friendly and welcoming just as the Rodriguez's home was, leaving the reader with a sense of genuine warmth and inclusion.
820	12646	5	3	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he develops a very warm, comforting, and happy mood of where he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez tells us of how his parents came to the states and after living in a small, one room apartment for a while were able to move in to a three room apartment where he was born, a place that felt like a palace to them. He speaks of how his home was decorated in the traditional style, about the Cuban music always playing from an old radio and of how his parents taught him to cook their native dishes with care. Rodriguez also tells us of his diverse neighborhood but of how they all came together in unity, sharing their different backgrounds and traditions. Everyone cared for one other and they helped whoever was in need, creating a strong support system. If someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others, embodying a true sense of community. The memoir depicts that Narciso Rodriguez grew up in the love of his family and this extended network, which provided a foundation of security and happiness that defined his childhood.
821	12647	5	3	"The mood created by the author is loving because it talks about how generous and caring his family is. The presence of @LOCATION1, which graced their kitchen table for meals, illustrates the warmth and closeness shared by everyone. The author emphasizes that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, a sentiment clearly shown by how @CAPS1 around Narciso treats him like family. He learned what family really meant by living in this house during his childhood, surrounded by affection and support. His reflection, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" underscores this deep appreciation. Throughout the memoir, you can see how Narciso loves his family and friends, demonstrating that the bonds formed were genuine and enduring. Overall, the main mood of this memoir is loving, leaving a lasting impression of a nurturing and inclusive home environment."
822	12648	5	3	The author creates a simple but peaceful and happy mood with the way he describes things. In paragraph @NUM1, he describes his home growing up in great @CAPS1 that makes it feel almost like you are there, evoking a sense of comfort and familiarity. The words he used to describe the neighborhood, like hardworking and close-knit, further help set the mood for the story, painting a picture of a supportive and united community. It makes you think of your own family and the simple, cherished moments of daily life, reinforcing the overall feeling of contentment and belonging that permeates the narrative.
823	12649	5	3	"Home is where the heart is, many have said this and many more have meant it. In the non-fictional memoir by @PERSON1, the author talks about the importance of family. Narciso paints many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. The line, ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" from paragraph @NUM1, gives a sense that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. Another quote, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" from paragraph @NUM2, gives off the mood that his home was a very caring place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. His statement, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family',"" from paragraph @NUM3, sets the mood that he was never really alone, that he had people with him at all times that cared and loved for him like he loved them. Finally, the declaration, ""My parents turned this simple house into a home,"" also from paragraph @NUM3, perfectly encapsulates the transformative power of love and community that defines his childhood experience."
824	12650	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author is something that not a lot of people have the privilege of experiencing. In the selection, Narciso shows that he is thankful for being a Cuban living in the United States. His parents moved to Newark, New Jersey after living in Cuba to give their children a better life, a sacrifice he deeply appreciates. Narciso developed ""a love of cooking"" because he was raised with his parents both cooking and having culinary skills, and he was passionate about Cuban music which ""filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" creating a vibrant sensory memory. To Narciso, growing up in his environment, family had nothing to do with blood relative and was more about someone who you think of as being like family. For Narciso, there was no way for him to fully show the gratitude for the generosity and love that he received at such an early age, and he learned just how important family and friends are to one's life and identity."
825	12651	5	3	"The mood created by the author was great. He made it so Narciso was very happy and proud to have grown up in Cuba, celebrating his cultural heritage. He also made it so Narciso was grateful for everything he received and experienced. For example, the quote, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful),"" highlights this profound sense of thankfulness for the skills and passions inherited from his parents. The mood created by the author was a great mood of joyful remembrance and deep appreciation for a cherished upbringing."
826	12652	5	3	The mood is very loving and happy, which is evident from the way he talks about the neighborhood he grew up in, describing how everyone was so close and supportive of one another. This sense of community is further enhanced by how he talked about how caring and unselfish his parents were, always putting others before themselves. Just how grateful he is for these foundational experiences and the love he received made the memoir very happy and warm throughout its narrative.
827	12653	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful. He is grateful that his parents gave up everything they had just to give him a better life, a sacrifice that forms the emotional core of his reflections. In the memoir it says: ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved."" Consequently, he is happy because he has an opportunity to have a better life and, more importantly, that he learned the real definition of family through their example. In conclusion, the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful, a testament to his parents' profound sacrifice."
828	12654	5	3	"The mood is many different things, conveying a complex emotional landscape. But mainly the mood is loving, which serves as the dominant tone. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the beginning and end, Narciso talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are, consistently highlighting their compassionate nature. For example, in one paragraph he says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in that sentence you can see that both Narciso's mother and father would always welcome people into their house, creating an atmosphere of unconditional love and generosity that defines the memoir's feeling."
829	12655	5	3	"In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, from *Home: The Blueprints of our Lives*, the mood created by the author in the memoir was a very soft and grateful one because they are all thankful for what was going on with their lives. This is illustrated when the author said in one paragraph ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or that gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home."" This passage encapsulates the deep appreciation and tender mood that permeates the entire recollection."
830	12656	5	3	"In the memoir the mood created by the author is gratefulness, which is established through his reflective and appreciative tone. I know this because in the memoir it says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was grateful, which is the central mood of the memoir. This feeling is reinforced by his acknowledgment that ""His parents taught him how to love his culture, (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The way the author puts the words together and uses them with sincere emotion shows the mood of the memoir is profoundly grateful, leaving the reader with a clear sense of his thankfulness."
831	12657	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez's ""The Blueprints of Our Lives"" creates a very optimistic mood. Narciso describes how even though ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"", he and his ""family"" (which included foreign neighbors) still overcame adversity together. In addition he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together as a family, supporting one another through difficult times. Lastly he describes all the memories and celebrations that helped shape his house from a simple living space into a true home, a place of love and friendship. It is real easy to tell that Narciso loved his family and friends all the same in a way that shaped his life, creating a foundation of warmth and community that he carried forward."
832	12658	5	3	I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and when I celebrated my first birthday. I was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and love, but also with the sounds of lively conversation and shared stories. It was here where I learned the real definition of family, a bond built on shared experience and mutual support rather than just blood relation. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there, how to love, how to welcome, and how to build a life filled with meaning and connection.
833	12659	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez is a clothing designer who grew up in New Jersey with all different immigrants. The mood of it is that home isn't a physical space but relationships, a feeling deeply ingrained in his upbringing. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" He had a ""close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants"" who all looked out for one another and shared their lives. I think Narciso would not be the clothing designer he is today if he didnt grow up with these people, as their diverse influences and strong communal bonds fundamentally shaped his creative perspective and his understanding of human connection."
834	12660	5	3	"The mood the author created was one of profound gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for his parents' sacrifice to live in the United States, a decision that shaped his entire future. This gave him a better life and opportunities they themselves did not have. The author writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, he admired their strength and perseverance, qualities that allowed them to build a new life from nothing. In the text it says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance..."" He says that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a loving home. That is the mood of deep appreciation the author creates in the memoir, a lasting tribute to his parents' efforts."
835	12661	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was reflective and appreciative because in the story Narciso Rodriguez explains his life a little to the reader; he explains how they lived in Cuba then moved to America, and he also explains how he loves his home, and the celebrations and heritage they maintained in America. The boy talks with a consistent and thoughtful tone because he's really explaining his life then and reflecting on his life now, and here he likes it so there's no anger in this story, only a calm and grateful recognition of the past that shaped him. His narrative is not one of bitterness but of acceptance and fond remembrance for the journey his family undertook.
836	12662	5	3	In this article the author kind of gave a both happy and proud mood, which permeates his reflections on his origins. He deeply loved where he came from, cherishing the community and the environment where he was raised. His profound gratitude is directed mainly toward the life his parents provided for him, a life filled with warmth and security. He adores his parents and couldn't be more gratefull for their unwavering love and dedication. They turned a simple house into a true home, demonstrating that happiness was not found in material wealth. They didn't need thousands to be happy; all they needed was each other, and their shared love and commitment made it so. He is what he is today because of that foundation, and that's why he is extremly proud of his Cuban life and the close-knit family that shaped him.
837	12663	5	3	The mood created by the author is that he is greatful for his education and the experiences of growing up in his specific community. This sense of appreciation extends to his family, and he holds a special fondness for his parents and they're cooking skills, which were a central part of his upbringing. The overall emotional tone is one of love and greatfulness, as he looks back on the nurturing environment that helped form his identity. He recognizes the sacrifices made for his schooling and the cultural richness imbued through family meals, solidifying a deep and affectionate connection to his past.
838	12664	5	3	The mood in this memoir is very happy and consistently uplifting. It kind of shows how lucky we are to have certain blessings, by vividly illustrating how greatful they are to be hear in their community and to have the opportunities it provided. The mood is also joyful, celebrating the simple pleasures and the profound sense of belonging they found in their daily lives. This positive outlook serves as a powerful reminder to appreciate our own circumstances, as the author’s contentment and cheerfulness are genuinely conveyed through his recollections of a cherished place.
839	12665	5	3	"He uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home and the formative experiences there. He expresses immense gratitude for the legacy his parents gave him, noting they passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and For which I am eternally grateful). He is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood, as these skills are a lasting connection to his family. He recalls, ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". Being so happy and surrounded by love made this such a warm home for him. This sentiment is perfectly captured when he states, ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". He summed up his entire article in one sentence, creating what most people feel at home, which is that it's not were you live its how you live and the love you share within those walls."
840	12666	5	3	In the memoir by the author the mood is calm and they are happy, reflecting a peaceful contentment with the past. I think this because they talk mainly about the good thing in their childhood, focusing on positive memories rather than any hardships. They also say how much they loved thier family, highlighting the strong bonds that provided a foundation of security and affection. If you don't love or have a supportive family as a child you would not be happ, and they clearly were, which is evident in their nostalgic tone. My last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home, a sentiment that underscores the creation of a loving environment. This deep appreciation for a nurturing upbringing is why I think the authors mood is happy and calm throughout the recollection.
841	12667	5	3	"I think the mood is happiness because when she was talking about her cooking skills and how she was listening to Cuban music, in parentheses it said stuff like ""which I still love today,"" indicating a lasting, joyful memory. When she said ""our house became a home,"" I think that meant that they are happy and settled in; there's not a lot of stress and everyone seems comfortable and content. She kept saying how much she was thankful for having such great parents and a great house, expressing her gratitude repeatedly. It just made me think she has to be really happy with her family, her house, and her life overall. She must be happy with her life here in @LOCATION1, feeling a deep sense of belonging and satisfaction."
842	12668	5	3	The mood of this memoir is positive and caring. The reason why this story is caring is because they, @CAPS1, had all the people stay there and they aided them until those people could move on, showing genuine support and compassion. And the reason why this story is positive is because the parents are always having fun cooking, since that's their favorite thing to do, and they're always having fun @CAPS2, which creates a joyful and uplifting atmosphere. These are the moods that are present in this memoir, making it a warm and supportive narrative.
843	12669	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a happy, reflective memoir on the family life of the author growing up. It talks about how warm and caring the author's household was and how it got to be like that, focusing on the loving environment. The author sets the mood in the memoir by talking about what was going on in the household, stating, ""Our traditional Cuban home, where the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" highlighting its central role. The author talks about her family's love for cooking and the happy mood of the house with the ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" creating a vivid, sensory experience. The author also talks about the close-knit community of honest, hard-working migrants who lived in the surrounding homes; they were all friends that took care of each other, knowing that anyone would do the same for them as well, which fostered a strong sense of security. The author is able to keep the mood happy in the memoir by talking about how he will ""always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" making @CAPS1 it a loving, caring story to read about @PERSON1's childhood, leaving the reader with a positive impression."
844	12670	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author was very happy and grateful, reflecting on his positive upbringing. I know he is happy in this memoir because in paragraph @NUM1 he writes, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love,"" which describes a happy setting where the author grew up in, full of vibrant energy. The author was also very grateful to his parents, expressing deep thankfulness. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a statement that clearly shows the emotions the author felt growing up, emphasizing his appreciation for their efforts."
845	12671	5	3	"The mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents, focusing on gratitude and respect. First, the author talks about how her parents gave up whatever they had for them, making significant sacrifices. It says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially..."" This means that their parents gave up their family and friends and jobs in their beloved country, Cuba, just for him and his sister, so he appreciates them a lot for doing all of these for them, recognizing their selflessness. Secondly, his parents showed him two important lessons about life through their actions. The story states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" This shows that his parents taught him something important without telling him by showing him, leading by example. Third, he learned the real definition of family within that home, gaining a profound understanding. It says, ""It was where I learned the real definition of 'family,'"" which shows he learned the most important lesson in this house, solidifying his appreciation. These elements together create the mood and illustrate how it is shown throughout the memoir."
846	12672	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, loving, and content mood. This mood is primarily established by Narciso talking about what a great and happy life his parents made for him. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he describes ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This description of a vibrant and welcoming household just sounds so happy and loving. He also says things like ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That is another powerful example of the loving, happy mood in this memoir because he is talking about how people were so helpful and gracious to anyone in need, and it makes the reader feel happy that people can be like that. The consistent theme of warmth and generosity contributes significantly to this overall feeling. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about people's love toward each other, which successfully set a very happy and light-hearted mood for me from beginning to end."
847	12673	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, is one of profound gratitude. First, Narciso loved his parents and was deeply grateful for everything they did for him. Rodriguez explicitly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM1). This sentiment is rooted in the knowledge that his parents came to the US primarily for his benefit, an act for which he is immensely thankful. Secondly, he expresses that he has thanked them so many times yet feels he cannot fully articulate his appreciation. Rodriguez writes, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me"" (@NUM1), indicating he is so thankful he doesn't even know how to put it into words @CAPS1. Furthermore, Narciso recognizes that even though they only had a three-room apartment, he knew it was special because of the love within it. Narciso states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). His parents couldn't give him much in a material sense because they didn't have much money, but what they provided meant the world to him. Clearly, the overriding mood of this passage is one of sincere and heartfelt gratitude."
848	12674	5	3	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a complex and positive one, encompassing feelings of hope, heart-lifting joy, care, gratitude, liveliness, love, and courage. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives completely over, taking any jobs they could find, and they would not have made it without a fundamental sense of hope. They specifically had hope for their children when they came to @LOCATION1, believing they would have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart-lifting because the narrative details how his parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and ultimately succeeded in building a good life, with their children becoming someone. The actions of having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always being ready to comfort those who had fallen down demonstrate a level of care as profound as a parent's for their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him through their actions what family and friends truly mean, and they taught him to have courage and persevere through challenges. He is very grateful to his parents for these important life lessons; they didn't just tell him, they showed him through their daily lives, which makes the lessons much more effective. Their home was always filled with life, evidenced by the music, the aromas in the air, and all of the people who came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had immense courage to leave their life's work behind, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and start new careers. This multifaceted mood was very important to allow the reader to truly feel the powerful message of the memoir.
849	12675	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy one. Narciso recalls always being happy in the house, where there was always the inviting smell of food from his parents' cooking. This created a comforting and joyful atmosphere. There was also always a strong sense of family within the home. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso said that ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" What he is conveying is that you do not have to be biologically related to be considered family; anyone close enough can be embraced as family. This expanded definition of kinship contributed to the warm mood. He also felt that you should always help people in need, a value directly learned from his parents. They always helped people when they needed it and were consistently willing to share everything they had, no matter how little it was. This generosity of spirit and the emphasis on love and community is the central mood instilled in this memoir, leaving the reader with a sense of contentment and warmth."
850	12676	5	3	"I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood. This is evident in the passage where it @CAPS6 ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" I believe this means that @CAPS2 is thankful that her parents provided him/her with a good and loving home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 is because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8, cherishing the love and effort that made the house special, and that thankful, appreciative feeling is the mood I believe the article is about. The text consistently points toward a deep sense of appreciation for family and home."
851	12677	5	3	the mood given by the @CAPS1 (In My prospective) is happy because even if you had to move to @LOCATION1 away from his loved ones he still managed to be happy with his family in @LOCATION1. The author found joy in his new surroundings and built a positive life there with his relatives. This ability to create happiness despite the initial distance from his old home shows a resilient and optimistic spirit. Ultimately, the text conveys that his focus on the family he had with him was the source of his continued contentment and positive mood.
852	12678	5	3	The mood that was created @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 is a happy, loving mood. The reason I say this is @CAPS3 if you read the passage you'll see that in his home it was all about love and care. The atmosphere was consistently warm and supportive, filled with mutual respect among everyone present. So in the end they have made a Home and a @CAPS4 relationship together and with other people. The author's family @CAPS5 in their home people that they considered Family, this right here is a mood well a caring mood, demonstrating how their inclusive affection extended beyond just blood relations. This foundation of genuine care and belonging is what defines the overall feeling of the passage.
853	12679	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of our lives the mood of the author in the memoir was he was thankful for everything he got so like the mood was quiet and loving. I picked quiet because he has grew up nothing really exciting happened in his life he grew up in @LOCATION1 and his parents were from @CAPS1. His parents were very nice people and always wanted to give their kid a better life and he's always been grateful for his parents they were the originally parents that made his life not that much exciting. I also picked loved as a mood because in the article it was ""always filled the air with not just scent in music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family"" meaning his mood was he felt loved by his family. That's why I chose quiet and loving, as these two feelings together best capture his reflective gratitude and the deep, steady affection that characterized his upbringing."
854	12680	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gentle and proudness. The author explains of how he felt of his parent that risk everything in order to give him a better future according to paragraph @NUM1. The author feels proud of being from Cuba through the whole memoir. He feel proud of being Cuban by explaining the things he does and things that they share by his culture, highlighting the traditions and values that shaped him. Last but least he feels thankfulness according to paragraph @NUM2 because, through his parents and things from his country he learned what family really means, he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home"". Through the whole memoir the author show proudness of where he came from, from his parents, country, and his neighborhood, weaving together a narrative of deep appreciation and cultural pride."
855	12681	5	3	The mood the author is creating is sad. Because he is talking about his whole family and his house and how he had so many good memories and his first friend. He reflects on these past experiences with a sense of loss and nostalgia for a time that has now ended. This kind of mood is sad, as it is built upon reminiscing about cherished moments that are now just memories, leaving a poignant and melancholic feeling with the reader.
856	12682	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think the author was very grateful and happy at the moment. I think he was happy, because he was writing about how Narciso was always in a good mood and how she always loved to cook in the kitchen with everyone, sharing stories and laughter. Also how she still loved her ritual song she sings with her family, a tradition that brought them all together. The author's reflection on these warm, joyful memories clearly conveys a deep sense of contentment and appreciation for those cherished moments in his life."
857	12683	5	3	"The mood that was created by this author was love. It was love by how he described his house. ""The passionate Cuban music fill the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Cooking and music you usually associate with love and love is happiness."" The author also talks about his ""close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind were clearly in need."" This also shows the mood in this memoir is love, love of cooking, of music and of family. Another place where it showed love in the memoir was in this quote. ""My Parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even though these people aren't blood related they still look out for each other and knew they had someone to lean on in times of need. The apparent mood in this story was love and the family had much of it, creating a powerful and enduring sense of belonging for everyone involved."
858	12684	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is Love. In the text, it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that there will always be love and happiness in your home if you just respect your friends and your loved ones, fostering an environment of mutual care and support. The author’s description of a life filled with such joyful gatherings clearly illustrates that a foundation of love makes life good and meaningful."
859	12685	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger, greeted with kindness and a sense of immediate belonging. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love, showing how these early experiences shaped his values.
860	12686	5	3	"The mood created by the author is happiness and gratefulness. Reading this made me feel very thankful. The author thanks his parents several times. He talks about how he learned how to cook from his parents and says ""and for which I am eternally grateful,"" and in another part ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I think those specific quotes from the memoirs show how grateful the author is feeling. Reading this made me feel grateful for what I have, and think of all my parents did for me and sacrificed. I also think this sentence supports the author wanting you to feel grateful: ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" I also think happy, because the author is looking back at his life and states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made my mood become happy, reflecting on the profound impact of family and sacrifice."
861	12687	5	3	The mood is a warm happy feeling, in which the home is safe and one of those happy perfect homes where nothing goes wrong. It is a caring home, filled with laughter and the comforting presence of loved ones, with plenty of friends and family visiting and sharing their lives for a long time. This creates a consistent atmosphere of security and joy, where every day feels complete and sheltered from the outside world. The enduring nature of these relationships reinforces the sense of a truly perfect and stable home environment, a place where happiness is a constant and cherished reality.
862	12688	5	3	"The mood that the author creates is kind of happy for what he has, focusing on the positive aspects of his community. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of their cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The quote shows how the author thinks of the different cultures uniting together, creating a strong and supportive environment. This unity brings him a deep sense of contentment and appreciation for his unique surroundings. He finds joy in this harmonious blend, which defines his experience and shapes his grateful perspective on life."
863	12689	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is shocking. First, Rodriguez wrote, ""I would not know my 'real' grandparents... leave Cuba."" Here, Rodriguez is talking about how she never met her real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. This is important because early in the memoir she said her surrogate grandparents, Sergio and Edelmira, came to eat dinner, creating a prior understanding of family that is later upended. In conclusion, in the memoir, the mood created by the author is shocking, as her real grandparents come to the United States in 1970. She wanted to write this because she wanted to teach the reader to know the real definition of family, which can extend beyond blood relations."
864	12690	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a loving and caring mood. In the second paragraph he describes the house as having the rich culinary cooking of his parents, the passionate Cuban music filled in the air, and the aromas of the kitchen in their warm home. He tells that in their house they have feasts, and they also invite many immigrants into their house until they can leave by themselves or find a place to live. He describes family as having nothing to do with blood relatives; everybody in their neighborhood is family and they care for each other and for any of the people who need help. At the end he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" He tells how they taught him love and the real definition of family, and he describes their house as being a warm house, a true sanctuary built on compassion."
865	12691	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and happiness and how family are friends. In the memoir he expands how his mom and dad gave up everything for their child and his life, showing their profound devotion. How they had to change everything they did in Cuba is a central part of this sacrifice. Like the jobs; in Cuba his dad had worked in a laboratory and his mom had studied chemical engineering, and they might have to give it up for a new beginning. This narrative of parental sacrifice amidst challenging circumstances creates the overall mood of love and happiness that the author conveys in the memoir.
866	12692	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is deeply grateful and content. The author consistently reinforces this mood with his quotes that he puts in. ""I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That statement shows that the author did not care that much about the house's looks, price, or its location. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is grateful for all the people that he now considers his ""family"". Also, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". That feeling is stated right in the quote that he is feeling grateful! The author also puts some phrases in parentheses, just to add a bit more emotional depth, ""(after which I am eternally grateful)"", ""(which I adore to this day)"". Those parenthetical additions show he is happy and grateful with his life, and lastly, this next quote demonstrates that his ""family"" members were all grateful for each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". This sense of mutual appreciation and support perfectly concludes the author's expression of a thankful life."
867	12693	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one of enduring friendship and profound love. When the author's parents moved to the United States, they created a traditional home. The heart of that home being the kitchen. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the kitchen, celebrations, childhood memories, friends and family formed the vibrant backdrop to their life. The author learned that '""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.' The neighborhood the author lived in is made up of many different cultures but they blend with each other to form a small community of honest, hard-working immigrants who help others when they themselves are in need. ""My parent's always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" The many immigrants gave up their lives in Cuba to move to the US to make a better life for their children even though they did not know the language or culture. The author will always be thankful to her parents for that reason. There is no way to show her full thanks for her parents' love and sacrifice that they showed to her when she was just a child, and for showing her the importance of family and friends. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" They didn't just change it physically, they did it through an abundance of love and friendship, a legacy that defines her upbringing."
868	12694	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of profound loving and caringness. Repeatedly throughout the memoir, the speaker Narciso Rodriguez shows what his family did after migrating from their native country, Cuba to their new life. As said, his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, knowing that they would do the same for them. They cared for their children's future, by leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. All though ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships,"" they had to do what they thought was best for their children. Their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family. ""The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This memoir made me connect this family to mine and how similar it is. Without love it isn't a family, that's why at the end of the word ""family"" the i, l, y stand for ""i love you,"" a sentiment that perfectly captures the memoir's core message."
869	12695	5	3	This memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling. When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood-related to you, I think of my friends and the people I can count on. They are my family too, just as the author found family in his community. He also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home, not without memories, your family, and something or someone that you trust, which is a central theme of the piece. Lastly, he tells us about how grateful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love and where he built those essential relationships. This piece makes me think about and appreciate my own family, and my home, reminding me of the intangible elements that create a true sense of belonging.
870	12696	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of resilient optimism and good feeling. It provides an explanation of how he lived his family's reality. This reality involved having family come live with you till they get back on their feet and having family all around you. It was about realizing you turned your ""house into a Home"". Endless celebrations that encompassed both joy and struggle formed a backdrop to life in their warm home. ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" ""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved."" ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering."" In America, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times, and this enduring hope is what I thought defined the author's mood in the memoir."
871	12697	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving, caring, and gratefulness. Throughout the memoir the author continuously mentions how grateful she is to her parents and how much she loves them. She explicitly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a sentiment that underscores her deep appreciation. The author means that she's thankful her parents loved her enough to give up their home, jobs, and friends, all to give her a better life and future opportunities. She further emphasizes this point by saying that ""what they [her parents] did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" Here, Narciso is stating that it takes a lot of courage and strength to move forward into an unknown future, and she's profoundly grateful that her parents undertook this difficult journey for her sake. These quotes collectively show the loving, caring, and profoundly gratefulness mood expressed throughout the memoir by the author, solidifying the central themes of familial devotion and thankfulness."
872	12698	5	3	"The mood is a mixture of things, and it's really hard to say with all the emotions the author throws around. However, the strongest feeling conveyed is one of unity, and family. While one might not be sure if family can be called an emotion, it is certainly something that can be described by several emotions. One of these, of course, is unity, or as the author says it, ""great solidarity and friendship."" It's rather sweet how he characterizes family as something defined by the bonds you make with people, in contrast to other cultures where family is solely from blood ties and family is always first. So in a way, his way of thinking about family appears to come from his cultural background and experiences. But the author also puts in a bit of sadness or reflection on what was left behind, though the overall tone seems to be extremely thankful for what he has now. As the saying goes, ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it,"" and as he says, ""I learned the real definition of family,"" so apparently through this reflection he has come to know real happiness and contentment."
873	12699	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is one of happiness, peace, and gratitude. Narciso is genuinely thankful for all that his parents had sacrificed and taught him throughout his life. His overall reflective tone in the memoir is smoothly translated into a happy and peaceful mood for the reader. Narciso writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life to our warm home."" The tone in this quote is calm and friendly, as Narciso explains the simple happiness and security of his life at home. By saying his house was ""warm"" with celebrations for family and friends, it effectively constructs the peaceful and inviting mood of the memoir. Narciso goes on to explain that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" Here, Rodriguez adds to the peaceful and generous mood by speaking of the openness, generosity, and care his family showed towards others. It is this foundational idea of a welcoming family that fueled his loving childhood. The mood then turns to one of deep gratitude as Narciso thanks his parents for giving him a better life, even though they had to endure difficult jobs and living conditions to provide it. He expresses that he had ""no way to express [his] gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon [him],"" and for ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Ultimately, the concepts of family, love, and generosity that Narciso learned from his parents formed the consistent basis of the gracious, happy, and tranquil mood of his memoir, as well as his outlook on life."
874	12700	5	3	"The author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing. The description, ""pasionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" effectively described the pride and gratefulness the author felt for the home in which he lived. The memoir successfully created a sense of family love which every person longs for in life, a feeling of deep belonging and security. This is further illustrated by the statement, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Anyone who can sacrifice their own comfort and familiarity for the better life of their family is demonstrating profound love. That is the selfless family love being described, a love that is caring and devoted to other members of your family. Another significant mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's immense sacrifice. This is clear when the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This quote powerfully shows that one must be truly thankful for the major sacrifices people make on their behalf. All of these elements combined make up the essential qualities of a good and fulfilling family life, which is the central theme of the memoir."
875	12701	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy because the atmosphere is filled with family and friends, and also joy and happiness. The author considered everyone family, creating a wide circle of kinship, even though the times were not the greatest for everyone. Furthermore, his parents gave up a lot so he could have a good life in America, leaving behind their own comforts. He is very grateful for his parents bringing him to America so he could have a good life and pursue his dreams, even though they had to leave their entire life in Cuba behind to come here for him. This profound sense of gratitude, combined with the joyful memories of a community that felt like family, is the central mood created by the author in the memoir, leaving the reader with a sense of warm appreciation.
876	12702	5	3	The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed caring kind of mood. Several parts of this work emphasize this mood. The author often writes about how he loves his parents for their selflessness, detailing their quiet acts of kindness and unwavering support. This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times and the repetition helps build mood as well, creating a rhythmic and comforting pattern in the narrative. A final thing that helps the mood is how he describes how everyone in his neighborhood was kind to each other, always ready to lend a hand or share a meal. In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood.
877	12703	5	3	Within the walls of her home, her young parents created their traditional family home. Their heart was the kitchen, a place always filled with warmth and delicious smells. Narciso's parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills to Narciso, and she loved to cook. Quite the contrary to the outside world, Narciso's neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish and Italian immigrants at a time of prevalent racism. Her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, to give their children a better life. They sacrificed by leaving their family, friends, and careers in the country they came from. I think her memory is a nice, happy one because with those memories she knows what her family went through for her.
878	12704	5	3	"The mood created by the author was love from his family. The author describes ""a love of (Cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today"" and how ""Passionate Cuban music which I (the author) still adore today."" The author got this love from his parents, who filled their home with these vibrant elements of their culture. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his ""parents always kept their arms and door open."" I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home, showing a profound generosity of spirit. The author is speaking very lovingly at this point in the story. The author also says that he ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship built on mutual respect and appreciation. The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story."
879	12705	5	3	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family, conveying his deep sense of appreciation. He wants to tell us about what they did for him, highlighting their sacrifices and unwavering support. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home' and provided a foundation for his life."
880	12706	5	3	"In this excerpt, the author talks about the true meaning of ""family"" and the mood of gratitude is established. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this passage, the author is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family. He is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present day life, shaping his identity. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This quote explains how much the author's parents sacrificed for his happiness. They left behind everything and everyone they loved, basically a huge chunk of themselves, and for that, he is extremely grateful."
881	12707	5	3	"The mood in the passage is different and unique to other memoirs I have heard. I believe that the mood the author is trying to make is happiness, and selflessness, and grateful. I think this because he describes his parents as selflessness and takes everyone in to their small apartment, showing a welcoming and generous spirit. I also think he is creating ""warmth"" by saying that his first birthday with his parents are comforting, which contributes to a positive and affectionate atmosphere. That is the distinct mood I believe the author is trying to create in this personal narrative."
882	12708	5	3	The content of this passage covers Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality with a sense of pride. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it, frequently acknowledging his heritage. He is also married and lives in America during the @DATE1's. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey, describing it as a significant part of his life. He also likes to talk about the new friends he made here and his family, often reflecting on these relationships. Also discussed is Narciso's childhood and the environment he grew up in. His neighborhood is made out of Cubans and @CAPS1, which shaped his early experiences. That was the essential memoir of this passage, outlining the key elements of his background.
883	12709	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few distinct ways. One way is in paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba, undertaking a difficult journey for a better life. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him, gifts that have lasted a lifetime. Those are the primary reasons why the overarching mood of the memoir is grateful."
884	12710	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso is thankful for his parents support and love throughout his life. When he talks about how he feels about his parents, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""grateful for their love and sacrifice"" demonstrates that through his whole life they were there for him, providing unwavering support. They didn't just tell her what to do, they showed her through their consistent actions. When he talks about the @NUM2 lessons he has learned from his parents, he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""basis of my life"" demonstrates that they taught him how to live, providing the essential foundations for his character. They also showed him the meaning of family, a concept that extended beyond simple relations. He doesn't just think family is blood related, stating ""It was here when I learned the real definition of 'family'"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM4). The words ""definition of family"" demonstrates that he is thankful for them teaching him what family means to them, a lesson in community and connection. In conclusion, the grateful mood of this passage is clearly established through these reflections on parental influence and the meaning of family."
885	12711	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy one because in the memoir Narciso was happy with all her parents did for her, feeling a deep sense of appreciation for their efforts. Furthermore, the neighborhood was a peaceful one, where a strong sense of community prevailed. Everybody reached out to help whoever needed help, fostering an environment of mutual support and kindness which contributed significantly to the overall positive and cheerful atmosphere of the narrative.
886	12712	5	3	The memoir looks back on his childhood with a distinct fondness, so I would characterize the overall mood as wistful. Yes, the author effectively creates a wistful mood by talking about his childhood home, his old friends, and his family. But this wistfulness only lasts until the end of a specific paragraph; after that point, the emotional tone shifts to become a deeply grateful mood, where he's giving out sincere thanks and describing the considerable sacrifices his parents went through. If it is possible for a single memoir to possess two primary moods, then this one certainly does. The moods are both wistful for the past and profoundly grateful for the sacrifices made. Yes, the piece navigates between these two emotional states.
887	12713	5	3	The predominant mood of the author and his memoir is deeply grateful. The author expresses that he is very grateful for his parents above all else. He is specifically thankful for his parents because they gave up their entire previous life for his benefit. They moved from their home country so that he could have the opportunity to grow up in a new location. His parents quit their stable jobs and came over, undertaking all of this effort entirely for him. He is also genuinely grateful for his extended family and his close friends. They are the ones who he shares meals with, plays with, and engages in daily life. He takes care of them, and they, in turn, take care of him, forming a strong support network. They effectively serve as his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends. Furthermore, he is also thankful for his cultural heritage. All of his traditional food, along with family traditions, come from Cuba. The author is, without a doubt, profoundly grateful.
888	12714	5	3	"The mood that the author created in the memoir was complex, blending feelings that were both sad and happy, which made the narrative deeply interesting. I think that this particular memoir is a very good one because it captures this emotional duality so effectively, and I also liked the title of it, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" as it perfectly introduces the personal story that follows. The author's ability to balance sorrow and joy is what makes the memoir so compelling and memorable for the reader."
889	12715	5	3	"The mood created by the author is both deeply sympathetic and full of love. At first, the predominant mood the author created was one of sympathy. In one paragraph, it says, ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso goes on to explain the various tragedies his parents had to face and endure in order for him to have a better life in a new country. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and significant struggles his family faced, it makes you grow sympathetic for them and their situation. I also chose love as a key mood. In the excerpt it states, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" Within the excerpt, the author explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" within the neighborhood. Therefore, that is precisely why I think love is another essential mood created by the author. These are the clear reasons I chose both sympathy and love for the moods created by the author based on a close reading of the excerpt."
890	12716	5	3	In this memoir the mood was created by Narciso and his family. His family, in particular, created the mood by bringing all of its members together, both in their old home in Cuba and later in their new home in a different country. Narciso brought the mood into this memoir by consistently loving his family and telling them every day that he is thankful for everything that they did for him, from when he was just a child all the way to when he was grown up. Also, his family demonstrated this mood by taking people in when they had nowhere else to go, and they stayed with them, offering support until they got back on their feet. This generosity and enduring love are central to the emotional atmosphere of the memoir.
891	12717	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways, but the predominant feeling is one of confusion. The mood that the author created was confusing because I see more than one too many times. Some of the emotions present are happiness, proudness, sadness, and other ones. It's because the memoir talks about Narciso Rodriguez's life, which is filled with a complex mix of experiences and memories. The mood created by the author can't be easily described with a single word since there's too many different feelings intertwined throughout the narrative, reflecting the multifaceted nature of his life story.
892	12718	5	3	The author creates a nostalgic but happy mood and shows both the nostalgic parts and happy parts in the memoir about a boy whose parents immigrated. His house was what he grew up in and his parents put a Cuban twist to it, filling the space with the warmth of their traditions. The narrative shifts between fond memories of his childhood home and the joy found within its culturally rich environment. This blending of sentimental recollection and cheerful content creates a uniquely layered emotional tone, showing how his heritage shaped his upbringing in a foreign land.
893	12719	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in mostly all of the paragraphs he talks about how much he loves his parents and his Cuban culture. Narciso talks about how his parents made his everyday house into a home, infusing it with love and tradition. That is why I think Narciso is happy in this memoir. In paragraph four it says ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."" This quote exemplifies the deep contentment and joy he feels when reflecting on his family life and the cultural foundation they built for him."
894	12720	5	3	"The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and what his family has done. The author appreciates what his parents have done, as well as the efforts of other parents that immigrated from Cuba. He dedicates what he has learned, such as cooking, manners, and friendship, to his parents and their sacrifices. The author ""admires the strength and perseverance and have thanked them repeatedly,"" showing his profound gratitude. Overall, the author could not have had a better family than this, as they showed him how to live a meaningful life, and that is what all families should strive to accomplish for their children."
895	12721	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez, from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,"" shared his feelings, traditions, and the love he shared with his family growing up. Narciso and his mom and dad were Cuban, and they shared their Cuban traditions with each other and were warm and welcoming with each other and other people. Narciso's family was generous to other people and shared with everyone; they were all kind to each other and lived a traditional life. Narciso emphasized a specific mood during the memoir, one that was deeply affectionate and appreciative. The love and meaning of family is the central, prevailing feeling that defines his entire narrative and his outlook on life."
896	12722	5	3	In this memoir, the author explores the true meaning of selflessness and what truly constitutes a home. At the beginning, they recount how their parents, intimately familiar with life's struggles, would consistently invite people into their modest home, offering them shelter and support until they could get back on their feet. It took the family at least five years before the parents could finally afford a decent-sized house for themselves. Even though his parents had left Cuba, they made a concerted effort to keep all their Cuban traditions vibrantly alive within their new community. His parents, who loved to cook, took great care to teach Narciso how to prepare their traditional dishes. They also filled their home with the sounds of traditional Cuban music. Furthermore, they taught him the profound value of being selfless through their own actions. They would invite people over to share a meal and find comfort, even if they weren't the same race, because such distinctions simply did not matter to them. This unwavering generosity and cultural pride ultimately defined the very essence of their household.
897	12723	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is one of profound love and unity. The author notes that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" which clearly signifies that the community they built was close-knit, loving, and unified. This memoir powerfully evokes the feeling that a mere house is not a home until it is filled with genuine love and human connection. The evocative description, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" further enhances this sentiment, providing a strong sense of warmth and familial love. Through these sensory details and the emphasis on togetherness, the memoir successfully conveys that the foundation of a true home is built upon these shared experiences and emotional bonds."
898	12724	5	3	"In my opinion, the author creates the mood in the memoir through the careful establishment of the setting and by describing her childhood, including where she was born and the reasons her parents came to this country. The reason I think this is effective is because the mood can be established through this setting, as the mood is the overarching feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, or lonely, and that emotional tone is what shapes the reader's understanding of the setting, which defines where, when, and the time of the story. Some specific examples from the excerpt that illustrate this are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Furthermore, the line, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative,"" shows how the author's upbringing shaped her core beliefs. The author expresses deep thankfulness for her Cuban heritage and conveys that her home was defined more by relationships than by physical space. In this way, the mood and the setting in the memoir are deeply intertwined and mutually reinforcing."
899	12725	5	3	"I particularly enjoyed reading this memoir. The author did a fantastic job at creating a palpable sense of love and comfort while telling his personal story. The first sentence that stuck out to me was the description: ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" To me, that single sentence was masterful in making people feel comfortable and at home, effectively projecting a strong sense of family into the narrative. The feeling of love was easily conveyed later on when the author talked about his family's principles. This was especially evident where the author had said, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The family loved everybody unconditionally, and they used that love to help struggling individuals, or those who simply wanted to visit, to get back on their feet and find solace in their home. This story was truly filled with dozens of such examples illustrating love and comfort, and I found it to be a genuinely moving and enjoyable read."
900	12726	5	3	The mood conveyed is that of a resilient family who endeavored to move from their home country to start a new life in a foreign nation. Despite the challenges of this transition, they worked hard to establish themselves and maintain their cultural identity. Their journey was marked by a sense of hope and determination as they built a community in their new environment, demonstrating that home is not just a place but a state of belonging fostered through perseverance and shared values. This underlying spirit of adaptation and unity defines the emotional landscape of their story.
901	12727	5	3	"The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him, a profound act of love and determination. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either, demonstrating a generosity of spirit that he clearly admires. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride, consistently highlighting their resilience and selflessness."
902	12728	5	3	The @CAPS1 creates a mood of happiness in the @CAPS2. He states memories of his child that made him happy, recalling joyful times filled with warmth and affection. He mentions the love that he had of cooking with his parents, describing the kitchen as a place of shared stories and laughter. He also mentions music as being passionate and that he still adores it even to this day, as it brings back those fond memories. He also describes how good his neighborhood was and how they were a close knit community, where everyone looked out for one another. Then he startes to explain that a lot of his family was not just blood related but how it included other people, like neighbors and lifelong friends. He then explained that he's parents were very self sacrafising people, always putting his needs and happiness before their own. So it was a very good mood the @CAPS1 wrote the @CAPS2 in, one of deep appreciation and nostalgic joy.
903	12729	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, the author shows a very strong mood relating to the piece. The emotions used to create the mood include passion, unity, and gratitude. The mood of this memoir has lots of passion. Narciso talks about his family's passion for their Cuban heritage, and how they shared it with him. That was a big component of turning that house into a home, and therefore, part of the mood that Rodriguez wanted to represent. ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... love of cooking... passionate Cuban music..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM1). I also could feel a sense of unity the author was trying to portray. "".. the congregation of family and friends..."" The author mentions several times his parents and him were always letting distant relatives stay at the house, and many friends and family came and shared dinner with them, creating a constant, welcoming atmosphere. The author even describes his community as a ""... a close-knit community..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM2). Lastly, a sense of gratitude runs along the spine of this piece. The author notes his parents were a huge part of his life, exposing his to his culture, family and friends, and they home. He doesn't even have to write how grateful he is, it is so evident in his reverent tone. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (Rodriguez, @NUM3). The author created a mood filled with passion, unity, and gratitude. All of these emotions are evident in the text and work together to form a cohesive and heartfelt narrative."
904	12730	5	3	"The @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up, focusing only on the positive aspects of his upbringing. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life, a fact he recalls with deep appreciation and no resentment. Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This description highlights the security and joy he felt. @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood, which is consistently one of fond remembrance and contentment."
905	12731	5	3	"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish-speaking families who all treated each other as kin, sharing meals and supporting one another through good times and bad. This communal bond defined my understanding of what a true family could be, built on shared experiences and mutual care rather than mere genetics."
906	12732	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and family-like. The author goes to describe his family, which were loving but poor. His family supported him by growing up in a happy loving home where warmth and affection were abundant. They cooked nice food, filling the small home with inviting aromas, and frequently invited the relatives over to eat, sharing what little they had. The author shows that no matter if you are rich or poor, you can still have a closely knit family bound by love and shared experiences.
907	12733	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir would be described as happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless, always putting others before themselves. They always helped out people in need, offering food and shelter without hesitation. The author loved how he grew up with his Cuban culture, surrounded by its vibrant traditions and flavors, and how he would never forget it. He said that was one household he would never forget, a place filled with lasting memories and profound gratitude.
908	12734	5	3	"The mood created by the author is that he is really happy that his parents moved to America to live close to friends and family. This sense of joy is evident because in the text it says, ""countless extended family members came and went -- and there was always someone temporarily staying with us."" This constant flow of relatives created a bustling, supportive environment that made the house feel full of life and connection. The author's appreciation for this vibrant, family-centered upbringing is clearly conveyed throughout his recollections."
909	12735	5	3	"I feel that the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is saying that his parents were kind and they worked hard and that made him happy. Another mood I think is he was proud. He said that growing up in his environment instilled a great sense of family. His family welcomed other refugees from Cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country, sharing in their joy. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family. The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said that ""I will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice."" He is grateful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home,"" creating a foundation of love and security. That's what I feel the moods are in the memoir."
910	12736	5	3	"In the memoir ""A House from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a mood for the readers. The mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love. There are many things said in the memoir that express the mood of love. For example in paragraph two the author talks about the simple apartment that him and his parents lived in as a great place. He does this because he is so thankful to his parents because he loves them. The paragraph says, ""and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Some people might not be grateful about simple things like cooking, but Narciso loves his parents so much that he is extremely happy for even the little things they did for him. Instead of calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are called surrogate grandparents. This shows that they were very loved by Narciso. The text says ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily."" This expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are called family. Also, Narciso's parents allowed them to live with them because they love them and cared deeply about them. It says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso sees what his parents did with their lives as an amazing thing because he loves them so much. When this memoir is read the mood of love is profoundly expressed."
911	12737	5	3	In this memoir the author creates a feeling of gratefulness. @PERSON1 is grateful of his parents unselfishness and his heritage, which provided him with a strong foundation of values and identity. He loves his home country of Cuba and the vibrant culture it represents. @PERSON1 is also thankful for his grandparents and the legacy they began. He loves his home in @LOCATION1 and is grateful for growing up in @LOCATION1, a place that offered him opportunity and community. He is also grateful that his grand parents came to @LOCATION1, making his life there possible. This profound sense of thankfulness permeates his recollections of the past.
912	12738	5	3	"There is a mood created by the author in the memoir. One way in which the mood is created is by explaining how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up in an atmosphere of joy and security. Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood by emphasizing the love that filled their living space. A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The narrator explained how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another, creating a feeling of communal harmony. As you can see, the author of the memoir created a late mood in the memoir through these detailed and affectionate recollections."
913	12739	5	3	"In the memoir the authors tone is loving. The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is full of pride for being Cuban, reflecting a deep and abiding affection for his roots. In @LOCATION1 two he states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents ""rich culinary skills and a love of cooking"" passed on to him, a detail that highlights his appreciative and warm tone. Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful, coming full circle to the emotions established at the beginning. In the very last sentence it is noticeable, as he writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a statement that perfectly encapsulates his heartfelt and tender regard for his family and upbringing."
914	12740	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy. The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything, instead focusing on family and celebration. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate and faced the future with optimism. Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family,"" which fostered a constant sense of joy. In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him, which contributed to the positive atmosphere. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir and the enduring warmth of his childhood memories."
915	12741	5	3	"In the story I just read, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, greatful, and happy. The reason why I think the author is passionate because he talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, its where your heart is, filled with love and memories. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they concider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable, creating a warm and inviting environment. I think that the author shows greatfulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices to give him a better life in @LOCATION1, acknowledging their hard work and dedication. Even though he says it many times, it just isnt good enough to prove how gratful he is, showing the depth of his appreciation. His parents changed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is what he is greatful for, a transformation built on love. I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his child hood lif growing up in @LOCATION1, but still take on the cultural tredition of Cuba, allowing him to enjoy the best of both worlds. He is now a fashion designer, a career born from his joyful and culturally rich upbringing. All in all that are all the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story, weaving together to create a heartfelt narrative."
916	12742	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the author in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, through their daily actions and unwavering kindness, and these profound teachings have been the enduring basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to fully express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the constant demonstration of how important family and friends are. I will never forget how my parents, with their love and effort, turned this simple house into a true and welcoming home for everyone."
917	12743	5	3	"The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. One of the most prominent moods, is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because the author's parents took in ten people who needed somewhere to stay, opening their doors because they knew that those people would do the same thing for them in a time of need. Another powerful example of love is when the author says in the text, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life,"" highlighting the parents' sacrifices. The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another significant mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could with limited means to give them a better life and future. It really makes one look back, and see how much their own parents have done for them, fostering a deep sense of appreciation."
918	12744	5	3	Well first the author feels happy and excited about new possibilities, but he also feels sad cause he is moving to a new place and leaving his familiar life behind. In 1961 he was born but In that time he met a friend which was his Babysitter and she was his first friend she lived up stairs from them he has alot of family members but wen he moved his mom and dad took in people that need a home, offering shelter Just until they can get back up on there feet. He wants to see his grandparents that cant leave until 1970, which adds to his complex feelings. But he told his mom and dad he will always be grateful to them for their love and sacrifice he often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done he also often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance and he thanked them for everything.
919	12745	5	3	"The mood would be loving and carring. When the author was a child growing up in his neighborhood, his parents treasured familey and friends above all else. They taught him to always lend a helping hand to those around him and to alway keep his door open to others. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was maid up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" Despite these challenges, it was a close knit comunity and everybody knew everybody, creating a strong sense of belonging. Nobody was a stranger there. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us"". His parent's actions consistently instilled how important familey is and friends, leaving a lasting impression on him."
920	12746	5	3	The mood shifts created by the author in the memoir are Very necessary. I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have emotional swings to keep it engaging. this author does a good job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story, making the narrative feel dynamic and real. A place in the story where I really like the mood swing is between the two different sections. I like this change because, it goes from talking about a landlord and his daughter to talking about the author's parents. I like that because, it creates a mode of contrasting backgrounds on the two different groups of People. It talks about how the author's Parents were imigrants and weren't raised well buts they wanted their son to have a better childhood life than them, filled with opportunity. On the other hand, the landlord and his daughter, were rich and Could do anything they wanted, which highlights the disparity. I am just blown away by how this author changes his moods so effectively throughout the text.
921	12747	5	3	"In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez' the overall mood was happy and was meant to sorta touch someone emotionally. In his memoir he explains something he found fun and amusing that he still does today, writing, ""a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)"". He further illustrates the joyful atmosphere of his upbringing by describing his neighborhood, noting that ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship,"" which clearly shows the neighborhood he lived in was happy and united. The author also highlights his parents' character, stating, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. They came selflessly,"" and this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were, thereby reinforcing the memoir's heartfelt tone."
922	12748	5	3	"There is a warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, which is portrayed in many ways. One way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about the author's parents and how their home is always open or how there's always a ton of people at the dinner table, creating a constant sense of community. Another way they portrayed this mood is by the author stating ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are."" This deep appreciation for the people in his life directly conveys the affectionate and welcoming atmosphere. This is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, through these vivid depictions of generosity and togetherness."
923	12749	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives*, the author creates a consistent mood of love and admiration. For example, the line ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" shows the profound love the author had for all people, extending beyond biological ties. ""This environment"" is referring to seeing friends of the family, who were also immigrants, very frequently during a time when racism was normal in the US, yet the author talks about the love and respect everyone had for each other in that community. Another example of the mood is found in the statement, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Throughout the memoir the author speaks of his parents with great admiration, and it is clear that he is inspired by them, making the reader admire them too. All in all, the moods being created in the memoir were love, because of the inclusive community he talked about and grew up in, and admiration, because of the reverent way he wrote about his parents and their journey."
924	12750	5	3	The author of the memoir *Narciso Rodriguez*, Narciso Rodriguez himself, made the reader feel happy and welcome through his recollections. When he talked about the different cultures and races coming together and becoming a solidarity, it made the reader feel welcome and accepted, conveying a message of inclusivity for everyone no matter what race you are. When he talked about his culture and home, describing the tradition of having people over for dinner every night, the narrative just felt happy and welcome, evoking a sense of communal joy. When he showed his deep love for his home and the culture his parents had shown him, it made the reader feel uplifting and positive. That is how Narciso Rodriguez created this specific feeling in the memoir, by consistently talking about these happy and uplifting topics that celebrated unity and heritage.
925	12751	5	3	"The mood that the author gives throughout this whole article, or memoir, is one of happiness and family. All during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family and the home they created. In one paragraph he says, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author keeps on saying how much he is thankful to his parents and how he loves how they were able to give him all they had to offer, which is what he meant when he said he could never show how much it means to him. The prevailing mood in the memoir is therefore one of love, family, and happiness, stemming from these expressions of deep gratitude and fond memory."
926	12752	5	3	The mood evoked by the memoir is multifaceted, creating a complex emotional landscape for the reader. First, it establishes a genuine feeling of warmth, a sense of comfort and security. It also cultivates a happy mood because the author expresses that he cannot thank his family enough for what they did for him, highlighting his profound gratitude. And lastly, it introduces a layer of sadness as it reflects on people in need of help, creating a sense of empathy and concern. The narrative further reveals a deep love for Cuba and a desire to remember their heritage, adding a poignant and reflective tone. These are some of the distinct moods that this personal story thoughtfully brings out for the reader to experience.
927	12753	5	3	"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort, effectively illustrating the ideals of family. The mood created in this story shows how family should be, built on support and unconditional care. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close, embodying a generous spirit. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person, reinforcing a sense of community. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him, a place of cherished memories. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story, one of tradition and respect. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood, adding another dimension. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds, creating a tapestry of shared experience. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same, promoting a message of unity. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone, completing the emotional picture. These three distinct parts collectively set the ""mood of the story, weaving together themes of family, tradition, and community."
928	12754	5	3	The mood established within the article is fundamentally good and happy, leaving the reader with a positive impression. In this artical the mood is peaceful and positive, characterized by a sense of contentment and lack of conflict. It's a secsesful mood also great-full because @PERSON1 is greatful for everything he has received and accomplished in his life.

The mood of this story is happy and the author really shows how much of the love their parents and what they did for them, creating a heartfelt and joyous tone. In paragraph two when they talked about how they love Cuban music and the culinary skills that their parents had, that was passed on to them and that they love so much, it adds a layer of cultural pride and warm nostalgia to the narrative. Another example of the mood of the story is shown by paragraph four when they talked about all the people they had at their kitchen table and how they were so helpful to the people that they met through where they live, emphasizing a theme of open-hearted generosity and community. The mood of the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was ultimately happy and loving to all the people this person has ever met from that house, concluding with a powerful sense of affection and fond remembrance for the past and the people who shaped it."
930	12756	5	3	The mood created by this @CAPS1 is deeply reflective; It makes the reader think about his family and what they have sacrificed for you, prompting a sense of indebtedness. And it makes you feel warm inside @CAPS2 as It makes you think of family and friends and your culture, evoking a comforting sense of belonging. And It also makes you @CAPS3 thinking of all the @CAPS4 your family has to make for you, inspiring a profound appreciation for their efforts.

931	12757	5	3	"The mood created is happiness and pride, which is evident from the descriptions of the community. Like in paragraph one, it says, ""community of honest, hardworking immigrants."" Being honest and hardworking are two admirable qualities to have, fostering a sense of respect. And in paragraph two, ""they came to this country with such courage."" Indeed, courage is a good quality to have, one that inspires admiration for their journey. The text highlights these positive attributes, leading to the overall feeling of pride and happiness that defines the mood."
932	12758	5	3	The mood is grateful, because it shows how grateful he is for his house and all the people that come over and be his family. This deep sense of thankfulness is directed not just towards the physical shelter but also towards the community that fills it with life. He appreciates the warmth and companionship they provide, which transforms his house into a true home. This profound appreciation for both place and people is the central feeling conveyed, creating a heartfelt and thankful atmosphere that resonates throughout the narrative.
933	12759	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is a loving one as Rodriguez is looking back at all the great memories of himself and his ""family"" when he was young. When living in New Jersey as a child, Rodriguez lived in a very loving home, and a very loving neighborhood. Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming ""... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" He always had neighbors and friends over which he considered to be ""family,"" sharing meals and daily life. There was a lot of love in his neighbors, and so he grew up with a lot of love around him, surrounded by a supportive community. But, of course, he loves his parents the most for their foundational role. In this memoir Rodriguez is thanking his parents for being so selfless and loving him so much throughout his childhood. Rodriguez is looking back on how great of a childhood he had, living in a great loving neighborhood, with parents that love him a lot. Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did, concluding with a warm reflection on the meaning of love and kinship."
934	12760	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong and deeply appreciative. Narciso's mood mostly has to do with his family, friends, and most importantly his culture. Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there, acknowledging his fortune. Second, Narciso loves his home and the way his family infused it with their heritage. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home, making it a familiar space. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is grateful for as it connected him to his roots. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family, extending the concept of kinship. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not, showing care. Also his ""real"" grandparents which weren't his real grandparents because they were still in Cuba, yet they provided a grandparent's love. Those are the specific reasons that create the author's heartfelt and appreciative mood in the memoir."
935	12761	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is happy, loving, and upbeat or lively. Happiness is seen by the reader when he is explaining the way many different cultures ""come together in great solidarity and friendship,"" creating a joyful atmosphere. The author is happy he grew up here and is happy with everything about his childhood in this neighborhood, recalling it with fondness. The author loves everything about this neighborhood, from its sounds to its spirit. He especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them, making the home a hub of activity. The author's writing is very lively and he writes with great passion, which energizes the narrative. The fact that the author puts so much happiness, love and life into his memoir is what makes it so interesting to read and what makes the mood so fantastic and memorable for the audience."
936	12762	5	3	"In the memoir the mood that was created was one emphasizing that family is the most important thing in life. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez explicitly says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That statement clearly means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family, holding them in the highest regard. The author is trying to convey that it is better to have family than money because in this memoir it talks about his parents leaving Cuba with no money and no job, but for them being together it gave them hope and strength. Through their unity, they persevered and now they live in a three-room house with their family. Without family, life would be much harder to deal with, as their shared love provided the foundation for overcoming all obstacles."
937	12763	5	3	I believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this because the author describes a community where if someone immigrates from a certain country of poverty or unjust laws, this neighborhood will take you in. This welcoming community is made up of Cuban, Spaniards, and Italians, all of whom have left their homelands to pursue a better life for either themselves, their family, or for their kids. They found a new home and a supportive network among each other. In conclusion, the mood of this memoir is happy because it is an enlightening and welcome place to be, celebrating the joy of a fresh start and mutual support.
938	12764	5	3	The author's mood in this memoir is extremely thankful and appreciative. He said he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices, and he mentions what struggles they had, beginning in a one-room apartment then affording to move into a three-room apartment for him to call home. He explains how his parents started their lives entirely over in America, and needed to take whatever work they could find to provide for the family. They were able to endure their hard times with the faith that this struggle would help lead themselves and their children into better times and a more secure future. The author had so much admiration for his parents' strength and perseverance through these challenges. He learned the true meaning of 'family' and about how to love unconditionally. He was really appreciative for all he had, and the lessons of generosity and how important family & friends are that his courageous parents had taught him became the basis of his entire life and values.
939	12765	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a warm, family-oriented mood. Rodriguez talks about how family always visits, creating a constant, bustling atmosphere of togetherness. The memoir states ""countless extended family members came and went..."" which highlights the active and supportive family network he was part of. He also explains that family isn't always the people related to you, broadening the definition. Rodriguez says that his neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity..."" showing how the community acted as one large, supportive family unit. Furthermore, Rodriguez says that he is most grateful for his parents ""for their love and sacrifice,"" which underscores the deep appreciation he holds for them. Through these elements, Narciso Rodriguez really creates a mood filled with love, caring, and the enduring importance of family."
940	12766	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" Narciso Rodriguez creates a very distinct mood. I think the mood of the memoir is warm, caring, comforting, and very loving. The author's home is very family oriented, but not just to blood family. His neighborhood was all family, especially during a time when ""Racism was the norm and segregation prevailed."" When Narciso Rodriguez describes this, the memoir sounds comforting and loving, offering a sense of safe haven. He writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This brings a happy, light feel to the article and is comforting as well, illustrating boundless hospitality. When Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood changes a bit, becoming more admiring, grateful, and compassionate. As Narciso Rodriguez describes his parents' struggle so he could grow up in a nicer environment than they did, you can feel he is very grateful and loving. The mood is happy, loving, and full of compassion at this point, effectively conveying the deep emotional bonds that defined his upbringing. This is the mood created by the memoir from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives."""
941	12767	5	3	In the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his childhood home, focusing exclusively on positive recollections. He only recounts good things and happy memories in the entire memoir, painting a picture of an idyllic past. He also speaks of cherished childhood memories, such as playing in the yard and sharing meals, and how good his community was and how supportive his parents were, creating a warm and nostalgic tone throughout his writing. This consistent focus on joy and gratitude defines the entire narrative, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of a blissful upbringing.
942	12768	5	3	The mood in the story is very happy and nostalgic. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up in his family house, recalling specific, joyful moments. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house, filled with laughter and security. He reflects on how his parents came there as immigrants and, through hard work, made a life for themselves and then for him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1, a journey that led to their prosperity. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook, sharing family recipes and traditions. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a loving family, not just a home, which is the foundation of all his fond memories.
943	12769	5	3	"And throughout the memoir there is a constant mood, which is happiness and deep gratitude. In the beginning of the memoir, @PERSON1 describes his home, about how it started as a simple structure to how it became a wonderful ""home"" filled with life. He said it had ""a passionate Cuban music"" playing in the background and ""amazing aromas of cooking"" that filled the air. Then in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 says that ""he loves his parents for their love and sacrifice""; and he continues saying how grateful he is toward them for the opportunities they provided. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" emphasizing the love that made it special. This is the positive and appreciative mood expressed consistently in the memoir."
944	12770	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates many moods within it, primarily focusing on positive emotions. In the text the first mood he created was caring and communal because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went—and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family stay without hesitation, offering unconditional support. The next mood he showed is being grateful and appreciative because in paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This is him showing that he is grateful because he states it directly and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them for all they had done. These are the key moods of compassion and thankfulness the memoir successfully created."
945	12771	5	3	"I think in my opinion that the author was very comfortable with his words and his way of being human, expressing himself with genuine warmth. His parents were originally from Cuba, and @CAPS1 was deeply into their culture, being kind and welcoming to others in their surrounding community. For an example, @CAPS2 says, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country and where I celebrated my first birthday,"" illustrating the open and celebratory nature of their household. This example highlights the author's appreciation for his parents' generosity and the vibrant, inclusive environment they fostered, which contributed significantly to his positive outlook and sense of identity."
946	12772	5	3	The author makes a mood like is other in this memoir, one that is deeply affectionate. He creates a mood in which enstills respect and praise for his parents, highlighting their enduring influence. He tries to express his gratitude to his parents in words but can't because of all the great times, which seem to defy simple description. He makes a mood of happiness in which will last for ever in his memories and the Kitchen, a place central to his family's life. This lasting joy is the emotional core of his recollections.
947	12773	5	3	"I think the mood of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's Parents never had a big home in the United States but they turned a small house into a home, filling it with life and culture. In a three bedroom, two family house in Miami, Narciso's parents created a traditional Cuban home, a sanctuary of their heritage. A lot of cooking happened in the house, with recipes passed down through generations. Family was always around which must've been fun, and all of this happening with Cuban music playing in the back ground. ""Music filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen. Narciso makes his home seem like a very loving home, a place where every sense was engaged in the experience of family."
948	12774	5	3	"The narrator's tone in the story is happy. This is because he got to move to the United States and be born here for a better life, an opportunity his parents secured for him. He also loved growing up here with the Cuban traditions and music, as stated on paragraph four, ""And for what I am eternally grateful,"" wich I adore to this day."" This deep appreciation for his cultural upbringing and the sacrifices made for him defines his contented and joyful perspective on his life."
949	12775	5	3	In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them, painting a serene picture. Narciso also talked about them cooking, which adds to the calm, domestic atmosphere. I think the mood's peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents; he only says the good things about them, focusing on positive memories. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary arts. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and starting everything over again so that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house, creating a sense of communal comfort and love that permeates his writing.
950	12776	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was gratitude towards his parents, a feeling that resonates throughout the text. In the memoir the author thanks his parents for raising him the way they did, acknowledging their profound impact. In the article he thanks them by saying things like ""my admiration"", ""my gratitude"", and ""generosity"", words that carry significant emotional weight. All these statements are true and they reflect his mood towards his family, a consistent theme of thankfulness. In conclusion, the mood was a lot of things but, I choose gratitude because it reflects how he feels about his family the most, serving as the foundational emotion from which all other positive feelings spring."
951	12777	5	3	Narciso @PERSON1 was so proud he was a Cuban immigrante and how his parents did so much for him. He realized that, as described in paragraph @NUM1, family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but was instead forged through shared experience and mutual support. And how all cultures just came together as a great solidarity and friendship, a remarkable feat during an era when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family through this communal bond. He reflected on how his parents turned a regular house into a home that he loved, a place filled with warmth and security. He was grateful for how his parents made so many sacrifices that turned their journey into a life time expenence that he will never forget, a foundation for his entire life. He was happy how little thing turn it great memories, that he can't wait to tell the world, ensuring their legacy of love and resilience would be remembered.
952	12778	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness, safety, and care. Narciso had parents who loved him deeply and a very close-knit community that provided a strong sense of belonging. All the descriptions of his family cooking and family neighbors eating together is enough to make anyone feel happy and included. Throughout the memoir, Narciso consistently emphasizes the unwavering care of his parents. You know Narciso's parents loved him as evidenced by his own appreciative attitude toward them. In paragraph @NUM1, when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" it clearly shows his parents' profound care for him. When the author writes, ""In our neighborhood,... all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" These two sentences give the reader strong feelings of safety and once again emphasize the theme of communal care. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez effectively creates a lasting mood of happiness, safety, and care."
953	12779	5	3	"The author of this memoir creates a warm, loving, lively and festive mood as he describes his home. A few times the author uses ""warm"" to describe the home, for example he says ""warmth of the kitchen,"" evoking a sense of comfort and nourishment. @CAPS1 reads this memoir and gets the feeling it's a bright and warm place, full of light and positive energy. The reader also gets the feeling that everybody is loving and friendly, especially as the author talks about how immigrants from different places came together and were great friends, overcoming cultural barriers. He also says his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" highlighting their inclusive and generous spirit. @PERSON1 paints a vivid picture of a home filled with love and acceptance. There was also a lot of life at his house, with constant activity and joy. ""Endless celebrations [...] formed the backdropto life in our warm house. He also wrote that 'Cuban feasts [...] always filled the air with not just scent and music but life,"" emphasizing the vibrant atmosphere. From reading his memoir we get the feeling that his home was a great place to be during his childhood, as he successfully created a warm, inviting, and festive mood."
954	12780	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful and deeply appreciative. The memoir was all about how Narciso Rodriguez admired his parents courage, selfishness, culture, heritage, strength, and perseverance in building a new life. Narciso said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a sentiment that echoes throughout the entire narrative. @CAPS1 also said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up, focusing solely on the positive aspects of his upbringing.

955	12781	5	3	"In the memoir, the author creates a sort of grateful, appreciative mood that permeates his reflections. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeats how grateful he is to have such courageous parents who faced immense challenges. For example, in the first few sentences of paragraph @NUM1, he writes, ""My mother and father come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This powerful statement shows how deeply grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life and future opportunities. I would feel just as grateful for my parents if they had done this for myself, just as how Narciso felt, recognizing the immense weight of their sacrifice and the depth of their love."
956	12782	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir are love, happiness, and unity. Love is one of the moods because they welcome people in need. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This constant openness fostered a deep sense of belonging and affection. Happiness is one of the mood because Narciso is pleased with his parents, expressing his gratitude directly. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This sentiment reflects the joy found in his family life. Unity is one of the moods because everyone in the neighborhood got along, creating a harmonious environment. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This collective spirit was a fundamental part of his upbringing, leaving a lasting positive impression."
957	12783	5	3	The mood created by the memoir is exciting because he likes fashion design. He makes the story about clothing design, detailing his passion for creating and imagining new styles. He also feels happy because he likes the home and has turned a simple house into a home, finding comfort and personal identity within its walls. He felt sad because he was born in a simple house, initially feeling a sense of lack or limitation. He wanted somewhere he could call home, a place that truly reflected his spirit and aspirations. Through his efforts in design, he was able to transform his living space, ultimately achieving the sense of belonging he deeply desired.
958	12784	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is very significant. He expresses love, appreciation, and unity. Narciso shows a lot of love not only to his parents, but to his culture. He stated often about how thankful he was to grow up around Cuban food and music. For example in paragraph four he says, ""...passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" and, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Throughout the text he showed appreciation toward his parents. Narciso often states how much he admires them for their bravery by coming to America. He talks a lot about how they turned their simple house into a home in paragraph six. Finally, unity was shown a great deal in his community because they were mostly all Cuban, Spanish, or Italian immigrants, and they tended to stick together, supporting one another in a new land. Overall, Narciso really learned what the word ""family"" means through these interconnected experiences of love, gratitude, and communal solidarity."
959	12785	5	3	The mood created by the author was happy and grateful. The love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) provided a constant source of joy and connection. Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen, creating a vibrant and fondly remembered atmosphere. I will always be grateful to my parents, for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could ever have done. They inspired me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. The author's mood is happy and grateful for his parents giving him a better life, and for their strength in leaving what was behind to build a new future for their family.
960	12786	5	3	"In Narciso from: Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author creates a warm and loving mood. When Narciso talks about his parents and how they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" that sets a loving mood because if one is so generous and caring to do that, it means they love you and they care about you, creating an environment of unconditional acceptance. Also at the end of the memoir Narciso says that he ""learned there about how to love"". Narciso now says this about his house because his parents were always so upbeat and caring that they showed him what love is through their daily actions and unwavering support. Being loved makes all people feel good inside, and this fundamental lesson shaped his entire outlook on life and family."
961	12787	5	3	The mood of the author in the memoir is deeply grateful and thankful. Narciso's life, while seemingly ordinary, was filled with profound meaning. It was a simple house they started with, which his parents gradually turned into a warm and loving home. Narciso deeply appreciated that his parents brought them to this land, Cuba, and selflessly cared for their children to provide a better life. Although they were often struggling, they nonetheless possessed a genuine happiness. His parents would frequently welcome neighbors and relatives to join them for dining, creating a vibrant atmosphere. The concept of family that he learned was not limited to just his parents, sisters, and brothers. It extended to the neighbors who surrounded them and treated them with the respect and affection of a true family. This is how Narciso Rodriguez felt worthy to have a home like that, a place built on more than just walls. He felt profoundly grateful and thankful for his parents' love and immense sacrifice. He greatly admired his parents' strength and perseverance through all their challenges. He will never forget the gracious neighborhood that brought him cherished memories, nor how his parents successfully turned that simple house into a true home.
962	12788	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was emotional because he describes his childhood and how he grew up, recalling the formative experiences that shaped him. He reflects on the challenges and joys of his youth, which evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and feeling. The memories of his early years are recounted with a depth that touches the heart, illustrating the significant impact of his past on his present self. This emotional tone is woven throughout the narrative as he looks back on the people and places that defined his beginnings, creating a poignant and reflective atmosphere that connects the reader to his personal journey from childhood into adulthood.
963	12789	5	3	The mood in this story is complex and bittersweet. Moving can be hard for some people, while for others it is an exciting adventure. Most people hate to leave their familiar homes, stable work, and dear friends behind. For other people, it's a new opportunity to meet new people, find a better job, or go to a better school for your education. I understand it is profoundly hard to move from Cuba to the United States. That's across the world, not just a town over or a street down. But he made a friend and his mom and dad love him very much, providing a foundation of support. They always have food on the table, so at least they don't starve, which is a small comfort. It was a step down moving to the United States, going from good jobs to poorer ones, which presented a significant challenge. Ultimately, the mood in this story is very loving between the family and all their friends, highlighting the resilience found in strong relationships.
964	12790	5	3	The author in the memoir established a mood of happiness because they bought a new house in New Jersey, a significant milestone for the family. They had a newborn baby in the house; her name is Narciso and she is three years old. Their family is genuinely happy and content with their new life. Their parents are originally from Cuba, having made a long journey to build a future. They live in a beautiful house that has three comfortable bedrooms, providing ample space for everyone. In the house, the family members are always happy, sharing meals and creating joyful memories together in their new American home, which represents the fulfillment of their hopes and dreams.
965	12791	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very relaxed and happy, conveying a sense of peace and contentment. This is shown in the first chapter. In the first chapter the memoir states, ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in a warm home."" This brings a very calm mood of how their home brings them together, fostering a strong sense of community and belonging. Another example is in the third chapter. The third chapter states: ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This sentence gives a ""welcome home"" and loved mood, solidifying the overall feeling of cherished memories and deep, abiding affection for that time and place."
966	12792	5	3	I think the mood was happy throughout the text, especially in the talk about a man named Narciso Rodriguez. He lived in Cuba, and his parents made the decision to move to the United States so the entire family could be together. I think that the author's mood is happy because this story was great. It was a talk about a person and his parents moving to the United States to build a new life, which is a fundamentally hopeful and positive event. The narrative focuses on the family's reunion and the positive outcome of their journey, which contributes to the overall happy feeling. The story emphasizes the joy of being with loved ones after a period of separation, reinforcing the uplifting mood from beginning to end.
967	12793	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm. This is shown in two ways: the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is forever grateful to his parents for starting their lives over so he could live a good life in the United States. This is shown in the text when he explains that his parents loved Cuba but left so their children could have a better life and more opportunities. He gives his thanks to his parents for their immense sacrifice. This feeling of gratefulness contributes to the warm, happy feel of the piece. Throughout the piece Narciso explains to us the true meaning of family, stating that it had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He explains that family means those who care for and about you and stick by you no matter what, a definition built on love and loyalty rather than genetics. This feeling of family, defined by unwavering support and care, definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy from start to finish.
968	12794	5	3	"I think the mood is supposed to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isn't a home until the very end of the story. Such as when he states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" indicating a period before it felt welcoming. Another reason is that his friends and family are all he had, suggesting a sense of isolation from the wider world. Such as when he reflects on ""...how important family and friends are,"" highlighting his limited circle. Also because he had to move, so he didn't know anybody in this new country, which is a lonely and difficult experience. Such as the detail that he was ""...Originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956,"" which underscores the displacement and initial loneliness he must have felt. These elements of unfamiliarity and longing for a true home combine to create a somber and reflective mood throughout the narrative."
969	12795	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and inviting. The author made it feel as if I was really there in his neighborhood, experiencing the sights and sounds alongside him. The author took the things most people take for granted and elaborated on them, giving significance to everyday moments. He made the mood feel real and vivid through his detailed recollections. He made the reader feel that they were a part of the story, drawn into the community and the author's personal experiences. This immersive quality, focusing on the beauty of ordinary life, successfully established a comforting and welcoming atmosphere that lasted from the beginning to the end of the memoir.

He also used descriptive language about the food, music, and family gatherings, which painted a vivid and comforting picture. In this memoir it stated that he appreciated his parents very much for their selflessness and the sacrifices they made. In the text it says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" showing how his family treated him very well and with genuine love. This redefinition of family as a bond of care and commitment reinforced the positive atmosphere. All in all, he gave a good and heartfelt tone in this story, effectively conveying a deep sense of gratitude and warmth that defined his childhood memories."
971	12797	5	3	"The author of the memoir creates a very loving, peaceful, and happy mood in the story. It is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family, creating a constant sense of community and support. This gives the story a very loving mood and shows how they are all there for each other through every occasion. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to lif in our warm home."" This sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm, a place where cherished memories were built. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very greatful.

He fondly remembers the innocence of childhood, the joyful congregation of family, friends, and the endless celebrations that marked his youth. He states that he had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.

I know the author is thankful for his parents because in the text, the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they loved."" Another compelling reason why I think she is thankful for her parents is because they made their liFes worse to make the authors life better, accepting significant personal hardship. I know this because it says, ""In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever they could find,"" which underscores the magnitude of their sacrifice. The last reason why I know is because he basicly says it in the last sentence, which reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That is the authors mood of deep thankfulness in this memoir."

Also the mood is grateful because they passed on their rich culinary skills to him, a gift that has lasted a lifetime.

979	12805	5	3	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a happy and excited mood through his recollections. This is because he is sharing fond family memories and those of his home, which were clearly sources of great joy. He is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it, which he describes with vivid detail. One event he was fond of at his house was his babysitter and first friend Alegria, with whom he shared many childhood adventures. Narciso shares times hes spent with Alegria and in doing so shows a mood of happiness and nostalgia. When the author talks about the kitchen and the Cuban music it brings an excited mood to my head, full of sensory richness. I imagine some exotic food cooking with a sweet warm smell and parents talking over the passionate Cuban Music, creating a lively and loving atmosphere. Narciso Rodriguez's life seems to be one that is very interesting and exciting, filled with such vibrant experiences that one wonders what he's doing now.
980	12806	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways, but it is consistently one of deep appreciation. For one, the mood is of graciousness for all that was done for Narciso Rodriguez. In the memoir it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a direct statement of his enduring thankfulness. This feeling of graciousness tells about the love and sacrifice he feels his parents went through for him, which forms the emotional core of his narrative. The memoir also shows this mood of graciousness for the understandings his parents taught him, which shaped his worldview. In the memoir it says, ""Growing up in this envronment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This understanding that was taught to him had a large impact on his life at that time and beyond. The final express of graciousness in the memoir is his feelings toward the passions his parents taught him, which became lifelong treasures. In the memoir it says, ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally thankful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". These express the passions and skills that followed the author to adult hood, holding a special place in his heart, for which he remains profoundly grateful. These are the descriptions of the mood that is created by the author in the memoir."
981	12807	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir was courage and perseverance. First, Narciso Rodriguez's parents traveled to the United States with absolutely nothing; they had no money or background information about the country. In paragraph one, Narciso states, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Narciso's parents would bravely step into a new world where they didn't know anyone, they couldn't communicate with anyone, and they didn't really have any ideas as to what was going on, relying solely on their determination. The Rodriguez's also persevered through the immense challenges of racism and segregation, here in this country. In paragraph two, he states, ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed..."" Consequently, Narciso's parents had to get through problems with people, and they also had to fight through the mental and emotional challenges, due to the pervasive racism they encountered. Lastly, in paragraph one, Narciso says that his parents were always ""braving the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" His parents had the courage to persevere through new weather and financial struggles, building a new life from the ground up. The overall moods that Narciso Rodriguez created for me were bravery and perseverance, which are powerfully conveyed through his parents' story."
982	12808	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was the mood that you don't have to have lots of money or a big house you just have to have your family to support each other. This central theme is woven throughout the narrative, highlighting how the family's bond provided strength and comfort. The memoir illustrates that material wealth was secondary to the love and mutual support found within the home. Despite any external hardships, the family unit remained a constant source of resilience and happiness. This powerful feeling of familial devotion is the prevailing mood of the entire piece, leaving a lasting impression on the reader about what truly matters in life.
983	12809	5	3	The mood the author has in this memoir is happiness. He states that growing up around in the environment gave him a sense of family, and he says that here in his house felt like Cuba. This recreation of their native culture within the home fostered a warm and joyful atmosphere. He and his whole family have respected each other and others, which contributed to this positive and uplifting feeling. The author’s recollections are filled with a genuine and deep-seated contentment. That's the author's mood, one of fond remembrance and heartfelt happiness derived from his strong family ties.
984	12810	5	3	"A sense of community, selflessness, and contentment washes over Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of his first home. Happiness was prevalent over this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and parties with people, young and old, tall and short, of all different cultures, all sharing in the joy. The words that weave this well-written memoir are nothing if not content. Community is also emphasized in this written work. ""A close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism in that time really gives the memoir a strong communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memoir. A whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life, his parents rarely did things for their own benefit, always putting their family first. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given up, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life and future. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a love of community, happiness, and selflessness, which together paint a vivid and moving portrait of his early life."
985	12811	5	3	The mood created in the memoir were all different. They talk about their family, friends, and how they turned an apartment into a place called home, infusing it with love and personal history. They talk about their cultures and what they do for fun with friends, and family, sharing traditions and creating new memories together. He also talked about sad moments and happy moments; he didnt get to know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba in paragraph one, which added a layer of poignant longing to the narrative. This mix of emotions reflects the complex reality of their immigrant experience. Ultimately, the memoir captures a full spectrum of feelings associated with building a new life while holding onto one's heritage.
986	12812	5	3	"In the memoir ""Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives,"" Narciso Rodriguez created a mood that was profoundly calming, and the author's tone was deeply passionate in what he said, ultimately fostering a happy and warm mood. He recalls, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This quote effectively shows that the overall mood was cheerful and calm, filled with sensory richness. The author further cultivated a mood emphasizing the friendliness of family and the deep bonds of friendship, not only within his immediate family but also in how other people from the neighborhood would regularly join them in his family house. This sense of inclusive community was fundamental, as the author made the mood feel like an instilled environment; he explains that growing up in ""this environment instilled in me a great sense of 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" highlighting a powerful, expansive definition of kinship that was rooted in shared experience and mutual affection."
987	12813	5	3	"While reading the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, I felt a certain prevailing mood that was very serious and deeply grateful. In the text, Narciso said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a statement which clearly shows he is thankful for all his parents did to nurture him and make him the man he is today. He also writes with considerable reflection, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That particular statement is a serious and profound thought that clearly came from the heart, revealing a mature perspective on human connection. It shows he has a capacity for love and acceptance for anyone who comes close to him, extending beyond traditional ties. To add further evidence, he notes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage,"" a remark that says he thinks about his parents with immense respect for their heart and bravery, and that feeling combines both seriousness and gratefulness. In closing, I would like to say that through his reflective and appreciative words, Narciso Rodriguez reveals himself to be a very grateful and serious man, shaped by the sacrifices and values of his parents."
988	12814	5	3	The mood created by the author is that of the American dream, a very happy and successful theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants who hopefully had similar stories of aspiration and fulfillment. In each paragraph, there are lines that have a direct relation with friends being considered family and how his home was physically quaint but emotionally it was a vast place of love and security. That specific contrast enhances the mood of happiness in the story, making the warmth of the home more significant than its modest structure. Also, the fact that in the story, issues like racism and segregation were set aside in his community, and neighbors were treated as relatives because of who they were not where they came from, fosters a powerful sense of unity. That is what everyone loves to hear, and it makes the mood one of hope that the whole nation could one day act like that inclusive community. Lastly, the story tells at various times how the parents made significant sacrifices for their son's better life, a theme that has probably touched most readers close to home, so the mood would understandably become very serious and reflective. This short memoir is a great story to bring your mood from sad to hopeful and thankful that you live in a place you can truly call home, celebrating the enduring spirit of family and opportunity.
989	12815	5	3	"In the excerpt from the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, he maintains a specific mood or feeling throughout the whole piece. His mood seemed to be kind of like a consistently happy and optimistic one that shows everything, even the hard times he mentions like ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed the United States,"" in a reflective yet ultimately positive tone or mood. He even explained how his parents left their country and friends to live here and have what he describes as ""hard, menial jobs,"" yet he presents this struggle in a lighter, happier mood, focusing on the love and courage that defined their journey rather than the hardship itself. I believe that Narciso Rodriguez prefers to look at everything in a happy, light mood no matter what it is, choosing to emphasize the positive outcomes and the strength of his family's bonds over the challenges they undoubtedly faced."
990	12816	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one, sustained by specific memories and reflections. A primary reason why I think this is because of his descriptions of how he and his neighbors, who were of different descent, all got along very well in solidarity with one another, which creates a strong and palpable sense of love and community. Also, when he talks about particularly happy times, like when he and his family are cooking together in the kitchen, he depicts them as having a genuinely good time, filled with laughter and the vibrant sounds of Cuban Music, which adds to the joyful atmosphere. Lastly, the recurring theme of when he and his family take in relatives or even just really close friends who they consider family conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and unconditional love, defining the home as a sanctuary of acceptance and joy. This consistent focus on communal harmony and familial joy firmly establishes the memoir's uplifting and affectionate tone.
991	12817	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is compassion. Throughout the memoir it talks about how Narciso was grateful to his parents for their ""love and sacrifice"". He was grateful that they wanted to move to the United States from Cuba just to ensure that he would have a better life. He learned generosity and how important family and friends are from his parents and they have been ""the basis"" of his life. His house welcomed everyone and the air was always filled with ""not just scent and music but life and love."" He learned what family really meant and learned how to love. He loved his parents a lot and talked highly of them in his memoir ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" This deep appreciation for his parents' selfless journey and the loving environment they created is precisely why the mood in the memoir is one of profound compassion."
992	12818	5	3	"The author of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful. It shows the hardships his family had to overcome as well as the good that came from it all. The author states in his memoir that, although his family was going through tough times, they left their door wide open to family that needed help and always had the thought of others in their mind. He explains how hard it was for his parents to leave their home and jobs in Cuba, but that they did it for him, so he would get to live a better life. One more thing the author said in the memoir that was very touching was when he said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me..."" These words show us how much of an impact his parents' actions had on him and how they helped him in life, shaping his character. These are some examples of how the author describes the mood of gratitude and resilience."
993	12819	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is very appreciative and grateful. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, is grateful and appreciative for his Cuban culture and is also amazed that his parents could be so courageous to leave Cuba, to come to the United States. The author shows he is grateful and appreciative for his Cuban culture by expressing the way he feels about the ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day)."" He is also appreciative and grateful that his parents were such great cooks by saying ""our traditional Cuban home, the heart of which was the kitchen"" and how ""it was in warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air."" The author is also appreciative that his parents were so courageous to move to the United States by saying ""I will always be grateful my parents love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" The author was very grateful and appreciative for his parents and this memoir for their cooking skills and courageousness, and he is also very grateful that he is Cuban and is grateful for his culture, a sentiment that defines the entire narrative."
994	12820	5	3	"The mood of the memoir was him being very thankful of his parents. This is shown when he says ""In reality there is no way to show how grateful of my Family I am."" This shows that he holds deep respect and admiration for all of his family. His appreciation extends to the lessons they taught him and the sacrifices they made on his behalf, which formed the foundation of his values and his successful life. The overarching feeling throughout his recollections is one of profound thankfulness for the family that supported him."
995	12821	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic. He tells us about his life in the past, of the house he used to live in and how much happiness it brought him. He tells us how they called the people to celebrate when they came to America for the first time. But he doesn't only tell us what good times he had; he also told us how hard it was for him to live in Cuba. This balance of fond remembrance with the acknowledgment of past struggles creates a complex and heartfelt mood of nostalgia, reflecting on a journey that was both difficult and deeply meaningful.
996	12822	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a ""happy"" or ""joyful"" mood. I chose those moods because one, it showed how peaceful and loving everyone was even if they weren't family, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This idea of a chosen family created a warm and inclusive atmosphere. Two, he said how happy he was for his unselfish parents, ""I was always greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more couragous thing than I could have ever done"". His deep appreciation for their actions adds to the overall positive feeling. Finally, he explains how different everyone was, and yet can get along with each other so well, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This harmony among diverse people reinforces the joyful and uplifting mood. In conclusion, this is the mood I think the author created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez."
997	12823	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez is eternally grateful to have the rich culinary skills and a love for cooking just like his Parents, which were passed down to him in a nurturing environment. His very happy he came from such friendly family, where warmth and support were always present. The community and neighborhood comes together to help out those who needs a hand, demonstrating a collective spirit of generosity. Rodriguez is grateful to his Parents for their love and sacrifice, and he thanks them repeatedly for the courageous life they built. His Parents have there arms and doors open to those who will do the same for them, embodying the reciprocal kindness that defined his upbringing.
998	12824	5	3	"The mood created by the author is very greatfull and thankful. The author shows how greatful and thankful they are in this memoir When they said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their Strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me With their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life."" This profound and heartfelt expression of thanks permeates the entire narrative, leaving no doubt about the author's deep feelings. In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful."
999	12825	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez. First, the mood is family-friendly. This is because in paragraph two, the author states ""the innocence of child hood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This description evokes a sense of safety and communal joy. Also, the mood is very joy ful. In paragraph four, the author states, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This unity adds a layer of celebratory happiness to the memoir. Ultimately, the mood of this memoir is defining the love of his family. In paragraph five, Narciso states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This direct statement of gratitude anchors the entire piece in a tone of loving appreciation. These have been some moods in this story that together create a heartfelt and positive narrative."
1000	12826	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he tells where they live, how there house is, who lives there and the familys names, providing a vivid picture of his origins. The mood of the story is happy, characterized by a sense of contentment and familial bliss. They all want to be to gether and be a happy family, sharing in each other's company and lives. They are telling you where the parents are from and when they moved here, highlighting their journey and the foundation they built. There is alot of love in there family, which is the central force binding them all together. The parents turned a simple house into a home, filling it with warmth and cherished memories that define the author's upbringing.
1001	12827	5	3	I think the mood of the author in the memoir is thankful, proud, and happy. The author is extremely thankful for what he has, despite the challenges that have happened through his life. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and remains proud of it today, which is evident as he listens to Cuban music and cooks Cuban food. Also, he is genuinely happy. In the memoir, he maintains a very happy tone because he is both proud and thankful. His parents were immigrants from Cuba, and he still received the education he wanted, even though his parents went through tough times to provide these opportunities for him. This deep sense of gratitude and cultural pride culminates in a narrative that is overwhelmingly positive and affirming.
1002	12828	5	3	In the memoir the author had a certain mood. The mood of the article is somewhat happy because the author is remembering good things from his past. The author is reminiscing and being grateful for being who he is and for the experiences that shaped him. Narciso is remembering and bringing us through his heritage and home, which is described in a happy and warm setting. The mood of the article is happy, which the memoir effectively conveyed through these fond recollections and a sense of peaceful nostalgia that ties the entire piece together.
1003	12829	5	3	The mood of this story is happy. I think this because in the memoir it talks about Cuban fiestas, being with family, and friends, and it seems like it's a good time filled with laughter and joy. Also, I think this because it talks about good memories, which is always a happy thing to recall and share. And it's all about celebrations and being together, which is always a good thing that fosters a sense of community and belonging. This consistent focus on positive communal experiences firmly establishes the story's uplifting and cheerful atmosphere.
1004	12830	5	3	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich childhood the author had, from his home itself to all his family; he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents and their sacrifices. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good, radiating a profound sense of appreciation and joy for his upbringing."
1005	12831	5	3	"In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso shows a certain love and passion toward his family and culture. The mood of this memoir would be love and passion because of the words and emphasis on his feelings. For instance, in paragraph three it states that family does not mean just blood relations. He talked about how all sorts of cultures came together as one and were always good friends along the way. Another way mood is expressed is through his foreshadowing, showing how he kept the tradition going. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" He expresses his foreshadowing in two ways, by adding parentheses and just stating it. A third example of the mood in this memoir is the way he talked about the love for his family, and how important being thankful is. ""I have always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Narciso also states he can't thank his parents enough, and if they taught him none of that he would not be who he is as a person today. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Just adding the love and culture to one's house can turn it into a caring home, and this sentiment perfectly encapsulates the memoir's heartfelt and passionate mood."
1006	12832	5	3	"Narciso was profoundly grateful for his parents, who had experienced love, happiness, depression, and perhaps more throughout their lives. The author's memoir was tinged with sadness, but it was ultimately a loving memoir. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso loved his parents for transforming a simple house into a vibrant, traditional Cuban home. He also cherished how his parents imbued their own home with such personal character. ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Narciso was so grateful he thanked his parents every day for having created a foundation of love. ""It was this simple house that my parents celebrated my first birthday."" He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of how he came to America, a place filled with loving, caring, and cheerful memories that shaped his life."
1007	12833	5	3	"The author of the story creates a specific mood to help really emphasize the point of his narrative. Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to America and tried to find new jobs and start new lives in a foreign land. Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Vividly, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always seated around the table, sharing meals and stories. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant and welcoming mood in this memoir, highlighting the warmth of his community."
1008	12834	5	3	"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what it is. Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because, as Narciso says, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" Instead of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised in a wonderfully cultural environment. An environment filled with his ""family."" When he says family he doesn't mean just his biological family. He means all the people that he spent time with and had a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, grateful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home."" This reflective and appreciative sentiment is what defines the tone of this memoir."
1009	12835	5	3	"The mood of the author is predominantly happy. The mood is happy because he doesn't really mention any significant negative thoughts or feelings at all throughout the recollection. He mentions repeatedly how he is so grateful for his family, like his mom and dad, and their journey. He talks about himself being Cuban, and how proud he is to be Cuban, celebrating his heritage. The narrator has a multitude of good thoughts and fond memories about his mother and father. He mentioned in the story ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He always tells his parents of how proud he is of them, and mentions how they are basically an inspiration to him, which solidifies the positive emotional atmosphere."
1010	12836	5	3	The mood of the author in the memoir is deeply connected to his personal experience, for the author was there and lived there; consequently, the mood was genuinely happy. He was happy that his parents gave him a cherished home and also gave them the freedom to start over for their son, providing him with new opportunities and a foundation for his future. This sense of gratitude and contentment defines the emotional core of his recollection.
1011	12837	5	3	The mood in the memoir shifts throughout the story, evolving with the family's experiences. First is that in the beginning, Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different and unfamiliar. But that changed when they started having family over and also using their imagination to decorate their house, which brought them joy. Next is that the mood changed in the middle of the memoir when they realized you can have just as good a life in @LOCATION1 then you can anywhere else, finding contentment in their new surroundings. Also, by them having their family with them while in @LOCATION1 made their moods more positive and secure. Lastly the family's mood was negative when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made their house into a home their mood changed immediately and they were happy in @LOCATION2. That is the shifting mood created by the author in the memoir, showing a journey from uncertainty to happiness.
1012	12838	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood centered on warmth and community. He talks about family, love, and home, illustrating these concepts with vivid memories. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing, creating a lively atmosphere. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are to everyone around them. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love,"" a feeling that permeated every room. I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too, making it a truly special place."
1013	12839	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memoir, reflecting on his family's journey. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents, who sacrificed for his future. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States, facing great challenges. He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that deeply. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions alive in their new home. In Narciso's three room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2), creating a familiar and comforting environment. Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is, a place built on love. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3), a testament to their effort. For these things, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood throughout his narrative."
1014	12840	5	3	"The author created a warm, loving mood throughout the memoir, emphasizing community and shared experiences. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends,... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This quote represents a warm mood because he talks about what he loves, such as Cuban music, and how friendship and family really come together to form his life growing up in a supportive environment. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This quote clearly represents a loving mood throughout the memoir because, like the first quote, it represents friendship and family, but also represents love and caring between all members of his childhood community, showing the reader that the community cares for each other, and they are all loving of each other unconditionally. The mood changed near the end as well, becoming more hopeful. It turned into totally love and warmth, but also happiness for the future. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) this shows happiness because even though they are poor when they arrive in @LOCATION1, they are still celebrating the possibilities that are facing them with optimism and joy."
1015	12841	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set through specific details of his home life. The first way this mood is set is by the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals that filled the house. Rodriguez writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (p. @NUM1). This quote exentuates the mood of family because the music and food of their nationality gives a feeling of comfort and shared heritage. The comfort with your family adds to the mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house, which encouraged closeness. Rodriguez writes,""... I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building..."" (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family, fostering strong bonds. This also adds a cozy feel to the environment, making it intimate. Finally, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives, creating an extended support network. Rodriguez writes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby"" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it exentuates the number of family members which exentuates the mood of family and togetherness. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed through these interconnected elements."
1016	12842	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is happy because she said growing up in this environment instilled in her a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This is saying that she is happy for what she has in her life. She is expressing a deep appreciation for the loving community that surrounded her, which provided a strong foundation of support and belonging. She is saying that she has a nice family, friends, and a good home, and this sense of chosen kinship is the source of her enduring happiness and positive outlook."
1017	12843	5	3	The author of this memoir creates a very calm mood. This article isn't anywhat exciting at all, as it lacks dramatic events or intense conflict. All it is doing is explaining this child's life in a straightforward, narrative manner. This memoir, to me, was like taking a list of things and putting them into a full paper, detailing daily experiences and familial interactions. The author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading on this topic, as the pacing was slow and reflective. This memoir did however express a lot of feelings though, with a quiet intensity. It expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent, showing a profound sense of thankfulness. Although this memoir had a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful, conveying complex emotions through simple recollections.
1018	12844	5	3	"One mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home, vibrant with sensory details. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced many hardships, revealing their resilience. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship, a lesson learned through experience. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" These combined moods paint a complete picture of a formative and loving upbringing."
1019	12845	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is touching because I feel like it is a genuine memory story. This story is telling you how to be memorized about the story and it makes you cry a little bit with its heartfelt sincerity. I kind of like it a little bit because its about Cuban peoples and offers a glimpse into a specific cultural experience. I think my father knows people from Cuban and I think he knows their culture, which makes the story feel more personal and connected to real life, adding to its emotional resonance and touching nature.
1020	12846	5	3	"The mood of the @CAPS1 is happy. In the memior, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of living in her small home in New Jersey, recalling the warmth and joy within its walls. He describes how his family, which consisted of her mother and father turned their @CAPS2 house into a cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times, creating a bustling and supportive environment. In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather for celebrations. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be, a place filled with love. The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life who brought it joy. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" In this @CAPS5 he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love, a true sanctuary. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family, and that is the ultimate source of its happy mood."
1021	12847	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood the author creates is a profound love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1, he explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative, meaning that you don't have to be biologically related to someone to consider them family. This idea is vividly illustrated in paragraph @NUM1, where Narciso describes how so many extended family members and others would come in and out of his house all the time, and they were always treated with genuine love and kindness. The fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it truly shows the love and warmth the family possessed, welcoming not only their own relatives but also refugees from places other than America into their fold. This expansive and inclusive definition of family is a central theme that underscores the entire narrative."
1022	12848	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is overwhelmingly welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1, where he fondly described his neighborhood, saying, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Through this, he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other with open arms, creating a strong and supportive community. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author highlights the selfless nature of his parents, who came to @LOCATION1 to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their beloved home country behind. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memories of his home, where he celebrated birthdays, parties, and family gatherings, noting that there was a palpable scent of life and love in the air. For all of this, he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of ""family"" from their example."
1023	12849	5	3	The mood of the memoir is nostalgic and filled with happiness as the author reflects on his past. He tells the readers about his economic background, providing context for the humble yet rich environment of his upbringing. He also explains in detail what his family meant to him, emphasizing the deep bonds and affection that defined their relationships. Then, he talks fondly about his house and about how he celebrated his birthday there, recalling specific, joyful events that contributed to the overall positive tone. Those are some key examples that illustrate how the author effectively creates this warm and reflective mood throughout his writing, leaving the reader with a sense of cherished remembrance.
1024	12850	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep pride in his family, their cultural background, and the way he grew up. In the memoir, it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a statement that encapsulates his profound appreciation. Narciso clearly loves his parents and the way they raised him, viewing their journey and efforts as a source of strength and identity. This sense of gratitude and pride permeates the narrative, showing how his upbringing and family values have positively shaped the person he became. The memoir stands as a tribute to their enduring influence on his life."
1025	12851	5	3	The mood in this story is very happy and uplifting, created through the author's positive reflections. Firstly, the author consistently maintained a good mood and a positive outlook, no matter what challenges arose or what his parents were unable to provide. He had great sensory memories, such as the kitchen always smelling good from home-cooked meals, and he also loved the vibrant sounds of Cuban music that filled his home. Secondly, he showed how profoundly thankful he was towards his family for bringing him into this world and for their unwavering care and dedication. These two elements—the cherished sensory details and the deep-seated gratitude—show how Narciso Rodriguez made this a genuinely happy and heartwarming passage to read, celebrating the joy found in family and memory.
1026	12852	5	3	The author of this memoir created many moods. One mood that was felt is happiness because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations, a vibrant environment filled with music and the aromas of home cooking. Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso, making a profound sacrifice for his future. The last mood is admiration at the fact the Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the society, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble, yet they maintained their spirit and close bonds. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his inspirational story, effectively conveying the complex emotions of his upbringing.
1027	12853	5	3	I think the mood in this story was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage, which provided him with a strong sense of identity and belonging. And learn about all the cooking, which connected him to his cultural roots and family traditions. He seems to have had a very nice childhood and has always thanked his parents for that, expressing his deep appreciation for the life they built. they gave up everything to go to america to raise him and he seems very grateful for their selfless decision and the opportunities it afforded him.
1028	12854	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, she uses key terms and phrases to discuss the mood in paragraph @NUM1 she says, ""Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This line puts a clear picture in your head of what it would be like to have lived in that home, evoking a sense of warmth and cultural richness. Another time Narciso Rodriguez puts a clear picture of the setting in your head is in paragraph @NUM2. She is stating where her parents must live and says, ""braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics."" This line puts the setting in my mind which makes it more clear to picture the home and setting, highlighting the contrast and their sense of longing. Narciso does a great job describing the mood of each location, allowing the reader to fully immerse themselves in the emotional landscape of the memoir."
1029	12855	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of gratefulness and happiness. The memoir shows a passionate explanation of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents came to the land of @LOCATION1, leaving behind their homeland for the promise of a new beginning. It shows how happy he is that he can live in @LOCATION1, and lead his own life, pursuing the opportunities his parents worked so hard to provide. He is, and will always be, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life, a sentiment that forms the core of his reflection. His gratefulness also affects how his parents raised him, as a Cuban, instilling in him a deep appreciation for his heritage and their sacrifices. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is grateful for his family above all else, and this profound thankfulness is the dominant feeling conveyed.
1030	12856	5	3	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the author uses a large array of vocabulary and creates his sentences in such a way that one can easily register the author's mood of love, happiness, and appreciation of his home and community. ""For instance when he described the harmony and friendship within his neighborhood despite nationality, which was quite contradictory to the times ""In our neighborhood... all of these culture came together in Solidarity and friendship"". His word choice and constant repetition of words such as love, grateful, & self-less reinforce this image/atmosphere of love "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Ultimately, the author's thoughtfully crafted and retrospective composition especially how vividly he describes it as a place so near & dear to him gives room to the mood of underlying gratitude & love, leaving the reader with a powerful sense of his heartfelt appreciation."
1031	12857	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is described in many ways. To start off with, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that FAMILY had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Quite the contrary, his neighborhood was made up mostly of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. Rodriguez will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He's often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done. It was here where he learned the real definition of ""family"" through the community's support and his parents' example. He will never forget his house and his gracious neighborhood, and he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a true home filled with love and acceptance."
1032	12858	5	3	In this article, the reader is given information about the main character's life and his caring parents. The author's mood in this article is grateful, happy, and amazed. The author is so grateful that his parents would do such a brave, courageous thing for him, moving to a new country to secure his future. It makes him amazed that his parents would make that profound sacrifice for him to live a great, happy life, a sentiment that fills him with profound respect. The author feels he will never be able to show all of his appreciation towards his parents, for they did a great and selfless thing for him, which shapes his entire outlook. That is what this article conveys about the author's perspective and emotional state.
1033	12859	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the person telling the story is deeply grateful to his parents for moving so that they could have a better life. The people that were around them in their new neighborhood were like their family, even though they weren't blood relatives. The parents weren't selfish, and they helped if people needed help and let people stay if they needed a place to stay, creating a strong sense of community. The parents moved to make a better life for their family, even if it meant leaving everything familiar behind, demonstrating their profound love and commitment. This act of courage and generosity defined the author's understanding of what a true family represents."
1034	12860	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is caring and loving. The author explains, throughout the memoir, how his parents were caring and loved to help others, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere in their home. He says that his parents ""always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family,"" showing their open-hearted nature. He explains how his parents had left their great jobs, friends, and family in Cuba, so that their children would have a better life and more opportunities. The author says that his parents helped him discover the real meaning of family through their actions and unwavering support, a lesson he carries with him always."
1035	12861	5	3	The mood of this memoir is complex, involving struggle and not so good times, but also profound gratitude. In the beginning, it tells you all about his parents and a lot more about their sacrifices. It talks about being born in a simple house, and that contributes to the mood of struggle there, too. So, towards the end of the memoir, the author starts to talk about the difficult things, like not being able to find the kind of job they deserved, and that is not a very positive thing he discusses. But in the end, the author discovers the definition of family, and that mood is awesome and uplifting. Then he learned there about love in the simple house and to never forget how his parents turned the simple house into a home. So the mood is ultimately a mix of struggle, difficult times, and the awesomeness of love and discovery.
1036	12862	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that they feel more responsible to help support themself more than anyone else does as they grow from young to older. This sense of self-reliance developed from having been living off their own while being away from their families. The author reflects on this journey of independence, which fostered a strong feeling of personal capability. I think the mood of the author is that they feel good about themself and happy to have a better life from the past until now. They learn more about themself as their mood becomes happy and joyful about themself for ""having a better life,"" appreciating the growth and stability they have achieved through their own efforts. This overall feeling of contentment and self-satisfaction defines the memoir's tone."
1037	12863	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, *Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives*, the mood created by the author is appreciative. Narciso Rodriguez is deeply thankful of his parents and other friends and family for helping him through his life. He repeats several times throughout the memoir the appreciation he has for his parents, family, and friends. In one paragraph, it quotes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage... They came selflessly..."" This describes how he respects his parents so much for their sacrifice and the difficult choices they made. Another paragraph states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" In this quote, Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for loving him and their sacrifice. Then, he gives appreciation to the caringness he had during his childhood, which includes his neighbors, friends, and family, all of whom contributed to his upbringing. Narciso Rodriguez is appreciative of his family, especially his parents, for the generosity for the betterness of his life, a sentiment that resonates throughout his writing. In the memoir, *Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is gratitude and appreciation for his parents generosity, care, selflessness, and sacrifice, forming the emotional core of his narrative."
1038	12864	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains where he lived as a child very vividly, from the air mixed with the aromas of Cuban food to the Cuban music the author still loves today. These sensory details paint a picture of a vibrant and loving environment. It seems like he had a good childhood, filled with warmth and cultural richness. He says his parents were selfless and took in refugees in their home, an act of kindness that adds to the positive atmosphere. It gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad, creating a sense of familiarity and comfort for the reader. He makes the story very personal with all the family members he explains, sharing anecdotes that highlight their characters and bonds. His parents did the very best they could for their family, and this unwavering effort and love are what set the happy and joyful mood of the story.
1039	12865	5	3	In the memoir, what was the mood created by the author? First, I feel that the mood created by the author is both happy and sad. I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to a new location where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. This departure from their homeland was a source of profound loss. They also struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships in an unfamiliar environment. Although they were sad, I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved, they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was their home and each other because they have their home just as they like it, reminiscent of when they were back home, which provided a crucial sense of stability and comfort. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir, a complex mix of emotions reflecting the challenges and consolations of their new life.
1040	12866	5	3	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up, foundational elements that shaped his character. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage... I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him, an act he holds in the highest esteem. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents, a dual sentiment that honors their legacy and his profound debt to them."
1041	12867	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author was love, and inspiration. The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them. He feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family, such as providing constant support and guidance. So he is proud of them. He is also grateful to have parents like this because they do so much for him; they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected from harm. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration; this mood is created because of what he says: ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says that he is thankful for all they have sacrificed, which inspires him to be a better person. These are some examples of the mood that was created, showing a deep appreciation for family."
1042	12868	5	3	The mood created by the author is love and appreciation. Because the author talks about how growing up was a positive experience filled with family support. The author helps with babysitting, showing a sense of responsibility and care for others. And the author sounds like a nice person who values these formative experiences. The tone is warm and reflective, focusing on the good feelings associated with family life. That is what the author's mood is, one of fond remembrance and gratitude.
1043	12869	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there are various different moods. The main mood is thankful. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez expresses a thankful mood. In paragraph one, there is an example of this thankfulness: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (Rodriguez, paragraph one). This proves how Narciso acknowledges the immense sacrifice of his parents, and thanks them for it. In paragraph three, Narciso states that, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" (paragraph three). This proves how Narciso Rodriguez directly thanks his parents for what they did for him, highlighting his deep gratitude. In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a thankful mood through his reflections on his parents' journey."
1044	12870	5	3	The first paragraph was kind and happy because they came to the U.S.A. and that after living for a year was a happy time. In 1961 he was born and they were living in a simple house, situated in a two-family blond-bricks building in the Ironbound section of Newark. There was also an unhappy aspect because his parents shared the same kitchens with another family, which could be difficult. This contrast shows a mix of emotions about their early life, where hope was tempered by the challenges of crowded living. Ultimately, the memory contains both the joy of a new beginning and the hardship of their situation.
1045	12871	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood, that's sort of calming. The author explains how the house was very comfortable for him, a place of safety and warmth. Narciso explains how his parents were caring and selfless all the time, always putting their children's needs first. I think that creates a very calming and caring mood, one of security and affection. Also in paragraph one it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" which again creates a caring mood of deep appreciation. This overall feeling of contentment and thankfulness defines the memoir's emotional tone."
1046	12872	5	3	The mood the author creates is one of profound gratefulness. @CAPS1 is grateful for many things, beginning with the culinary skills and love of cooking that were passed on from her parents. @CAPS1 is also grateful for her close-knit community, which is composed of honest, hard-working immigrants who always extend a helping hand. But the biggest reason @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS2 her family. @CAPS1 is grateful for her countless family and extended family members who regularly join them for meals and who sometimes stay with them temporarily. @CAPS1 is also mostly grateful for her parents directly. @CAPS1 is grateful that her parents are @CAPS3 nice and always keep their arms and door open for help, knowing they would do the same for others. @CAPS1 is also majorly grateful for their immense courage to come to a new world without knowing any of the language or culture, a journey undertaken just to give their children a better life. @CAPS1 is grateful her parents had to make a huge sacrifice just for her benefit, leaving behind their friends, family, and careers in the country they love. @CAPS1 is also grateful for both the personal and financial struggles her parents had to go through, including braving the harsh northern winters. For her culinary heritage, her love of food, her family, and her parents' profound sacrifices, @CAPS1 will be forever grateful.
1047	12873	5	3	"This memoir really sets a mood of love and comfort. It does this when the author tells us that his parents immigrated to a new country just for him, demonstrating their deep devotion. The mood continues when he describes all the people that come over regularly for dinner, creating a warm and bustling atmosphere. His parents clearly loved him and made a great environment for him, just as he said when he noted that they ""made a house a home."" This feeling of security and affection is the central emotional tone of the entire narrative."
1048	12874	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author was powerful and immersive. It had made one feel as though you were actually there within that vibrant setting. The author had explained in detail his living environment of a small house in a community of other immigrants like themselves, a group who had banded together in rough times to support one another. During the memoir the author tells about his Cuban background, vividly recalling how ""Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also tells about @CAPS1's definition of family, which included not just those who were blood-related but also the neighbors who looked after each other as a single unit. The author successfully sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community, and how his simple three-room apartment, filled with such life and connection, truly became a home."
1049	12875	5	3	Throughout the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates many different and complex moods. As a reader, I experienced a large variety of emotions from the author's account. Such feelings included sorrow for the family and what they went through during their struggles, and pity for the children as they watched their parents strive and sacrifice for them. Yet at the same time, the children benefited from witnessing this resilience because it ultimately made them stronger individuals. Though throughout the memoir, among all of the other moods that are portrayed, there is the overarching mood of eternal gratefulness. The fact that the parents went through so much hardship just for their kids to have a better life and a promising future is beyond the realm of simple words. Words do not exist that can fully describe how amazing those parents are to have done what they did for their family. This is the powerful mood, and collection of moods, that are so effectively portrayed in this memoir.
1050	12876	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is that of a happy and hopeful atmosphere. The memoir is about a Cuban family who wants to live in America to give their son a better life and more opportunities. Their parents gave up their prestigious jobs of being scientists for their son, showing the depth of their commitment. The story is in a good mood because there is true love being spread throughout the family's actions and decisions. Ultimately, Narciso Rodriguez lived in a happy mood, nurtured by the loving sacrifices that surrounded him from the very beginning."
1051	12877	5	3	"The mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one. Many times during the story, especially in paragraph @NUM1, he told us what his parents did, but also after almost every sentence in parentheses he would say how much it meant to him. For example, he says how his parents cooked, and after that: (and for which I am eternally grateful). This shows how much he loved his parents for passing on their culinary skills. In one paragraph, he starts off the sentence with: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again shows the mood of gratefulness, happiness, and reflectiveness from the story, as he looks back fondly on the lessons and love they provided him. The consistent expression of thankfulness throughout the narrative solidifies this reflective and appreciative tone, making it a central theme of his recollection."
1052	12878	5	3	"The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was each other which gives off a great sense of family and unity in the face of the unknown. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the circumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy, as the warmth of his family made any physical dwelling a place of joy and comfort. Their shared experiences and mutual support were the foundation of their contentment in a new land."
1053	12879	5	3	"The mood in the memoir changes, but overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home. ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him. ""The faith that is struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" This profound sacrifice, while hopeful for the future, is rooted in a deep sense of loss and sadness for what was left behind."
1054	12880	5	3	There in family cubana to father come to 1956 for good future for you family. @CAPS1 have one apatarme of two room who @CAPS1 have two son in @CAPS3 A bay or boy @CAPS1 twinty one And @CAPS3 twinty seven. The father made this difficult journey to provide new opportunities, leaving behind his familiar life in Cuba. The small apartment with only two rooms was a humble beginning for the family in their new country. Despite the cramped living conditions, this move was a foundational step toward building the better future he envisioned for his two sons and his entire family. This initial struggle was the price paid for the chance at a improved life.
1055	12881	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates a mood that is calm and comfortable. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" that shows that his house is without no yelling or fighting, but was instead filled with positive sensory experiences. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home"" that shows while he grew up his home was comfortable for him, a place of social warmth and security. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""the kitchen in this humble house where a @LOCATION1 feast always filled the air but life and love"" that showing that his family was calm and loved each other. The author says in paragraph @NUM3 ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" that shows he was comfortable growing up in his house even though he didn't have lots of things. In conclusion, the author creates a mood for the memoir that is consistently peaceful and filled with the comfort of a loving family environment."
1056	12882	5	3	"In this memoir the author creates a mood which, for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a ""home sweet home"" mood. I say this because when he says, ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" it reminds me of my family and how my family loves cooking Puerto Rican food. The smell is like, ""your home"". In my home everyone is accepted and welcomed, even if you're not related. Narciso also expresses this sentiment of inclusivity in his memoir. Furthermore, Narciso is very grateful in his writing because his parents immigrated to have a better life, which creates a loving and family-oriented mood. Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Now that they've immigrated, Narciso Rodriguez will never forget his childhood home and the profound sense of belonging it provided. There are many moods in this memoir, but the overarching feeling is one of warmth and deep appreciation for family and heritage."
1057	12883	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the mood is a complex blend of happy, sad, and grateful. Narciso is very happy because he usually gets to spend precious time with his ""family"" and is also very happy that his family is with him and that more family will come from Cuba in a few years, giving him a sense of joyful anticipation. He is sad because he can't see his grandfather and because his parents didn't get to live such a great life as him, which introduces a layer of poignant longing. He is grateful for being alive, for his parents doing everything for him, for bringing him to the United States, and he's grateful because he got to live such a great life because of his parents' immense sacrifices. That was the multifaceted mood of the memoir, capturing the bittersweet reality of the immigrant experience."
1058	12884	5	3	The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez creates in this memoir is a very appreciative and thankful tone. In this memoir, he is expressing how profoundly thankful he is for his parents moving to the United States to give him a better life and greater opportunities. He shows deep appreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds, acknowledging the weight of their decision. At one point in this memoir, he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done, highlighting his admiration. He tells his parents this directly to let them know how incredibly brave he thinks they are for leaving everything familiar behind to ensure his future was bright and full of potential.
1059	12885	5	3	His mood was one of profound happiness derived from family. Being with his family, sharing experiences, and being gathered with your family creates a foundation of joy. Having great times with your family members, taking chances with your family, and exploring the world together strengthens these bonds. The narrative encourages you to never be afraid to go somewhere new and to always express your feelings to each other openly. It emphasizes the importance of always being there for each other, of being yourself and not changing, and of taking risks to move to a different state for new beginnings. Don't be afraid to share with one another, always be there for one another, and always be yourself. Express yourself how you want to be and don't change for anybody, for this authenticity is the source of true happiness and familial love.
1060	12886	5	3	The mood created by the author, in my opinion, is a happy and resilient mood. It is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and vivid description of his life at home, filled with warmth and security. The author created a happy mood also because it showed that his parents were not selfish and that they selflessly wanted their children to have a better life in the United States, even though they had left their whole family behind, which speaks to their love. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism and adversity. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all worked together happily and in unity, overcoming challenges as a community. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well, creating an extended support system. The story gave me a sense of a really good, close-knit family, including the importance of one, and how such bonds foster happiness even in difficult circumstances.
1061	12887	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. I think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it says ""...culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I think it's an example of pride because it says ""for which I am eternally grateful,"" showing that he will always be proud of Cuban food and the lasting legacy it represents. Another reason why I think the mood is pride is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" I also think that is an example of pride because it shows that he was raised with Cuban music and he still loves to listen to it, a clear sign of his enduring cultural pride. The author’s consistent expression of gratitude and enduring love for his heritage solidifies the overall mood of pride throughout the memoir."
1062	12888	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is very uplifting. The story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him. It also shows how happy the family was and how everyone around them were family regardless of where they immigrated from. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" which powerfully illustrates the inclusive and joyful atmosphere of his upbringing. This idea of a chosen family, bound by love and support rather than genetics, contributes significantly to the positive and heartening feeling of the narrative. The memoir ultimately conveys a powerful message about the universal nature of family and the happiness it can bring."
1063	12889	5	3	"The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to create was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows thankfulness because she's saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table, a realization that deepens her sense of gratitude. This profound appreciation for her parents' efforts and sacrifices is woven throughout her recollections. The main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness, as the author reflects on her childhood with a deep and abiding sense of gratitude."
1064	12890	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation. Narciso appreciated all that his parents did for him. They gave up a home in Cuba for him, their job and even happiness. Love because they all loved each other a lot; family meant a lot to the family. They said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related; it doesn't matter. It's about love and caring. This central theme of selfless love is evident in the parents' sacrifices and the expansive definition of family that was practiced. The narrative is consistently filled with a warm and heartfelt tone that underscores these core emotions. The memoir, therefore, successfully communicates a powerful atmosphere of love and deep appreciation for familial bonds.
1065	12891	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic, warm, and thankful. In the memoir the author explains the importance of family, recounts his experiences with family, and thanks his family for all the important life lessons they have taught him. In paragraph two the author says: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This excerpt conveys a feeling of nostalgia and warmth as the author praises his childhood home and the fond memories associated with it. In paragraph three the author says: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This sentence also makes the reader feel nostalgic and warm because the author really gives the reader a sense of his childhood community's unity and love. In paragraph five the author says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" In this sentence the author really conveys his @CAPS1 of thanks of his parents to the reader as he praises them for their bravery. In paragraph six the author says: ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and Friends are."" And later in paragraph seven: ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'Family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These excerpts really sum up the author's @CAPS1 about family. They explained to the reader how really important Family is and how thankful the author is for his family and all the life lessons they have taught him. These excerpts really convey the @CAPS1 of nostalgia, warmth, and thankfulness to the reader, creating a deeply reflective and appreciative tone that resonates throughout the entire piece."
1066	12892	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep affection and gratitude. First, the mood created by the author is that he loves to cook, a passion his parents taught him, and he is eternally grateful for their guidance. Second, his mother and father ""had come to @LOCATION1 with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. they came to give a better life to Narciso @PERSON1, leaving behind their country they loved,"" which establishes a tone of profound respect for their sacrifice. Third, his parents had a simple house, yet they always filled the air with not just the scent of food and music but with an overwhelming sense of life and love. In summary, these are the elements that create the warm and thankful mood of the author's memoir."
1067	12893	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez wrote fondly about his memories of growing up in Newark, New Jersey. He creates a mood of bliss through his loving and grateful tone, reflecting on a childhood filled with warmth. Narciso describes his neighborhood as being ""of honest, hardworking immigrants,"" and he notes that ""Growing up in this environment gave me a sense of family' that had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" A picture of kind, smiling faces is painted by this description of a tightly-knit, ever-willing to help group of people who supported one another. Rodriguez tells of his parents' creation of a beautiful home from just a house, stating, ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" Narciso's words captivate the reader with a scene of relaxed happiness, generosity, and love, where community was central. He is clearly grateful for his enviable childhood, and cares dearly for his selfless parents who fostered this environment. The piece he wrote has a loose bliss, like slowly eating a delicious truffle and savoring every moment."
1068	12894	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" demonstrates a prevailing mood of love. @ORGANIZATION1 shows his love by telling of his parents' profound influence on his life. In the @NUM1 paragraph he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" which clearly shows his deep compassion for them. This compassion stems from his parents having left Cuba and gone to @LOCATION1 to start a new life, a courageous act he deeply values. Also, they wanted a better education for their children, so they left family, friends, and everything behind so they could restart their life with hope. Another way Narciso shows love for his parents is by using the opportunities they provided to build his own life, applying the lessons they taught him. Narciso used the better education they secured for him to have a better life, which ultimately led to his success as a fashion designer. Therefore, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" he consistently shows a mood of love and appreciation throughout the narrative."

This quote shows how he was given love by his family and friends through these joyful and frequent gatherings that defined his youth. In the last sentence of the memoir, Narciso fills the reader up with this same feeling of love, stating, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

This is portrayed as happy when he talks about his heritage of being Cuban and having the advantage of being born in @LOCATION1. He also is sad, however, when he talks about how his family left their relatives in Cuba for him to be born in @LOCATION1. He likes that his family lives close by, recalling the period around 1970 when his family was allowed to come from Cuba to @LOCATION1. He also is very grateful for his parents' sacrifice to give @CAPS1 the life he has. Although he liked his neighborhoods, he is depressed to have been born into a time of racism and segregation like most immigrants faced. This complex interplay of emotions is what defined the mood portrayed in the memoir of @PERSON1."

1076	12902	5	3	He was profoundly happy to be educated just as he is, and he was deeply happy to be Cuban. Even though his parents didn't have much in terms of material wealth, he was still immensely proud of his family because, as he believes, it is not about where you live or the conditions you live in. True pride comes from being part of an honest family and knowing they stand with you through the hard moments, which is the foundation of his contentment and self-worth.

Overall, Narciso Rodriguez did a great and effective job setting this cheery, uplifting mood throughout his memoir.
1078	12904	5	3	In my opinion, I felt like his culture meant a lot to him, and I strongly felt that his house and his family and friends were all profoundly important to him. In the first paragraph, he carefully describes his family, where they lived, where they originally came from, and how old they were, and this detailed account made me think thoughtfully about my own culture and family. In the second paragraph, it tells what year he was born in and how his house was furnished and filled with life, which made me want to describe my own old house, the only house with more memories than I could possibly think of. His neighborhood is portrayed as a close, tight-knit community populated by honest, hard-working immigrants. It made me think about how all of our community could be if we were equally hard working and supportive of one another. In my opinion, his vivid memories successfully made my own cherished memories come flooding back.
1079	12905	5	3	In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1, the mood created by the author is one of excited appreciation. Narciso Rodriguez is a man that we can tell deeply appreciates what his family did for him, because in the memoir he says that he felt graceful and happy about his culture. He is proudly from Cuba, and his family are so friendly and close-knit. His family taught him lots of valuable stuff, which is why their lessons have now been the solid basis of his entire life. His friends are also important people in his story. Throughout this memoir he expresses all of this and also how intensely proud he felt about his family. His admiration for his family is truly awesome, as he learned with them how to love others and how to show respect. In the memoir he states that he would never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a loving home, which perfectly captures the grateful and excited mood created by the author.

Just how endless celebrations brought life in there warm home, creating an atmosphere of constant joy and togetherness. Narciso Rodriguez also had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, although these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This feeling of community was central to his upbringing. How there parents always had their arms and door open to many people knowing they would do the same for them, fostering a deep sense of mutual support.

To have to leave memories and friends and family is upsetting, creating a profound sense of loss and nostalgia for the life left behind. Also its better because now their lives will get better, filled with new opportunities and the promise of safety. Everything they had before they will soon have here, rebuilt through perseverance and hope in a new land. The mood created was upset but happy and excited, a bittersweet mixture that honestly reflects the challenging yet hopeful experience of starting over.
1089	12915	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, there are relevant and specific pieces of information describing the mood created by the author. This quote or textual evidence shows that the mood of the author is very ""warm"" and free: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation in the family and friends, and the celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""

This mood is great and shows anyone can be happy when they appreciate the love and community that surrounds them, regardless of their circumstances.
1091	12917	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was one of profound appreciation. Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents many times for moving to New Jersey and giving up their lives in Cuba to give him a better life. He also expresses gratitude for the richness of his childhood, recalling how they taught him so many valuable things and provided a nurturing environment for him to grow up in. When the author describes how his parents' passion for cooking was passed on to him, he explicitly pauses to thank them once more. He tells how even though his community was made up of many different races, they all lived together in friendship and unity. He fondly remembers how people always came over to the house for dinner and how there were many vibrant celebrations. He speaks of the immense courage his mother and father had in coming to a new country without any prior knowledge of the language or the culture. He reflects on how his parents, like all immigrants, left their homeland solely to give their children better lives. Narciso describes how his parents had great jobs in Cuba, gave those up willingly, and took any jobs they could find in their new home. In paragraph six he states how he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Also in that paragraph he admits there is no way to fully express the depth of gratitude he feels towards them. The last sentence of that paragraph, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life,"" serves as a final, powerful expression of thanks. Throughout the memoir he consistently describes his parents as heroes and thanks them for everything they did for him, which solidifies why the overarching mood for this memoir was appreciation."
1092	12918	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring, and it shows a deep appreciation to the author's parents. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, explains how it was for him as a kid and how his concept of ""family"" doesn't always mean a blood relative. He describes the household as being very humble, a place that always had open arms and warmly welcomed others into their home. He also says that it wasn't about the size of the home or how expensive it was; rather, it was about the people inside it, how close they were, and the cherished memories they shared together. He credits this environment for impressing the spirit of generosity upon him at an early age. All in all, through this memoir, the author shows that he is very appreciative of his family and would not change how he grew up, thanking his extended ""family"" for the invaluable lessons they taught him about love and community."
1093	12919	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with several distinct traits. One prominent trait of the mood is selflessness and courage. It is shown in a key paragraph when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This act of throwing away one's life to enter an alien world for a child's future requires immense selflessness and courage. Also, the mood is deeply characterized by gratefulness. The author shows this in another paragraph when he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This directly shows the author's gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and courage in coming over to the United States to give him a better future. Finally, a sense of unity is found in the mood. It is illustrated when the text says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the great unity in their neighborhood, a place where different races unified in a way that was uncommon elsewhere. In conclusion, the author successfully depicts a complex mood built upon these distinct and powerful traits."
1094	12920	5	3	"The author created a very positive and optimistic mood throughout the memoir. He talked about how his fascinating Cuban culture was vividly portrayed throughout his home and family life. The author said, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" a quote that effectively shows his enduring love and pride for his cultural heritage. In the memoir, the author also tells about his extreme thankfulness towards his parents, whom he deeply admired for their courage and determination. Narciso felt that his parents did all they could to give their family a good life and that they were ultimately successful in their efforts. His statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" shows the genuine and profound appreciation he holds for what they did. Furthermore, he believed that family encompasses everyone that you love and are close to, not just blood relatives, and he considered his entire community to be one giant, supportive family. This memoir maintained an upbeat tone from beginning to end, a direct result of the author's pervasive positivity and optimism."
1095	12921	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was inconsistent and ultimately frustrating for the reader. The narrative pacing at first was slow as it established the character, but then it abruptly went fast, then slow again, suggesting the writer could not control the speed of her writing throughout the story. The overall mood was jarring, forcing the reader to think fast and then think hard, and next time the writer should stay at one consistent speed, otherwise readers may give up on the story. Who knows, that story could have been the best but it just didn't want to maintain a steady pace. Also, the story was too plain and predictable, like any other story where things are bad before they get good. If the writer had gone slower with describing the story and developing the scenes, it would have been different, but within the first few minutes it felt too familiar. The rushed conclusion felt boring, and it serves as a reminder to be careful how you write or choose these stories, as you cannot know what is best for a reader you do not know. A better approach to the narrative structure is needed for future efforts.
1096	12922	5	3	In the memoir the mood was happy and loving because when they had their house their families would be welcomed in and strangers also would be welcome in, creating a constant sense of community. His parents were very loving because they were always so kind to people, offering food and conversation freely, and they would rarely get into arguments, maintaining a peaceful atmosphere. And the family was so enthusiastic and happy just because their family was together, sharing in daily joys and simple pleasures. This collective spirit of warmth and acceptance defined their home life completely.
1097	12923	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up, shaping your fundamental outlook. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable and secure in his environment. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind, always ready with a smile for guests, so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too, feeling a genuine sense of belonging. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why it leaves such a lasting, positive impression.
1098	12924	5	3	"In the memoir, the author created the mood that made it had a close relationship. The author made the relationship very close from everywhere, depicting a community bound by mutual care. In paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author gave the happiness to the cultures they have settled with the author, giving them friendship and happiness through shared experiences. The author also described their friendship with their neighbors, illustrating deep bonds. In paragraph @NUM2, he wrote, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author thinks it his family consider other families as part of their family, then the other families will consider the author's family as part of their family, creating a reciprocal network of support. Families have been always close to each other, providing a reliable foundation. The authors said he will never forget his own family. He wrote in paragraph @NUM3, ""I will never forget that home or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love."" The author shows that his close relationships of his neighborhood and all his friendships were formative. The author created a close relationship mood while he was writing his memoir, effectively conveying the profound connections that defined his youth."
1099	12925	5	3	"The mood created by the @PERSON1 in the memoir was to show how happy it was for Narciso Rodriguez growing up in a vibrant and accepting home. ""here, The innocence of childhood, The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home"" and when the @PERSON1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relitive,"" it highlights the expansive love he experienced. as you can see the mood of the story is warm and tells us about how he had a good Childhood filled with positive memories and a redefined concept of kinship that provided a strong foundation for his life."
1100	12926	5	3	"In the memoir there is more the one mood, but this is the main one that permeates the narrative. First, the author is trying to create a ""no place like home mood,"" and the author succeeds at it by evoking a deep sense of nostalgia. It seems he/she is using memory and telling his/her background to paint a picture of a cherished past. The mood was also very calm and very relaxing for the story, allowing the reader to feel the serenity of the described environment. In conclusion this is the mood the author is giving, effectively conveying a heartfelt appreciation for the comfort and uniqueness of home."
1101	12927	5	3	"In the excerpt from Narciso Rodriguez's ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" there is a specific mood set, and I think its love and generosity. For example, in the first paragraph, it says ""I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my birthdays."" This illustrates a foundation of compassion and open-heartedness, where the home was a hub for welcoming newcomers and marking personal milestones with equal warmth. The consistent theme of opening their doors to others reinforces this pervasive feeling of love and a generous spirit that defined his childhood environment, leaving a lasting impression of a nurturing and inclusive household."
1102	12928	5	3	In the memoir, the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life while also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the people that live on the street. The narrative thoughtfully acknowledges the challenges of immigrant life without dwelling on hardship, instead focusing on the richness of a shared community. Also by how he feels so comfortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family, the tone becomes inspiring and positive, celebrating the solidarity found within a diverse neighborhood.
1103	12929	5	3	"The author creates a very warm, happy, and welcoming feeling by describing how friends and family are always visiting and how happy the family is all the time. The author Narciso Rodriguez never mentions any bad times and shows how kind everyone is, focusing instead on the joy of togetherness. This quote from the memoir proves that Narciso is creating a good mood throughout the story: ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote I think shows very well that the author is creating a happy mood in his memoir by emphasizing the pure, unblemished memories of a childhood surrounded by love and constant fellowship, which defines the entire narrative's uplifting spirit."
1104	12930	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez's parents emigrated from Cuba into New Jersey, where they were not wealthy and many racial barriers stopped them from getting good jobs. However, Rodriguez, who is writing the memoir, explains how they sacrificed it all so that he could have a better life and how much they helped their neighbors and their family. Rodriguez writes a lot about how they always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family. He emphasizes this mood, a mood of ""good times"" and a neighborly love, how they treated everyone as family. The mood Rodriguez creates is one where you find the good in a life where there might not be too much good, highlighting resilience and the capacity to build a rich, loving community despite external hardships and limitations."
1105	12931	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was both loving and grateful. This was the mood of the story because the author mentioned how his home was filled with a lot of love and how he is grateful for the sacrifice that his parents made for him. In his community, that was filled with hardworking immigrants who came together in great solidarity and friendship, this sense of gratitude was amplified. The author's parents had come to the country with courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture, which he will always be grateful for. His home was always filled with life and love, a vibrant sanctuary built on sacrifice and mutual support. The author said that he would never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things he learned there about how to love, concluding with a profound appreciation for the foundation his parents built. He would never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, a sentiment that perfectly encapsulates the memoir's heartfelt and thankful tone.
1106	12932	5	3	The mood in the memoir was in a way sad, tinged with a sense of hardship and struggle. The reason why it was kind of sad is how they came into this country with nothing, facing an uncertain future in a new land. They had to live in a @NUM1 bedroom apartment, which was cramped and difficult for the entire family. Even though that they still made it up to being able to make money through relentless hard work and determination. They got a better living style too, eventually moving into a more comfortable home and achieving a measure of stability and success after their initial struggles.
1107	12933	5	3	It seems kind of happy and sad, a bittersweet mixture of conflicting emotions, though it is mostly happiness that shines through in the end. They were sad because they had to leave everything behind in Cuba, including their home, friends, and familiar way of life, which was a profound loss. Yet, this sadness was ultimately overshadowed by the hope and opportunities that awaited them, creating a complex emotional tone that acknowledges the pain of the past while embracing the promise of the future.
1108	12934	5	3	The mood in the passage is @CAPS1, reflecting the difficult circumstances they fled. It is @CAPS2 because they can give their child a better life, filled with opportunities that were previously unavailable. Next is because Cuba is not a good place to be in, with its political and economic hardships creating a desperate situation. They are @CAPS2 because they get to start a new life over, free from the constraints of their former home.

The mood created by the author in the memoir is a @CAPS2 mood. First of all I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said ""... and for wich I am eternally grateful,"" expressing a profound thankfulness for his opportunities. Also it said ""wich I adore to this Day,"" indicating a lasting and positive affection for his experiences. How I know that those where a @CAPS2 mood is because if I where to say that it be @CAPS2, also there was nothing saying that @CAPS1 disliked it, which confirms the positive tone. Second of all, @CAPS1 would all ways tell his Parents that ""I will always be grateful to my Parents for thier love and sacrifice,"" acknowledging their immense efforts. He also told them ""I've often told them of admiration for their strenth and Perseverance,"" highlighting his respect for their journey. There for the mood of the memoir is for those two reasons why it is a @CAPS2 mood that the author created, centered on gratitude and familial love."
1110	12936	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir, each capturing a different facet of its emotional landscape. One way I could describe the memoir is that it makes you feel good about things, inspiring a sense of hope and positivity.

As you can see, there are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir, all of which contribute to its uplifting and heartfelt message."
1111	12937	5	3	In the memoir when in 1961 Narciso was born into a simple house, a Cuban home filled with traditions, and the very heart of which was the kitchen. His parents, who loved to cook, instilled in him a deep appreciation for family and heritage that is still with him today and for which he is eternally grateful. The home was also filled with passionate music, which he adores to this day. His neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants like his family, creating a familiar and supportive community. His mother and father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing numerous cultural hardships. His mood shows lots of positive things about his family being proud of what he is and what he stands for, having the blood of being Cuban. He seems very pleased with his family's success and the strong foundation they provided for him.
1112	12938	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a calm and loving mood. The author first shows a loving mood when he says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This shows a loving mood because the parents wanted to give their children a better life by moving to America, even though they were leaving a lot behind, demonstrating their profound devotion. The author shows a calm mood when he says the kitchen ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" This quote puts a calm mood because when you think of filling the air with scents and playing nice music it puts you in a calm, relaxed mood. This quote also shows a loving mood as well, because it explains his love for his family and that he is proud to call them his own. All in all, the above evidence sets the memoir's mood as loving and caring, reflecting the warmth of his childhood home."
1113	12939	5	3	The author created a specific mood in the memoir that is deeply felt by the reader. The mood in the memoir is one of shared experience and communal spirit, a feeling you are compelled to share with someone even if you don't initially want to. It is an atmosphere that connects people through the common threads of family and belonging that the author describes. This evocative mood ultimately brings the reader into the heart of the author's world, creating a sense of intimacy and connection that is both powerful and inviting, leaving a lasting impression of warmth and unity.
1114	12940	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood the author created is profoundly grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso says in the opening sentence, establishing this tone of thankfulness from the very beginning. This sense of gratitude permeates the entire narrative as he reflects on the challenges they overcame. He acknowledges their courage in leaving their homeland and the hardships they endured to provide opportunities for him. This overarching appreciation for his parents' selflessness defines the emotional core of the memoir, coloring every memory with a deep and sincere thankfulness for the life they built."
1115	12941	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is very warm, happy and inviting. Since the whole story portrays this mood, I will tell you some reasons why. In the first paragraph, Rodriguez tells you how everybody in his neighborhood were good friends and would always give a hand to people in need, fostering a strong sense of community. The next paragraph goes into more detail about this, telling us how many of Rodriguez's neighbors, friends and relatives joined him and his family at dinner on a regular basis. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us,"" creating an atmosphere of generous hospitality. In a later paragraph, Rodriguez states how his parents selflessly came over to the U.S.A to give him a better life. They gave up everything they had just so he could have more than his parents did, which just goes to show how much Rodriguez's parents cared for him. As you can see, this combination of community, family, and sacrifice is why the mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and inviting, leaving the reader with a heart-warming impression."
1116	12942	5	3	I believe the author's mood was serious, reflecting a thoughtful and solemn tone throughout the text. The author approached the subject matter with a sense of gravity and deep consideration, which permeated the narrative and influenced the reader's perception. This serious mood was essential for conveying the weight of the events described, ensuring that the core message was communicated with the appropriate level of intensity and respect for the subject. The consistent use of this tone helped to underscore the importance of the themes being explored, leaving a lasting impression of the author's earnest and deliberate intent.
1117	12943	5	3	"The mood the author creates in this memoir is gratitude. The author is very grateful to his parents for all that they have sacrificed for him. For example, they came to the United States from Cuba, without a clue of its customs or language, embarking on a difficult journey into the unknown. The authors parent's left behind their careers, their families and friends, just that they can have a better life for their baby, demonstrating the depth of their commitment. The author's parents let people stay in their home so that they could get back on their feet, extending the kindness they valued. The authors gratitude is clearly shown in paragraph six when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" The author clearly states that he is grateful for all that his parents have given him. The author also says that he thinks that what his parents did for him was the ""most courageous thing [that he] could have ever done,"" a sentiment that powerfully concludes this expression of thankfulness."
1118	12944	5	3	The mood in this memior was happyness. It was happyness because he talks about how much his parents care not only about their family but also friends, creating an atmosphere of joy and contentment. This pervasive feeling of happiness stems from the depiction of a loving and supportive community, where acts of kindness and mutual care were commonplace. The author’s recollections are filled with positive interactions and a general sense of well-being that defined his upbringing. The focus on these nurturing relationships consistently reinforces the cheerful and uplifting mood of the entire narrative, leaving the reader with a strong sense of the author's fond and happy memories.
1119	12945	5	3	In the memoir, the author emphasized a very specific mood. She greatly emphasized warmth and safety. By warmth, she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones, a feeling of comfort and affection that was ever-present. It meant something you'll always remember, because it's such a remarkable feeling. By stressing this warmth, it meant that it created lasting and cherished memories. The other part of this mood was safety. The explanation of the safety was that you're surrounded by people that care about you, and there's no one to judge you, no one to hurt you, and you're safe from any dangers, fostering a perfect environment for trust and peace. I personally love the mood of this story because it's something I long for each year down the cape. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is very clear and effectively conveys its comforting and secure atmosphere.
1120	12946	5	3	"In the short story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood of the short story is grateful and reasonable. In the story a man named Narciso Rodriguez twenty-seven years old migrated from Cuba in 1956 with his parents to come to the United States. When they came they had to live in a one bedroom apt. they could afford nothing else, facing significant hardships upon arrival. But Narciso was being very greatful, maintaining a positive perspective despite the circumstances. Even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay, they persevered. So they only had little pay to feed there family. Narciso is greatful in paragraph five. The text says ""They struggle both personally and finanacially braving the harsh northern winters."" He had to settle for what was given to him at the time, demonstrating a reasoned acceptance of his situation and a thankful heart for the opportunities that did exist, which concludes the portrayal of his character."
1121	12947	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is the idea of sacrifice and generosity. @PERSON1's parents came to @LOCATION1 as immigrants from Cuba and by doing this undertook a very risky and difficult journey in order to ensure @PERSON1 would have a more successful life and future. The parents gave up seeing their families, friends and careers in the country they loved, making a profound personal sacrifice. Narciso displays generosity by saying ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" acknowledging the immense debt he feels for their selfless actions. This sentiment of thankfulness perfectly encapsulates the overall mood of the narrative, highlighting the deep appreciation for the parents' courageous decision."
1122	12948	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" by the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood was happiness because he had his heritage, family and friends, and the chance to make new lives in @LOCATION2. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Skills and love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate cuban music"". This quote is relevant because it shows that @PERSON2 is happy and proud of his heritage, which provided him with a strong sense of identity and joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it also states ""Family and friends, and celebrations that encompassed them both."" This quote is relevant to my question because it shows that friends and family made Narciso happy, creating a warm and supportive community around him. In paragraph @NUM3 it states ""In the United States they had to start over entirely taking whatever jobs they can find."" This quote is relevant to my question because it shows that Narciso's family could make whatever they wanted out of their lives, viewing the challenge as an opportunity filled with hope. That is the mood of happiness in the memoir ""@PERSON2 @CAPS1"" by Blueprints of Our Lives, stemming from cultural pride, strong relationships, and newfound possibilities."
1123	12949	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of love and sacrifice. He often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done, expressing his deep admiration. As he was growing up, his environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but was defined by love and commitment. He often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance, and he thanked them repeatedly for all they had endured. As he says, ""he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a statement that underscores the power of their love to create a nurturing and warm family life from humble beginnings. This lasting memory solidifies the central themes of love and sacrifice that define the memoir's emotional core."
1124	12950	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound admiration. For instance, in the text it says that his mother and his father had to come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. This immense personal cost highlights their bravery and deep parental love. The author's reflective tone conveys a deep respect for this difficult choice, establishing a mood that is both reverent and thankful for the sacrifices made. The narrative thus fosters a strong sense of appreciation for the parents' courageous journey.
1125	12951	5	3	"The mood that was created by the author was respect. For example, it conveyed to the boy that you don't have to be a blood relative to be considered family. For instance, the author states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" emphasizing a broad and inclusive definition of kinship. Another reason was that you should always help your family during bad times. For example, the book reads ""Countless extended family members came and went—and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet,"" demonstrating a constant readiness to offer support. Thirdly, the boy will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. For instance, the author quotes, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This combination of inclusive family values, mutual aid, and filial gratitude creates an overarching mood of deep respect throughout the memoir."
1126	12952	5	3	"The mood in this memoir I think would be happiness because his parents gave him happiness by being there all the homieness, providing a constant and comforting presence throughout his childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This show how much they've done for him and he has apreciated, recognizing their efforts to create a warm and stable environment. Overall this is reconizing that family and happiness are unified, as the love within the family unit is the direct source of his joyful feelings."
1127	12953	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", was sad. This is so because he's always talking about how he doesn't Know parts of his real family, creating a sense of incompleteness and personal loss. Furthermore, he lives in an apartment, which seems to contribute to his feelings of transience and a lack of deeper roots. This combination of an absent family history and a modest living situation establishes a consistently melancholic tone throughout the narrative."
1128	12954	5	3	"In the memoir, @PERSON1,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, has a very strong and touching mood.    In paragraph @NUM1 Rodriguez states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This line describes the mood as extremely loving and touching because he is showing how much love he dedicates to his parents For the life he lived, a life filled with their care.     Also, in paragraph @NUM1 Rodriguez states ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This line also describes the mood as very calm and loving because he is extremely grateful for the life his parents gave him, a life rich in non-material wealth.    In paragraph seven, the last scentence really describes the mood because he is know showing the love to his parents and to his house where grew up, ""I will never forget how my parents turned thes simple house into a home"" through their affection and effort.    This memoir describes the mood as extremely loving and grateful, leaving the reader with a profound sense of appreciation for family."
1129	12955	5	3	"The mood created by the author is fairly formal, with a few informal parts. For example a formal paragraph, like paragraph number one, sets the stage of the whole memoir and uses formal transitions like ""After [living]"". Also, the paragraph is very informative, telling about his parents imigrating to the @ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba and how they were financially poor + could not afford a fancy home like they could in Cuba, establishing a serious historical context. An informal paragraph in the memoir is a paragraph like number six where he is describing how thankful he is for his parents being as selfless and giving as they are. He also uses informal transitions such as ""But, [in reality]."" And ""these...,"". It also just has an informal tone to that paragraph, making it feel more personal and heartfelt. As a conclusion these parts of the memoir have a good balance of formal + informal settings to keep the reader engaged, providing both information and emotional connection."
1130	12956	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there was a mood to the memoir. The mood that was set was about how you should keep peace in the house, fostering a harmonious and supportive environment. You should be grateful and appresitive to what your parents do for you and what they give you, acknowledging their hard work and dedication. Another mood that was set is to keep yoar house open to family and friends, creating a welcoming space for loved ones. And hope they would do the same for you, reinforcing the value of reciprocity and community. And no matter if your poor or have a small house ""family"" is always there, providing unwavering support. And family ""can turn a simple house into a home"", which is the central, uplifting message of the entire narrative."
1131	12957	5	3	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates an overall mood of happiness, and some sadness at the same time. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains what it was like to live in his home in Cuba. The way he describes his experience in the kitchen cooking and listening to music gives the reader a warm feeling. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him, but they can see unity in his family and the vibrant life they shared. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was, describing a supportive network. ""It was a close-knit community of hardworking immigrants..."" On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to @LOCATION1. ""They struggled both personally and financially"" it says in paragraph @NUM3, highlighting the harsh challenges they faced. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods, creating a poignant contrast. Both happiness and sadness are shown in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" reflecting the full spectrum of his family's experience."
1132	12958	5	3	"The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir is a very good and bright. He and his parents survived hard times in their New Jersey home, such as segregation of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 like himself and not always having enough money. Yet he and his family survived because of the unity of his closely-knit community, which provided essential support. Immigrants from @ORGANIZATION2, the @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and elsewhere all came together and ignored their differences. They shared food, shared their homes, and shared happiness between them, creating a strong bond. There was a certain trust among the community, every family holding their door open for anybody,"" knowing that they would do the same for [them]."" (paragraph @NUM1) To make the mood of this excerpt very light and cheerful, Rodriguez uses words like, ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" (∂ @NUM2) ""innocence of childhood,"" (∂ @NUM2), ""hard working"", (∂ @NUM4), ""courage,"" and ""selflessly,"" (∂ @NUM5) ""grateful... love and sacrifice,"" ""admiration for their strength and perseverance,"" ""spirit of generosity."" (∂ @NUM6). All of these words and phrases show that through solidarity, hope, and courage, people can make a good life for each other, no matter how hard their situation is at first."
1133	12959	5	3	"Based on the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author in the memoir could be described in many ways. To begin with, the boy is very so grateful for his parents and adore them so much. And paragraph two it states, ""the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" @CAPS1 more, his parents left the country Cuba to have a better life for there children, showing their profound dedication. In paragraph five it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carreers in the country they love."" @CAPS2, he thanks them and admires their strenght and preserverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly,"" expressing his deep appreciation. As you can see, the mood of the memior created by the author could be described in many ways, primarily as one of gratitude and admiration."
1134	12960	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a very calm mood. For me personally home has always been a calm place, and the author evokes a similar feeling of tranquility. The author further emphasizes the mood by using words like aromas and passionate, which contribute to a warm and serene atmosphere. The author sets a calm, kind and gentle mood by talking about family and friends and the simple joys of shared moments. In conclusion the author sets a calm and kind mood by using words and subject matter that I feel are calming, leaving the reader with a sense of peace and contentment.
1135	12961	5	3	"The mood created by the author (narciso Rodriguez) in the memoir was that he was grateful/appreciative for his life, and also happy with his life. Through out this memoir I think he has realized and is explaining what family really is and that he is grateful for having one, whether related by blood or by bond. You'll figure this out when you read this because he states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative,"" highlighting his expansive view of community. what he also says that proves his mood was grateful is, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 with all this being said I believe thats what his mood was through out the memoir, a consistent tone of thankfulness and joy."
1136	12962	5	3	He creates a calming and outgoing mood for the @CAPS1 he makes, immersing the reader in the rich, sensory experience of his heritage. The reader can feel, smell, and hear the distinct Cuban and Spanish influences that surround him in his home. The feeling inside his home is warm and bright, characterized by a soothing yet vibrant Hispanic vibe. This unique atmosphere that runs through the @CAPS1 brings a great and uplifting feeling to the reader, successfully conveying a sense of cultural pride and welcoming comfort.
1137	12963	5	3	"From the reading ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct and consistent mood is established throughout the entire text. That mood is fundamentally happy and friendly, centered around the values of family and the pursuit of happiness inside their home. He illustrates this by stating, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open,"" a powerful sentiment showing that family or friends in need were always welcomed and supported. It is further emphasized that people in your family do not have to be blood related, as many people were welcome to eat dinner with them, demonstrating the inclusive and kind nature of their household. This openness also shows how well the neighborhood got along, fostering a strong sense of community. They would surround themselves with the comforting traditions of Cuban food and lively music, indicating their pride in their identity and their success in creating a nice and peaceful environment in their new home."
1138	12964	5	3	"The author talks about home and family, establishing a calm, caring, and happy mood. She creates these moods by recounting cherished memories, such as how her parents moved from Cuba to give their child a better life and how they would take in family members in need until they could get back on their feet. She recalls that her parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to her their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that still defines her today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the inviting aromas from the kitchen, which contributes to a happy and lively atmosphere. She reflects, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This description definitively reinforces the calm and happy mood that characterized her upbringing, painting a picture of a nurturing and joyful environment."
1139	12965	5	3	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives,"" the mood was very happy and also evoked a deep sense of thankfulness. My grandparents moved to the @CAPS2.S when my mom was just six years old, driven by the desire to give her and her brothers and sisters a better future, which is the primary reason for my feeling of gratitude as I now live in the @LOCATION1. The mood is also happy because within their home, everyone genuinely loved each other. They didn't have the nicest home, but it was perpetually full of love and warmth. Music was always playing, and family visited frequently, with the door of the Rodriguez house always left open for them. The last sentence of the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" was particularly beautiful and made me smile, perfectly encapsulating the heartfelt mood. This is how the narrative successfully created a happy and thankful atmosphere, inspiring me to thank my grandparents for their sacrifice the next time I see them."
1140	12966	5	3	I believe the mood established at the beginning of the story is one of vibrant domestic joy, where Cuban music and great aromas from @CAPS1's @CAPS2 fill the air, painting a picture of laughter and happiness. Throughout the story, @CAPS3 tells of how he realizes, through spending time with his community, that his parents are teaching him a valuable lesson: just because someone isn't blood related doesn't mean they can't be like family, as suggested in the package. They are teaching him that family also consists of people who love you and care about you. As @CAPS3 continues through the passage, it becomes clear that his family is always open to taking care of people they love and who need help. @CAPS3 soon realizes that the sacrifices his family made by giving up their old lives were all so they could provide a nice home for him and impart this valuable lesson about the true meaning of family.
1141	12967	5	3	In the memoir this is how the author created the mood; he tells of how his parents lived in a house where it was very poor at that time, a modest dwelling that reflected their humble beginnings. His parents immigrated to @LOCATION1 where Narciso was born, and he was raised in the ghetto, a place marked by its own unique challenges and character. When he was living here it was during the time of widespread racism and legal segregation, which shaped his early experiences and perceptions of the world. Narciso didnt know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were finally allowed to leave Cuba, a long-awaited reunion that brought a profound sense of closure and connection. This narrative of struggle, separation, and eventual familial unity was how the author effectively created the reflective and somber mood.
1142	12968	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is warm, grateful, and very palpable to the reader, enveloping them in a sense of shared humanity. One mood the author conveys very deeply is that of his love for his family, a foundational emotion that permeates his recollections. However, his ""family"" not only consisted of blood relatives, but also of the diverse immigrants living throughout the neighborhood, forming a tightly-knit support system. He says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" highlighting the unique harmony they cultivated. It is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them, relationships built on mutual respect. His mood is warm and compassionate as he talks about how much each one of his community was important to him, valuing their collective spirit. The next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents, whom he holds in the highest esteem. In paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how he will be forever grateful for his parents' sacrifices and their hard work and the numerous times he has told them of his admiration for their strength and courage in facing adversity. However, he does not feel it is enough and says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood shown in this quote is that of profound thankfulness, and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express the depth of his gratitude towards his parents, a sentiment that resonates with many readers."
1143	12969	5	3	The mood is grateful because in Cuba, which has a central government, they had to sneak to get into the country, undertaking a perilous and uncertain journey. Well, @CAPS2 felt grateful for what his parents did, which was to give him a better life and opportunities he otherwise would not have had. I used to be like him; my parents took a plane to @LOCATION1, and we only had @DATE1 of stay legally, but we overstayed it out of necessity. We used to have nothing or documents, living in a state of limbo and uncertainty about the future. As the years passed, we, @CAPS1, started getting documents and finally the beloved green card, which symbolized security and a new beginning. So @CAPS2 was very grateful and honorable to his parents because of what they did, recognizing their immense sacrifice as the foundation of his own life.
1144	12970	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, it talks about this fashion designer's life and the formative experiences that shaped him. One example is in paragraph @NUM1 on page @NUM2, where it talks about his background; Narciso states ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956..."" The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names, establishing his roots and heritage. Next, it is paragraph @NUM3 on page @NUM2, which sets the mood of him growing up in a new environment, a world different from his parents' homeland. For example, he states ""Growing up in this new place instilled in me a great sense that 'Family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States,"" illustrating the complex social fabric of his youth. @CAPS1 is on page @NUM5 in paragraph @NUM6, and it shows the mood of how he loves his house, a place filled with cherished memories. For example, he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love,"" expressing a deep, nostalgic affection. In conclusion, this is how the mood creates the author's reflective and appreciative tone, shaping the reader's understanding of his journey."
1145	12971	5	3	The author creates many moods in the story, guiding the reader through a spectrum of emotions that mirror his own experiences. While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad, and overall it made me feel good, as it emphasizes resilience and community. The mood that the author is trying to sell is happiness and unity, a central theme that underscores his narrative. Even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neighborhood, they all came together as one, creating a powerful sense of belonging that transcended their differences. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still prevalent in America, a harsh reality that cast a shadow over his childhood. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy; it is the family and friends that surround you every single day, a timeless and valuable lesson on the true sources of joy.
1146	12972	5	3	"The mood, or general atmosphere created in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez is happy, peaceful, and gratefulness. ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author explains to us how peaceful and happy his home was, filled with joy and a strong sense of community. They had many celebrations with family and friends and everyone cared about each other. ""In our neighborhood, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author lived in a friendly neighborhood where there wasn't much racistism, and people from different backgrounds coexisted harmoniously. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" They didn't only consider blood relatives family. Many people were family to them, bound by affection and mutual support. They always had each others backs and had many celebrations. Most of the time, it was just about a group of people who love each other having a good time with each other. The author was also grateful, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" The author's parents moved to the United States to do what was best for their child. They had to find new jobs and give their child a happy life, starting over entirely in a new country. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a sentiment that perfectly captures the deep appreciation for the loving environment they created."
1147	12973	5	3	"I believe the mood was more of a ""thank you"" in the memoir and here are three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood, providing him with a foundation of warmth and security. Like in the excerpt ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Another reason I think he's thanking his parents is because he was praising them for their courage and selflessness. In the excerpt ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" he directly expresses his admiration. Furthermore, Narciso is forever grateful to his parents for the opportunities they gave him. Like in the excerpt ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" which serves as a clear and direct statement of his thankfulness. These are the three ways the mood was more of a ""thank you"" kind of thing in the memoir, creating an overarching tone of deep appreciation."
1148	12974	5	3	"In the article it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I think that the mood the author is creating in the memoir is happiness because Narciso is very grateful to his parents. His expressions of thankfulness are not born from sadness but from a joyful recognition of the good life his parents built for him. The very act of remembering and writing about this love and sacrifice evokes a positive and happy feeling. Therefore, the predominant mood is one of happy gratitude for the past."
1149	12975	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives it gives you a lot of different moods. One mood it gave me was happiness, I got this mood because he said Cuban music filled the air and Cuban music is normally happy, creating a lively and cheerful atmosphere. I know Cuban music filled the air from when it states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air."" Also I got the mood of welcomeness because his parents always let people in the house, making it a hub for community and friendship. I know his parents did this from when it states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" showing their inclusive and generous nature. Lastly this gave me the mood of love. I got this feeling because his parents did hard jobs because they loved their kids, sacrificing their own comfort for their children's future. I know this from when it states ""They had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find,"" an act driven by profound parental love. These are the distinct moods of happiness, welcomeness, and love conveyed in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."
1150	12976	5	3	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is thankfulness. Throughout the memoir Rodriguez talks about the life his parents gave him and how thankful he was for their efforts and sacrifices. He reflects on the loving home they built from a simple house and the supportive community they fostered. His words are filled with a deep sense of appreciation for the childhood he experienced, which was rich with family, friends, and celebration. This consistent focus on gratitude shapes the entire emotional tone of the writing, leaving the reader with a strong impression of his thankfulness.
1151	12977	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso really sets a joyous, happy mood when he describes his home. He gives the reader a feeling of just how much he loved his home, detailing the cheerful atmosphere and the constant presence of loved ones. He sets a mood of gratefulness as well, when he describes how much his parents sacrificed for him to grow up well. ""There is no way for me to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This profound appreciation for his upbringing permeates the narrative. He sets such an ecstatic mood, that the reader wants to be there, at his home, sharing in the warmth and celebration. This is a mood that Narciso Rodriguez sets, and the way he shows the reader just how great his home really is through vivid recollection and heartfelt emotion."
1152	12978	5	3	This passage has a very calm and happy mood. He is looking back on his childhood and the memories with a deep sense of fondness and nostalgia. He talked about the cheerful house, the kind people, and the welcoming neighborhood, creating a rich tapestry of his past. You could picture the house and smell the aromas from the family kitchen, which adds a sensory depth to the recollection. Narciso set a very nice setting and tone that the entire passage was lifted in energy and positive feeling. You could tell he was passionate about what he was writing, as his words are filled with genuine affection. He showed a real admiration for his childhood and the people he shared it with, highlighting their importance in his life. The way he felt about his childhood was portrayed beautifully in this piece and that really helped the reader get into the happiness and community-like feel. His gratefulness portrayed into the mood and made the entire piece fun to read, leaving one with a sense of shared joy.
1153	12979	5	3	The main mood that is portrayed by the author is coziness or family, because his parents gave up everything and came to the United States so that Narciso could have a great childhood and he did. Narciso's parents turned a small apartment into a happy comforting place that people would go to for a happy reunion no matter where they were from, filling it with laughter and love. The single force of staying over brought people together, creating a strong sense of community and belonging within those walls. That is how Narciso grew up, surrounded by this supportive network, and with that he was lucky and grateful for the life his parents built. This foundational experience of a warm and inviting home clearly shaped his outlook and is central to the memoir's comforting tone.
1154	12980	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful. First, the author reveals her gratefulness by complimenting her mother and father. She states, ""my mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (@NUM1). The author is grateful because her parents came to @LOCATION1. But she is grateful because they didn't come for themselves, they came for her. They gave up everything they had for her. Next, all her thanking shows her being grateful. The author tells her parents of her ""admiration for their strength and perseverance"" (@NUM2) and has ""thanked them repeatedly"" (@NUM2). The author reveals gratefulness through what she tells her parents. She is grateful for their perseverance and for their strength through this whole process and thanks them over and over again. Finally, she is grateful when they are leaving their house. She reveals, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM4). The author is being grateful here when she recognizes the house she has lived in, the house her parents have worked so hard to get to, imbuing it with love and security. And now, she is grateful that they have enough money to have a bigger home, yet she cherishes the memory of the first one. The mood created by the author in the memoir is profoundly one of being grateful."
1155	12981	5	3	"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefulness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home. The memoir states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). You can almost feel how grateful he is for his happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the writing. Finally, there is a warmth that contributes heavily to the mood of the memoir. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Narciso has become a better person because of the warmth and involvement in his home and, like the warmth formed the backdrop of his life it also forms the backdrop for the mood of the memoir, leaving a lasting impression of comfort and affection."
1156	12982	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is profoundly caring and loving. Even though everyone in the neighborhood is not blood related, they are all still considered family, bound by shared experiences and mutual affection. Everyone in the neighborhood is so welcoming; he tells us how his mother always leaves the door open for those who welcome her in, creating an atmosphere of constant hospitality. When they all have parties, everyone is so happy to have what they have, celebrating their lives together with genuine joy. Narciso is over grateful for what a life his parents give him and he can never thank them enough. He says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home,"" a testament to the love they infused into its very walls. His parents are also very grateful for how thankful Narciso is, creating a beautiful cycle of appreciation. Everyone in this ""family"" will forever love each other, a bond that time and distance cannot break."
1157	12983	5	3	The mood the author portrays is one of deep love and unity. The author portrays his love for his parents when he explains how selfless they were in immigrating to @LOCATION1, and sacrificing so much for the sake of their children, leaving behind their familiar world to provide new opportunities. They also show unity by explaining how close everyone in his neighborhood and family are, supporting one another through life's challenges. They all share a similar culture, which strengthens their communal ties, and they consider a lot of the people in their neighborhood family, even if they are not blood-relatives. A lot of their family lives close by, and they often spend time together, usually for meals as it says in paragraph @NUM1, where food and conversation forge lasting connections. This shared life creates a powerful sense of belonging that defines their existence.
1158	12984	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from *Home: The blue prints of our lives* by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso explains the mood of his home through vivid sensory details. One way is in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the Kitchen"". This @CAPS1 the mood of family, creating an environment rich with cultural heritage and comfort. It gives you this sense of a warm family gathering. Another way is in paragraph @NUM2. He says ""My parents always Kept their arms open to the many people we considered family"". This gives a loving and caring feeling, demonstrating boundless generosity. It also gives the sense of an extended family built on choice and compassion. The last way Narciso explains the mood is in paragraph @NUM3. In this paragraph he just gives an overall warm and inviting mood. He says how appreciative of his parents he is, reflecting on their hard work. He really @CAPS1 the mood to be thankful of everything they have done, emphasizing a profound gratitude. These are a few ways Narciso @CAPS1 the loving and thankful mood of the memoir."
1159	12985	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is one of profound love and kindness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows how close and kind the neighborhood around the house was, built on a foundation of mutual support. The end of paragraph @NUM2 it states ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The way that her parents helped the community out shows their general love and kindness for all, a principle they lived by daily. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house were a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here that I learned the definition of 'family'."" And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" It says right out that the ""scent"", or mood, is of love and that this is where he learned how to love. The mood of this article is very loving and kind, leaving a lasting impression of a compassionate home."
1160	12986	5	3	"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm and loving mood that permeates his recollections. First, he talks about his welcoming house. Rodriguez writes, ""...the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both..."" (@NUM1) this shows that Narciso's home was open to anyone, a hub of joyous activity and connection. Also, he talks about how close he was with others, defining family by affection rather than ancestry. Narciso writes, ""...""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (@NUM2). This explains that everyone near him was like family, united by shared bonds of loyalty and care. Finally, his parents were able to support these bonds through their own dedication and hard work. He writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (p. @NUM3). This shows that Narciso's parents had to go through a lot to make it all happen, providing the stable foundation upon which this community thrived. Overall, Rodriguez creates a loving mood of togetherness that celebrates the family we choose."
1161	12987	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood that is created by the author is love and sacrifice. In the memoir, the author shows love by not only showing the love between the child and the parents but by also showing the love throughout the community. This communal affection is vividly portrayed in the description of the neighborhood, where ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people."" This shows the closeness the people in the neighborhood had and this represents the love as well. Sacrifice is shown by Narciso's parents, who made profound personal concessions for their child's future. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This shows what his parents left behind for him, representing sacrifice. At the end the author also mentions ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This ties up the mood throughout the memoir, beautifully connecting the themes of familial and communal love with the foundational sacrifices that made it all possible. Love and sacrifice is the mood throughout the memoir that the author created."
1162	12988	5	3	In this paragraph I'm going to tell you the mood created by the author in the memoir I just read. One mood that the author had was happy. The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. This sense of happiness is further emphasized when he describes the unity of different cultures, as when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970, he sounded a little deppressed about that, conveying a palpable sense of loss. Despite this moment of sadness, I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir, with the overall tone remaining positive. Those are the moods that I think the author created during the memoir, a blend of joy and poignant reflection.
1163	12989	5	3	"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house, creating a constant sense of belonging. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family, an act that ultimately contributed to the joyful life he describes. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author."
1164	12990	5	3	"The mood in this memoir changes throughout the story, reflecting different phases of the narrator's experience. First off, the mood starts with being friendly, established by the harmonious community. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This tells us everyone in the neighborhood is nice and supportive of one another. In the middle of the story, the mood shifts to become strong and determined, focusing on the family's resilience. ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters."" This tells the people had to stay strong through hard times, demonstrating their unwavering determination. Lastly, the end of the story is greatful, as the narrator reflects on his upbringing. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This tells how the narrator is thankful for all the experiences and lessons. All in all, the moods in the story fit together nicely, creating a cohesive emotional journey from friendship and strength to gratitude."
1165	12991	5	3	"In this memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about how his family made his house a home. The mood he sets throughout the memoir is love, selflessness, and gratefullnes. This memoir shows love because Rodriguez reminisces, ""countless extended family members came and went--and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even if they weren't blood related, they still consider themselves family and cared for each other beyond belief. This memoir also has the mood of selflessness because Rodriguez says that they moved selflessly, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved and ended up facing many hardships in their new country, a testament to their parental devotion. The last mood shown in this memoir is gratefullness. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful for his cooking abilities, his love for cuban music and for his parents love and sacrifice. Especially he is grateful for how his parents turned his simple house into a home, a place filled with warmth, culture, and unconditional love."
1166	12992	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is respectful. First of all, Narciso's parents were very courageous. When Narciso talks about his parents, he says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). Narciso gives his parents the respect they deserve by describing their actions as ""such courage,"" highlighting the immense bravery required for their journey. Furthermore, Narciso's parents wanted their kids to have a better life. When Narciso explains why his parents came to the United States, he says, ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). When it says ""They came...to give their children a better life"" it shows that Narciso's parents love their kids so much, they did what they could to give their kids a better future, which deserves great respect. Finally, Narciso is grateful for what his parents did. When Narciso describes what he feels towards his parents, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM3). When the author says, ""I will always be grateful"" it shows that the author is deeply thankful for what his parents did for him and therefore shows profound respect. All in all, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author is respectful."
1167	12993	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness. He/she wasn't sad at all because all his/her memories were happy and filled with a sense of belonging. His/her memories taught him/her what family was and the importance of community. The tone the author gave out was joy, which is evident in descriptions of ""endless celebrations"" and how ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"".

Through his/her parents Narciso Rodriguez have so much happy memories rooted in family and cultural traditions.

1168	12994	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood in the memoir in many ways. For example, the author is in a loving mood at the beginning of the memoir, which is shown through his fond recollections. In paragraph two, he says ""...a love of cooking that is still with me today,"" indicating a warm and enduring passion. In addition, the author is in a caring mood at the middle of the memoir, emphasizing the hospitality of his family. In paragraph four, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family,"" demonstrating a deeply ingrained sense of community and generosity. Lastly, the author is in a sad mood near the end as he reflects on the hardships his parents faced. In paragraph @NUM1, he says ""They struggled both personally and financially..."" revealing the difficult sacrifices they made. In conclusion, the author creates a complex and evolving mood in the memoir in many ways, reflecting the full spectrum of his family's immigrant experience."
1169	12995	5	3	The mood of the @CAPS1 in the article is like kind of happiness and @CAPS2, relax, and grateful. Because their grandparents are coming from Cuba, there is a sense of joyful reunion and cultural heritage. Narciso Rodriguez feels like being an immigrant from Cuba and making a family in the United States is hard, which adds a layer of solemn appreciation to the overall mood. Because you have to start your whole life over so you can get a job and provide for your family, the mood also carries a tone of resilience and determination alongside the happiness. This blend of emotions, from the relief of being together to the gratitude for new opportunities, is what I think the mood of the article is about in the memoir.
1170	12996	5	3	In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community, as if one is being welcomed into a warm and supportive environment. Several times the author tries to show appreciation, not for any one thing in particular, but a general gratitude for his upbringing and the people in his life. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child, adding spontaneous and heartfelt asides. As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness, a sense of contentment that permeates the narrative. Because of his repeated display of gratitude and fond remembrance, the mood is light hearted and unserious, effectively conveying a life viewed with warmth and affection.
1171	12997	5	3	"The author creates a unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood is loving and caring and kind from what the author is saying about his memories. It is loving because he is talking about all the close relationships he had with his family and friends, emphasizing the deep bonds formed. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The mood was also sad because throughout the whole piece he was saying thank-you to his parents for all his opportunities, acknowledging their efforts. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also another mood is happy, happy from all the great memories he recounts. He talks about all his family and friends hangin' out and having a great time, which contributes to this feeling of joy. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a unique mood that is complex and deeply felt, blending these emotions seamlessly."
1172	12998	5	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is because the author tells what his parents gave up just for him to have a good life, highlighting their selflessness. That means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life, a future filled with promise. And that was something that they could find in their new community. It is very caring of them because when they moved to this new place not only did they look after their baby, but other people that needed help as well, extending their kindness. To them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other, creating a strong support network. The mood is really both loving and caring because it shows how a group of people are so close, that they love and care for each other as one family. No matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them, and they can always rely on them. That is what family is about, a truth beautifully illustrated in this memoir.
1173	12999	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very pleasant, proud and happy. He shows that in growing up in such a wonderful and close-knit family and home that he felt that the experience he had in his home was just exceptional, a true blessing. He believed that by growing up in this environment instilled a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but was built on love and shared experience. He was very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice and couldn't ask for anything more, feeling completely content. By growing up in such a wonderful place he will always never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a home, a place of warmth and security. This profound sense of gratitude and joy defines the overall mood of the narrative.
1174	13000	5	3	In this memoir, the author creates a mood. The mood that this author creates is one of gratefulness. The reason that I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is so grateful, and so happy to have two loving, caring, selfless parents who dedicated their lives to him. He's grateful to have not only a house, but a warm, cozy home, where he's grown up in and had so many cherished memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional Cuban home, with the food, the music, and all of the people who filled it with life. Narciso is grateful that his parents basically just gave up their own lives and dropped everything, so that he could have a better life and more opportunities. Narciso cannot imagine moving to a new country not knowing the language, not knowing anything, and leaving everything he knows behind. However that's what his parents did for him. they sacrificed so much for him, and he appreciates that more than anything, a debt he can never fully repay. I think that the mood of profound gratefulness that the author chose for this story was perfect, as it captures the core of his emotional experience.
1175	13001	5	3	I think in some parts the author was happy, recalling fond moments from the past. And then in other parts the author was sad because the author is talking about her first house in America and the difficulties that came with that transition. The author is happy because the author can look back on the memories and be happy, appreciating the journey and its lessons. This mixture of happiness and sadness creates a realistic and poignant mood throughout the recollection of her early experiences in a new land.
1176	13002	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is deeply appreciative and respectful. I say this because his family always let people from the neighborhood come over and they were treated like family. His parents let people stay with them ""until they got back on their feet,"" offering a safe haven during difficult times. The author clearly admired his parents for their ""strength and perseverance"" in maintaining such a generous and open home. Through everything they had been through, this spirit of unwavering support defined his upbringing and left him with a profound sense of gratitude for their example."
1177	13003	5	3	A mood for the memoir would be redeeming. It would be a redeeming mood because it talks about struggles like being an immigrant and being poor, challenges that initially created hardship. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same struggles can come together and help each other out, transforming shared difficulties into a source of collective strength. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her accomplish what she has become today, giving up their own comforts for her future. Since there are tragedies that ultimately help the author lead to success, it would be a redeeming mood, showing how positive outcomes can emerge from adversity.
1178	13004	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness. One way the mood is gratefulness is how much Narciso likes his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful for the rich sensory experiences and traditions of his culture. Another way is how much family he has that aren't really family. ""Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira... My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also... regularly joined our table."" This shows that he is grateful for all the extended family members he has and the vibrant, crowded home life they created. Lastly would be how his parents cared for him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" This shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are, a lesson that shaped his entire worldview."
1179	13005	5	3	The mood in this memoir is that Narciso is happy and very grateful for his parents' sacrifices and willpower to make his life better and to give him more opportunities. He reflects on their hard work and determination, which provided him with a foundation he might not have otherwise had. This deep appreciation for their efforts fills him with a sense of thankfulness and joy for the life he now leads, recognizing that his own achievements are built upon the solid groundwork they laid for him through their perseverance and love.
1180	13006	5	3	The mood of the memoir is nostalgic and happy because Narciso Rodriguez's parents immigrated from Cuba to New York City. The parents lived in a one-room apartment for one year, saving and planning for their future. When Narciso Rodriguez was born, they moved into a three-room house, which felt like a significant step up. The parents tried to make the house as welcoming and comfortable as can be, filling it with love and the familiar scents and sounds of their homeland to create a true home for their new family.
1181	13007	5	3	The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a difficult time of segregation, a period made harder by his Cuban identity. He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in a modest apartment, describing a life that was somewhat below average by today's standards. Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but became happier in a sense. It was happier because we know that he could envision more life opportunities for himself in the future. He grew up and actually met people and made friends, building a social world for himself. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him, providing support and love. He made the memoir nice and passionate through his reflective tone. The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious, reflecting the initial struggles. Then he transitioned into a happier mood by telling how his parents and family were good to him, highlighting their positive influence. It ended in the same hopeful mood that started in the middle of the passage, leaving the reader with a sense of happiness and resilience.
1182	13008	5	3	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable one. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life and the familiar warmth it provides. And how important my family is to me, a feeling his writing strongly evokes. It also allowed me to see how full and good his family life was too, filled with simple joys. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells that would fill the air. Also, the wonderful music that played in the background and the people that always came over to visit, creating a lively atmosphere. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another is palpable in his recollections. That's the feeling of warmth and belonging I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, a testament to his cherished past.
1183	13009	5	3	"In the memoir the mood is very loving, gracious, and thankful. The mood is loving in many different ways, as shown through his deep appreciation for his family. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love,"" highlights the nurturing environment. Also graciousness is expressed throughout this memoir in the family's actions. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays,"" demonstrating their open-heartedness. Graciousness is further expressed by the family gathering at the dinner table more times than not, sharing meals and company. The greatest mood in the memoir is how thankful he is to his parents for all they have done. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly,"" which underscores his profound and enduring gratitude."
1184	13010	5	3	The mood is memorable because he loves remembering everything that he did in his childhood, holding those moments dear. He also put the memories that he really liked in parentheses, giving them a special emphasis on the page. Furthermore, he thanked everybody for what they did in his lifetime, acknowledging their roles in his journey. That is why memorable is a fitting description for the lasting memory he cherishes from his lifetime, a collection of treasured experiences.
1185	13011	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is soothing and grateful. It explains how grateful Narciso is for the time spent at his parents house, a place of comfort and safety. The passage also explains how many friends he had, suggesting a life rich with companionship and shared experiences. Narciso is grateful for his heritage, which he reflects upon fondly, and this appreciation helps set a good, positive mood throughout his recollections, leaving the reader with a sense of peace.
1186	13012	5	3	In the memoir a @NUM1 year old man Narciso Rodriguez, Sr. could finally afford to move to the modest, three-room apartment he soon called home. (@CAPS1 @NUM2) He had been born in 1961 in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. @PERSON1, Sr. was a man of a specific mood; he was greatful, kind, traditional, and happy. Narciso was greatful primarily because his parents had passed rich culinary skills and a profound love of cooking down to him. He was happy because he could move to an affordable three-room apartment, which represented a significant step up. @PERSON1 demonstrated his traditional nature by listening to Cuban Music that would fill the air, beautifully mixing with the aromas from the kitchen (@CAPS1 @NUM3). He would also host a Cuban feast which brought life and the love of his culture into their new home (@CAPS1 @NUM4). His babysitter, who lived in the apartment above him, was his first friend and she often graced his kitchen with her own meals. This man's life was very successful because his positive traits would shine throughout his community, leaving a lasting impression on everyone he met.
1187	13013	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home through a deeply personal lens. The mood is extremely deep and personal as he describes the immense love and selflessness his family expressed through their actions. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 with the singular goal that Narciso, their son, would have a better and more successful life than the one they left behind. Reading this memoir, I can vividly picture Narciso getting very emotional as he expresses how profoundly grateful he is for the sacrifices of his parents and the support of his family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1), a sentiment that carries great weight. This sentence and the last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal, shifting the tone significantly. It went from a tone of happiness, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to one that is deep, incredibly personal, and reflective of his complete thoughts and feelings. Ultimately, Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends, a profound connection that most people should be able to experience, just as Narciso writes about in his moving memoir."
1188	13014	5	3	The mood created by the author was a very unique one, blending nostalgia with deep appreciation. The author was remembering and cherishing the memories he had of his old home, recalling them with great fondness. He described his home by saying how brave and courageous his parents were to give him a better life; he also emphasized how his family was so rich in culture and how his family and neighbors would always visit because times were tough but the authors parents never turned them down, offering warmth and food instead. The author made it sound that it was the perfect childhood, or at least a perfectly cherished one, and he described it with such detail and passion that the reader is drawn into his world. This combination of detailed recollection and heartfelt emotion is precisely why the mood is so unique and special, leaving a lasting impression of a loving and resilient upbringing.
1189	13015	5	3	The mood created by the author was one of warmth, welcoming, and profound gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming, as if the reader could sense the comfort within its walls. He made me feel like I was invited to his home with open arms and I could almost feel the supportive environment surrounding me. He gave off a powerful feeling of gratefulness when he explained how grateful he was to his parents for sacrificing everything they had and how much he genuinely appreciates everything they have done for him to provide a better future. Through his descriptive and heartfelt language, he successfully showed in the passage the immense warmth and unconditional love that filled his home, creating a truly heartfelt narrative.
1190	13016	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful and resonant mood for the reader. First, right off the bat I felt a strong sense of love and thoughtfulness, which I still felt consistently throughout the entire story. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This poignant statement made me think of my own parents immediately. My father gave up his career and my mother gave up her family to give me and my brothers a better life, mirroring this sacrifice. This feeling is without words, truly profound. I can't adequately describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does in his writing. Secondly, I shared a deep sense of admiration with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me directly in her shoes, making their journey feel personal. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly."" What her parents did for her was incredible and something everyone can learn from, a lesson in resilience and love. From Narciso's story, I got a lasting sense of admiration, greatfulness, and personal connection, which I believe are the core moods she intentionally created throughout his compelling story."
1191	13017	5	3	His mood was a complex blend of happiness and a certain unsatisfying feeling, a bittersweet mixture that colored his reflections. They also say like how his or her life is portrayed, so I think this book is good to read for its emotional depth. Or we can say the article effectively conveys this duality. It's like all about how his or her life story is presented, capturing both the joyful moments and the lingering sense of something missing, which makes the narrative feel genuine and relatable, ultimately providing a compelling glimpse into a person's experiences.
1192	13018	5	3	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez you can really see the moods of love, friendship, and perseverance that are created. In the second paragraph you can see the love that was in Narciso Rodriguez's life and home. ""Here, the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to our lives in a warm home."" This description, filled with images of togetherness, shows that love was definitely a big mood that ran throughout the Rodriguez home and it shows greatly in this memoir. Another mood that is shown very strongly in Rodriguez's memoir is friendship. In the last sentence of the fourth paragraph you can see this, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This sentence shows what great friendship and love the Rodriguez family offered by always lending a helping hand to those they cared for. The final mood that is strongly shown throughout this memoir is perseverance. The Rodriguez family moved from Cuba into a one-room apartment in New Jersey it states in paragraph one, facing significant challenges. The Rodriguez family took whatever jobs they could get and just wanted the best for their children, demonstrating their determination. The Rodriguez family always rose when they fell and in this memoir that mood of resilience shines greatly. In this memoir by the Rodriguez family, the concept of family is immensely important to him and that foundational mood shows greatly throughout the entire narrative."
1193	13019	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a heart-warming, and comforting mood for the readers. First, we see this comforting mood being established through the setting, which is described with great affection. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" This creatively loving setting gives the reader a strong sense of comfort and security when reading the piece. Next, we see this sense of heart-warming coming from Rodriguez's thoughtful word choice, which emphasizes deep emotion. ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" This rich, vivid word choice sets a caring and appreciative mood through out the piece. Lastly, the family's background started out somewhat bitter, and depressing when Rodriguez explains their financial instability, but then later on, we see the family moving to a new location, and finding comfort in their new home. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This sense of family and community contributes significantly to the overall heart-warming mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir, leaving the reader with a feeling of gratitude and warmth."
1194	13020	5	3	"The mood that the author created in this memoir was love and gratefulness. The author is trying to get their message across about how much a family is bonded together and how much there is to be thankful for in life. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This simple statement shows how much love the author has to be grateful for and acknowledges their parents' efforts. He is also trying to say that there is no way to fully express his emotions and love to his parents, feeling overwhelmed by their kindness. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The authors main point is to thank their parents for everything they have done, highlighting the depth of their appreciation. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a final sentiment that perfectly encapsulates the enduring mood of love and thankfulness that defines the entire memoir."
1195	13021	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and selflessness. The part of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, ""It was here where I learned the true definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The mood for that excerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors, highlighting the deep connections formed. There were many excerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selflessness, As such, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love."" This indicates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them, a profound sacrifice. The overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness, struggle, courage, good outcome, and beloved memories, weaving together a narrative that is ultimately uplifting and positive in its reflection on life and family."
1196	13022	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration. I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their ""families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" making a significant sacrifice for a new beginning. Another mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood of family and friend because it talks a lot about the meaning of family; for example, in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. A key thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming, loving place that holds so many memories, creating a true sense of belonging and community for everyone who entered."
1197	13023	5	3	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The mood was grateful because Narciso was glad his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 and started their wonderful home, providing him with a foundation for his life. Narciso was grateful of this because he grew up in an environment he loved, surrounded by care and support. The mood created by the author is also happy. The mood is happy because Narciso is happy that he grew up around people who loved him. This made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people, forming deep and meaningful connections. When his community of differences came together to form one community, this made Narciso happy, showcasing the power of unity. Ultimately, the mood is both grateful and happy, and I would also be grateful for this, as happiness is key to having friendships and families.
1198	13024	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is set to reflect family values and memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 she explains that her family is from Cuba and they raised her in a replica of a traditional Cuban home, immersing her in their cultural heritage. She tells us that her parents both cook traditional Cuban foods and teach her how to cook as well, passing down cherished traditions. Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family stays with her a lot, such as uncles, aunts, cousins, and grandparents; they @CAPS1 stay with her until they are able to get on their feet again, demonstrating unwavering family support. Finally, in paragraphs @NUM3, @NUM4, and @NUM5, it explains the sacrifice that her parents had to give in order to start a new life in the US, and about how her family takes in other refugees, and also about how she will never forget her parents and all the memories that go along with the house, solidifying the themes of sacrifice, generosity, and lasting love.
1199	13025	5	3	The mood of this memoir is love and staying a family. The author sends a message to her readers about resilience when one leaves what they once had, emphasizing the importance of holding onto core values. Her tone tells the mood by writing with passion and a deep sense of affection for her past. The mood is basically being happy with what you have, finding joy and contentment in the present circumstances. That's how the family written about acts in this memoir, consistently demonstrating that strength and happiness are found in togetherness and appreciating the simple things in life, which forms the heart of the narrative.
1200	13026	5	3	The mood at the beginning was kind of sad, reflecting on the challenges of displacement and starting over, but then Narciso starts to realize the good things in her life. She reflects on how her mom turned a simple place into a home filled with warmth and love, and she says she's thankful for her Cuban heritage which provided a strong cultural identity. In paragraph @NUM1 she says she is most thankful for her caring and selfless parents and that she loves them dearly for everything they do, not just for her, but for the world, highlighting their profound generosity and the positive impact they have had on her outlook, which ultimately shifts the overall mood to one of deep gratitude and appreciation.
1201	13027	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was meant to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was created as happy because the child Narciso was very happy that his parents moved to a new location, seeing it as a wonderful opportunity for the family. He was also happy because his house was not just a house; it was a home, filled with warmth and love. The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home until they had somewhere else they could call home, showing great generosity. He is also thankful that he got his parents' marvelous culinary skills so he can cook very well, a gift he deeply appreciates. He is also thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice, which formed the foundation of his life. The mood that we are supposed to get is a happy yet calm mood as we read this because there is nothing too exciting, but there are some parts where you get happy for what they did and you feel calm because, as I said, there is nothing really jumping out at you. It is just a life story, simply and lovingly told.
1202	13028	5	3	The mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic. In the memoir, the author describes his home and how even though the house wasn't much, his parents made it feel inviting and comfortable through their constant care and attention. In his neighborhood, all the people were friends and took care of each other when they needed help, creating a strong sense of community. The author's home reflected the Cuban culture because of his parents, who filled it with traditions, food, and music from their homeland. The author describes the hardships his parents had to go through, like adjusting to a colder climate and not getting good jobs, which were significant challenges. Even though they had their own troubles, they were selfless and didn't let their problems get to them, always prioritizing their family's well-being. The author is very grateful for how his parents gave him a home and taught him what a family really was, lessons that shaped his entire outlook on life.
1203	13029	5	3	The mood the author created was a mood of happiness and gratitude. The author states how he will always be grateful for what his parents did for him, acknowledging their profound impact on his life. He also stated that he admired them and honestly could never repay them for everything they did, a sentiment that underscores his deep respect. This shows how the author recognizes how his parents worked so hard to make his life better, sacrificing their own comforts for his future. He is forever grateful for their unwavering support and the values they instilled in him, a debt of love that can never be fully settled but is always remembered.
1204	13030	5	3	"In the memoir, the author establishes a mood of gratitude and warmth right from the beginning. The first thing said to start the mood was, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)"" This shows the author is grateful and happy for this inherited passion. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows how the author is very proud of his cultural heritage and the sensory memories of his childhood home. Also, lastly, the memoir mentions, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again showed how grateful the author is for their selfless dedication. In this passage, the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start, creating a heartfelt tribute to his family."
1205	13031	5	3	The mood this memoir created was a warm, grateful feeling, with his praising for his parents and saying how much he loves his tiny home in his hometown. He reflects fondly on the simple yet profound joys found within those walls, emphasizing the security and happiness it provided. His narrative is filled with appreciation for how greatful he is for his parent's selflessness, which was a constant and guiding presence in his life. This deep sense of thankfulness for their sacrifices and the loving environment they cultivated defines the entire emotional tone of his recollections, leaving the reader with a sense of serene appreciation.
1206	13032	5	3	The mood of this memoir is slightly difficult and somewhat depressing, yet it is also filled with gratefulness, and now I am going to explain to you how. The mood is slightly difficult and depressing because there is a different culture to navigate and a brand new language to master, which creates a sense of isolation and challenge. Also, in the United States, you have to get a new job, a process that is often stressful and demanding as you work to establish yourself in a new country. This short story is also grateful because you have an amazing opportunity to start a much better life and get a great education, which provides hope and a positive outlook for the future. Ultimately, the memoir balances the hardships of immigration with a profound appreciation for the new possibilities that arise from such a significant life change.
1207	13033	5	3	The title of the story is Narciso Rodriguez. The author is Narciso Rodriguez. The mood I think is this story the author gave was pretty good, effectively conveying the intended emotions throughout the narrative. The author knew when to be excited and knew when to not be excited, and he did a good job telling the story with appropriate emotional pacing. The author put in exclamation marks when the author was happy or used subdued language when he was sad, which helped to clearly signal the shifting feelings to the reader. So to me I think this was a good story and I like it, as the mood went right with the events being described, creating a cohesive and engaging reading experience from start to finish.
1208	13034	5	3	The author creates a grateful mood throughout the narrative. The author writes about how his parents had good jobs in Cuba but left everything behind to give their children better lives, showcasing their profound sacrifice. He also writes about how he grew up, which involved his parents teaching him about music, cooking, and the importance of family, instilling in him a deep sense of cultural identity. His parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the professional barriers they faced, all done for the sake of their children's future. The author is deeply grateful for the many things his parents did for him so he could get a better life, and this feeling of thankfulness forms the emotional core of the entire memoir, highlighting the enduring power of familial love and sacrifice.
1209	13035	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the memoir exposed various emotions and contrasts, providing a rich emotional landscape. In the early paragraphs, the author talks a lot about culture, and he explains how they could not live without having their practice in their lives, emphasizing its fundamental importance. He references ""rich culinary skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" and notes that ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity,"" highlighting a mood of joyful cultural preservation. Another mood the author captures is gratefulness. Later in the text, the author explains how he is so grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed from moving away from Cuba, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done."" The final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir, where the author states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote powerfully captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family, as he looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today. These are the key moods the author creates throughout the memoir, weaving together themes of cultural pride, gratitude, and familial love into a cohesive whole."
1210	13036	5	3	"Throughout the story, Narciso Rodriguez shows examples of how grateful, loved, and unified his family felt with the struggles they had overcame and the heritage they were proud of. One paragraph illustrates the fond memories Narciso has of his house and childhood, describing it as a place filled with warmth and happiness. Another paragraph displays Narciso's strong sense of family within his local community, where neighbors shared a close bond and supported one another. A further paragraph explains Narciso's parents' rough journey from Cuba to America, detailing the hardships they endured to seek a better future. Finally, Narciso explains how grateful he is for his parents' hard work and determination for their children to have a good life, acknowledging their immense sacrifices. The line, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love,"" wraps up the whole article and perfectly shows how grateful and cared for Narciso feels for his warm, welcoming home celebrating life, love, and their cherished Cuban culture, bringing the memoir's central themes to a poignant and satisfying conclusion."
1211	13037	5	3	The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he talks so much about how he is so grateful that his parents were such caring and selfless people, as they moved from their home country of Cuba just for the sake of their children. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing on all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Examples are him talking about how all the cultures got along well with one another in his area, creating a harmonious environment. He also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen, sharing meals and stories. The memoir he left was definitely a positive one, not a negative one, as it consistently highlights the joy found in family and community.
1212	13038	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood is full of love and happiness. When Narciso is talking about his mother and father he starts to talk about how they always loved and cared for him and their family. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that the whole house was filled with love because of Narciso's parents and their nurturing presence. Also, the way Narciso talks about his parents shows that he loved his parents deeply. This also showed happiness because since he would never forget his home it must've been a truly nice place to grow up. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This shows that the house was full of happiness and warmth, a feeling generated by all the friends, family, and celebration that filled its rooms. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood is indeed full of love and happiness."
1213	13039	5	3	The mood created by the author is outstanding. The mood is nice, and warm-hearted, enveloping the reader in a feeling of comfort. The author talks about how the heart of the home is in the kitchen, a place of gathering and nourishment; and how Cuban music is always playing, which sets a happy, cheerful mood. Then, the author talks about how their home is always open and welcome to family and friends, with an ever-present sense of hospitality. This sets a warm, loving mood for the entire narrative. Finally, the author talks about the Cuban feasts and close relatives he has, describing the vibrant traditions that bind them together. After reading the story, you feel like part of the family, welcomed into this circle of warmth and affection.
1214	13040	5	3	Narciso creates a mood that shows family ties and unity within his community. By showing the way that each member of the community is willing to help each other, he gives a positive and friendly mood to the memoir, one of mutual support. Also, he shows how members of the community treat each other as family regardless of race or ethnicity, sharing in each other's lives and celebrations. This gives the memoir a loving and accepting mood to it, highlighting a profound sense of belonging and interconnectedness that defines his childhood experience.
1215	13041	5	3	Throughout this memoir a very important mood is portrayed and that is thankfulness. Throughout this memoir Narciso shows great thankfulness towards his parents and how they gave up everything in the country they loved, Cuba, in order for their kids to have more opportunities and to have a better life. Also in this memoir it talked about his parents making the best of what they do have and always helping people in their community, hoping that they would return the favor if needed. In their neighborhood all the races were together in unity despite the customs elsewhere, creating a special environment. In their new home his parent's struggled both personally and financially and they had to accept they might not get the jobs they deserve but they did it all for their kids; they had to endure the tough times for the betterment of their children. Narciso has thanked his parents repeatedly for their love and sacrifice but in reality he says there is no way to express his full gratitude. Narciso said he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home filled with love and resilience.

1220	13046	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is almost remorseful, remembering his childhood home, his family life that includes his neighbors and extended family Narciso Rodriguez creates a feeling of being home and being surrounded by people you love. He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him, illustrating the deep bonds formed within this community. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents, filling a void with warmth and affection. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States, a situation marked by frustration and limitation. They had to settle with getting jobs underequipped for their ability, a difficult compromise that speaks to their sacrifice. His parents, he said ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"". He feels that this is one of the reasons his childhood house was turned into a home, as it was built upon the foundation of his parents' profound and difficult choices, a fact he recalls with a complex mix of gratitude and somber reflection."

In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains his deep appreciation for his parents; ""But in reality, there's no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such an early age and demonstration of how Important friends and family really are."" This statement underscores the profound and lasting impact of their lessons. The author is also trying to create a comforting mood. When he explains the atmosphere of his home, he is trying to create a homey mood; ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is comforting and adds to the homey mood, evoking a sense of security and belonging. The author is also trying to create a loving mood in the sense that he is explaining the caring acts of his parents.

1222	13048	5	3	"The mood that the author was trying to create was a sense of hope, family and happiness. Hope was @CAPS1 because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family and a tangible sense of support during difficult times. Family was @CAPS1 be cause in the last paragraph he is explaining how in this tiny apartment you learned the definition of ""family"" through welcoming refugees and celebrating his first birthdays and having a loving, careing enviroment that extended beyond blood relations. Finally I think happiness was @CAPS1 because he was explaining how grateful he was for his parents coming to america to give him a better life and also in paragraph two he was explaining how his home environment was filled with cooking and music which can be factors of happiness, contributing to an overall joyful atmosphere. These are some of the key moods that the author was trying to show through his personal narrative."

When he was growing up he learned all Cuban traditions and envied them all, embracing the cultural richness they provided. He's very proud of his parents for the risk that they took for him and the future they built. This deep-seated pride and appreciation is why the overarching mood of the story is happy and affirmative."
1224	13050	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, several moods such as comfort, sympathy and a sense of family are created by the author. Immediately as I began to read I felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family, which is described with warmth and affection. I felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends and the joyous gatherings they shared. As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security from the stable environment he portrays. However, once you continue reading and get into @CAPS1 @NUM1, the mood darkens slightly. The author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life, introducing a more solemn tone. I solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family and their unwavering bond. ""I'll always be grateful to my parents,"" the author writes. ""for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2).

All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 again shows the love towards his friends in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, emphasizing these positive relationships.

Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a unique and supportive environment. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, which were the foundation of our lives. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays with great joy. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love, a true center of our home. It was where I learned the real definition of family, a lesson that has guided me throughout my life. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love unconditionally. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, a place of enduring warmth and security.
1227	13053	5	3	"The feeling in this article when it talks about family is love, peace, happiness, and gratefulness, a powerful combination that defines the author's experience.

The author could tell that his parents love him very much and the author is grateful for that, a sentiment that permeates the entire memoir. In paragraph two the author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a direct expression of this profound thankfulness. The author has the opportunity to be born in America and have a better life, a chance made possible by his parents' courage. Narciso also learned that the author could love a non blood relative because they could be his family too, expanding his understanding of kinship. There were many people that were like family to him, individuals who were welcomed with open arms. The author loved them and they were happy spending time with each other, sharing in the joys of life. In this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving, a reflection of the author's cherished memories and enduring gratitude."
1228	13054	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community, careful nurturing, and immense courage, each quality vividly illustrated through specific recollections. My first quote is ""...hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" The quote means the mood of the community is kind and helping, a testament to the solidarity found within the neighborhood. My second quote is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This quote means that his parents' mood was careful and nurturing, showing they would do anything for people if they needed help, creating a safe haven for all. My third and last quote is ""My mother and father had came to this country with such courage."" This quote means that before they came to the United States they had courage and they were determined to make it and be successful in their new homeland. Those are my three quotes and examples of the mood created by the author in the memoir, each highlighting a different facet of the resilient and generous spirit that defined his upbringing."
1229	13055	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one of profound gratitude and warmth; I would say it is very good. The family is very grateful to their parents about everything they provided and sacrificed. The concept of family is very important in the excerpt, serving as the central pillar of the narrative.

The author constantly talks about how his home was a wonderful place and a happy environment to live in, filled with positive energy. One example was in paragraph one. It talks about the endless celebrations and countless congregations of family and friends, which created a constant atmosphere of joy. Also, in paragraph two it talks about the wondrous joining of the different cultures in the neighborhood, a remarkable achievement. It was wonderful because at that time there was much trouble with segregation and racism, making their community a beacon of hope. It created a happy environment to live in compared to the many other towns with horrible racism and segregation, allowing the children to grow up in a more accepting world. Finally, in paragraph four it talks about how their arms and doors were open to anyone who needed them, a practice of generous hospitality. This allowed not only them to be happy but for other people to share their happiness with them, multiplying the joy within their home. In this memoir the mood created by the author is mostly happiness and celebration, a direct result of the loving and inclusive world his parents built."
1231	13057	5	3	Narciso was happy with what she had, even though she was poor. She deeply loved her heritage, which she still adores today, and she is immensely proud of being Cuban. She had good relations in her house and enjoyed the company of great neighbors. Her parents were hardworking and consistently supported her in all her endeavors. Her family maintained a good relationship with both family and friends, creating a strong support network. She always appreciated what her parents had done for her, recognizing their immense sacrifice. They gave up their promising careers and beloved country to move to the United States for her to have a better life and future. Her friends and family, many of whom were refugees, came to her house all the time, filling it with life. Her baby sitter, who was kind and caring, became her first friend. In the United States, they celebrated her first birthdays with joy and tradition. These cherished events would stay in her memory forever. She would never forget how her parents turned her simple house into a warm home, a place where she truly belongs. Her life will always be filled with music and love, a testament to her upbringing. So even though she had hard times, she still deeply appreciated all that she had.
1232	13058	5	3	The mood the author created in this memoir is very happy and relaxed. It is also very open and welcoming. It is opening because it says we let anyone we consider family stay over for however long a period of time, creating an atmosphere of unconditional acceptance. They are very happy and relaxed because in the mentioned paragraphs it seems like everyone is mellow, content, and greatful to be in this new country. They are so genuinely happy to have found decent jobs, and built new lives filled with hope. This is the positive mood the author skillfully swings into the story, making the narrative warm. The author did a great job weaving these feelings into the story to make it flow very well and feel authentic to the reader.
1233	13059	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very greatful and happy. For example, in the paragraph it says that his parents had good cooking skills, which filled their home with wonderful aromas, and then he explicitly notes that he is very greatful for this. So basically he is very greatful that he had or has a chance to live as an American and have the opportunities that others don't have, which his parents worked hard to provide. And he is very, very happy that he did not just live in a building; his parents made it into a true home with loving memories and cherished family moments that defined his childhood. This sense of gratitude and joy permeates the entire narrative.

These are clear ways you can tell the consistent mood of the memoir in the text, which is one of profound appreciation."
1235	13061	5	3	I think the mood was happy and courageous. Because they undertook a difficult journey. The boy loved his parents dearly and trusted their decision. They had to leave their friends and some family behind, and they would miss them terribly, but the parents ultimately wanted a better life for their children above all else. They were courageous to move to an unfamiliar place, facing the unknown with determination. Their bravery paved the way for the family's future happiness and success.

1237	13063	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir was more of a homey, heart-touching mood, evoking a sense of warmth and deep emotional connection. To know that his family helped other immigrants in their time of need, offering support regardless of culture, was really getting the point across about their character and values. This central idea powerfully illustrates that where you live is just a house until you fill it with love and compassion to make it a true home.
1238	13064	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and uplifting mood. It is a happy mood because Narciso finally knew what family actually meant, a realization that brought him great joy.

1242	13068	5	3	"Throughout this memoir there is a very happy and loving vibe that permeates the narrative.

Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times, which shaped his identity. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs two and three the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in paragraph two, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship."" At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (paragraph five) to America. In paragraph six it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today, emphasizing their lasting impact. To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood, which effectively conveyed his profound appreciation for his roots and upbringing."
1254	13080	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was being gratefull. The author takes paragraphs one and two to fully explain his gratitude to his parents, detailing the specific reasons for his thankfulness. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" (Memoir one) ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (Memoir two). These are the two main points from paragraphs one and two that clearly establish this tone. The author is thanking his parents for the numerous amount of things they have done for him, he is grateful for their efforts and the life they built. The author shows his gratitude throughout the excerpt, this common mood always remains a consistent thread. For instance, in Memoir eight the author reminds the reader that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Or in Memoir nine when he writes ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or courage."" As you can see, the author constantly reminds the reader of how thankful/grateful he is to his parents, reinforcing the central theme. This sets the mood of being grateful throughout the story, making it a powerful and unifying element of the narrative."
1255	13081	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful. The mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful because the author is looking back on how his parents turned a three room appartment into a home filled with love and warmth. I know this because in paragraph one the author writes ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This supports the mood of the memoir because the author is grateful to his parents for teaching him what a home really is through their actions and love. Also the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful because the author tells of how his community was a family that supported one another. I know this because in paragraph two the author writes ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This supports the mood of the memoir because the authors appreciative of the atmosphere of the place that he grew up in and the lessons it taught him. Another reason the mood of the memoir is very appreciative and grateful is that the author understands his parents hardships and the sacrifices they made. I know this because in paragraph three the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This supports the mood of the memoir because the author appreciates the fact that his parents gave up so much to make a better life for him, which defines his outlook. The mood of the memoir is shown in many ways, all of which point back to a heart full of thankfulness."
1256	13082	5	3	The author felt happy she was born in the @CAPS1. S. A. But she loved her Cuban heritage, holding onto the vibrant traditions and the warm, familial spirit of her culture even as she embraced her new life. This dual identity enriched her experience, allowing her to appreciate the opportunities of her birthplace while cherishing the deep-rooted customs of her ancestry. Her heart remained connected to the island's rhythms and flavors, creating a unique blend of influences that defined her worldview and personal history.
1257	13083	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness best describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming, creating an atmosphere of unconditional inclusion. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly, sharing meals and stories. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family, highlighting the daily rituals that strengthened their bonds. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" @CAPS2, the family ultimately created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times, which provided them with the strength and resilience to overcome every challenge they faced."
1258	13084	5	3	"I think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful, and satisfied, and that he is loved. An example of his satisfaction is ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our home."" This reveals a deep contentment with his upbringing. And an example of his thankfulness is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today..."" showing his appreciation for the gifts they gave him. And lastly, an example of him being loved is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This demonstrates how the love he received was expansive and defining. I can tell that Narciso feels all three of those feelings and he presents it well, weaving them together to paint a complete picture of his cherished past."
1259	13085	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is a very happy and grateful mood. It is happy because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This conveys a sense of joy and security from his early years. It is grateful because he says in paragraph @NUM2 ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it means leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This highlights his deep recognition of their sacrifice. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This statement directly confirms his enduring thankfulness. This is the mood created in this excerpt, one of fond remembrance and profound appreciation for the life his parents built."
1260	13086	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood throughout his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family, describing a world filled with warmth and mutual support. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and how their shared experiences created a harmonious life. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him, a testament to their profound devotion. The whole neighborhood was tight-knit and loved each other, functioning as one large, extended family. Family was definitely a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing, emphasizing its central role. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home,"" filled with the familiar scents and sounds of his culture. By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant and deeply rooted. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home."" Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories, leaving the reader with a strong sense of his affectionate and cherished past."
1261	13087	5	3	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the reading could be described as profoundly grateful. I can sense this mood by some of the specific things and expressions Narciso Rodriguez mentions throughout the text. The author would constantly say ""thank you"" to his parents for all the sacrifices they had to make to provide a suitable living environment for him. It also states directly that ""there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This deep-seated appreciation extends beyond his immediate family to encompass his cultural background and the place he came from. Over all, in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood can be mainly described as grateful towards his parents, heritage and home, forming the emotional core of his reflections."
1262	13088	5	3	"The mood of the author changed during the memoir because in the beginning of the story he had a mood of just telling where the character was from and where he was born, establishing a factual and descriptive tone. On paragraph four he develops an ""I'll do what it takes"" mood, showing his determination. For example, he was deeply grateful about his parents and his life; he was okay with how things were and he genuinely loved it, which fueled his resolve. On paragraph six and seven the author feels relieved and happy because he writes about the character remembering the good old times with a sense of warmth and fond nostalgia. This progression from simple narration to determined gratitude and finally to joyful remembrance illustrates the emotional journey within the memoir, concluding with a peaceful and contented reflection on the past."
1263	13089	5	3	"Looking at the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the mood created by the author in the memoir is one of loving, happiness, and grateful. There are many examples showing this mood throughout the article. For instance, one of the moods created is shown in paragraph two, which is ""grateful."" The author writes: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" demonstrating that he loves them unconditionally anyways even if circumstances are good or bad. Another example of the mood grateful is in paragraph six, where he reinforces his feelings by telling his parents he is grateful, stating ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I thanked them repeatedly."" Importantly, he does it with profound love, which is another key mood present in the article. Those are the primary moods created by the author in the memoir, as evident in the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."""
1264	13090	5	3	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the mood that the author created was grateful, courageous, and generosity. First in the memoir, the primary mood that the author created is grateful. The author states that ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" That means he was very excited and happy that his parents passed down these specific skills to him, which is a key reason he feels so thankful. Next, his second mood is courageous because of the example set by his family. The author states that ""I often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" That means that all the times he had been with his mother or his dad they helped him through the challenges of his life and the difficulty of his education and demanding work. Lastly, his final mood was generosity, a value instilled in him from a young age. The author states that ""there is no way to express my spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" This suggests his family always depended on him to help with work around the house and in the yard, fostering a sense of shared responsibility. All in all, in this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the mood that the author conveyed was grateful, courageous, and generosity."
1265	13091	5	3	The author reveals a lot of his personal history and feelings in the story. The author creates a reflective mood that makes you think about your own self and your family. He talks fondly about his family and recounts stories from when he was a boy and where he grew up, painting a vivid picture of his childhood. The author also spoke about his parents and the details of their life, the struggles they faced and the dreams they held. He also talkes about how he and his parents lived in a neighborhood filled with other immigrants, creating a shared sense of community and experience. The author talks about how it is hard for him and his parents to live without the rest of their extended family, highlighting a sense of loss and longing. The author also talkes about how he loves music and how he loves his parents as well, connecting these two great passions. His parents helped him through difficult times and gave him hope for a better future. He also uses music to symbolize his life, its rhythms and emotions. Now he is a successful fashion designer, a testament to the foundation and inspiration his family provided, bringing his personal narrative to a fulfilling conclusion.
1266	13092	5	3	The mood created by the author was proud of being Cuban, a deep-seated pride in their heritage that the whole family possesses. This sentiment is woven through the narrative, highlighting a profound respect for their cultural roots and shared history. The author expresses a heartfelt gratitude with her parents and family, acknowledging the foundation of love and tradition they provided. This combination of pride and thankfulness establishes a warm and appreciative tone throughout the memoir, celebrating the enduring strength of their Cuban identity and familial bonds.
1267	13093	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents' hard work that shaped who he is today. The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going to the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and courage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood. Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author writes: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity within the community definitely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive and uplifting mood throughout the memoir, celebrating family, community, and the rewards of perseverance."
1268	13094	5	3	The author of the memoir created a mood that was intense, strange, happy, and sad. The feeling was happy because of the change from a simple house to a home, a transformation filled with love and effort. It was also sad because it is hard to leave something behind, to say goodbye to a place filled with memories. The mood was intense because it is hard to move on, creating a powerful emotional conflict within the narrative. Lastly, the mood was strong because he was strong enough to leave that behind even though it was hard, showing resilience in the face of change. These contrasting emotions combine to create a complex and deeply felt atmosphere in the story.
1269	13095	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very luring, like you read one sentence, then you want to read more, drawing the reader deeper into the personal journey. In the story, she says how her parents have to start their lives all over again, facing uncertainty and new challenges. But, then she says that they're just happy to be together in good old @LOCATION1, emphasizing that their unity was their greatest wealth. Just because you have very little, doesn't mean you can't live it out the fullest, a lesson that resonates strongly throughout the narrative. Be happy with what you got or don't have anything at all is what this story is telling me in my mind, promoting a philosophy of contentment and resilience. So I will follow my life to the best like Narciso and her family did, taking inspiration from their optimistic and determined spirit.
1270	13096	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was mellow because he's talking about his life and his gratefulness to have been raised in @LOCATION1, reflecting on his past with a sense of calm appreciation. Also the mood was happy, because he said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" which is him talking about how his parents made @LOCATION1 feel like home through their love and dedication. This statement infuses the narrative with a sense of joy and fond remembrance for the simple, yet profound, comforts of family life. These elements together establish the reflective and cheerful moods of the story, creating a heartfelt and nostalgic atmosphere for the reader."
1271	13097	5	3	The author that created the memoir created a cozy home feeling which made the reader feel the same way. The thing I mean by cozy home feeling is that the author showed how Narciso and his family got along and helped people in their family, friends, and people who just needed a little help. This sense of warmth was built through descriptions of shared meals and the constant, welcoming presence of his parents, who fostered an environment where everyone felt they belonged. The narrative effectively conveyed a comforting and inclusive atmosphere, making the reader appreciate the simple, profound acts of kindness that defined his childhood home.
1272	13098	5	3	The author's mood towards the memoir was ok I guess. In some areas it was low. It could have been better. The emotional tone felt somewhat flat during passages that described routine daily life, lacking the depth that could have made those sections more engaging. While not negative, the overall feeling was one of mild acceptance rather than strong enthusiasm, leaving room for a more resonant emotional connection with the material.
1273	13099	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by Narciso was happiness. I know this because of the following reasons. One way I know the mood was happiness is when the article said ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" This showed how Narciso was happy that his parents were nice and very caring, creating a joyful memory of generosity. Another way the mood was happiness is when the article said ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. & For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood."" this shows how he was happy to find a better definition of family through his stay at the house, a discovery that filled him with gratitude. The last way the mood was happiness is when the article said ""my mother & father had come to the country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture, they came selflessly."" Narciso showed happiness because his parents made it through their big change in their lives, and he felt proud of their resilience. This shows how the mood being created was happiness and that his parents are wonderful people."
1274	13100	5	3	"The mood in the memoir represents friendship, family, and helpfulness. One example of helpfulness is in the text where it says ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working, immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This illustrates a general spirit of support that defined the neighborhood. A good example of the mood in this memoir is family but also ties back to helping is when it says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family. Knowing that they would do the same for us."" This mutual trust and open-heartedness is what the memoir is about, highlighting the core values that shaped the author's experience."
1275	13101	5	3	They were sad through some of this memoir. The first reason why they were sad was that they left their families behind. They also had to leave the country of Cuba, a place filled with personal history. And left their friends too, which deepened their sense of loss. They were also happy too. The reason why is because it is a Spanish, Cuban, and American community, so they feel like they are at home among familiar customs and language. They were mad because they would have to start their life over from nothing. They would have to find new jobs and transportation, facing the daunting challenge of rebuilding their entire existence in a new land, which created a complex mix of emotions.
1276	13102	5	3	The mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood. This is primarily because the family was so excited about moving to a new place with better opportunities and educational purposes for the children. It also changed a regular house into a special home for them because they had people over and over and over, guests who frequently visited and eventually became like family through shared experiences. The neighbors also helped create this positive mood by not creating any negative action or violence, as the author put the family's location in a non-American neighborhood where a sense of communal peace prevailed. This overall environment of optimism and welcoming community firmly established the uplifting tone of the narrative.
1277	13103	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is kind and loving. It showed kindness in the text, where the memoir described how his parents made the whole house feel sweet and nice through their daily actions and generous spirit. He did this by using words like ""innocence"", ""celebrations"", and ""warm home"" to create the feel of kindness and a nurturing atmosphere. Love was shown when the author told about the way his parents welcomed anyone of every race to live with them until they ""got back on their feet,"" offering a safe haven without judgment. This shows love because when you are welcomed no matter what the problem is or who you are, it demonstrates love to everyone through unconditional acceptance and support. This consistent portrayal of compassion defines the memoir's heartfelt tone."
1278	13104	5	3	"When you have a loving family and a beautiful home, you should be very grateful, and Narciso Rodriguez was also very grateful. The overall mood of Narciso's story is gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey, to Cuban immigrant parents. His memoir explains how he is grateful for everything they provided, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He would always tell his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance in building a new life. His family cared for everybody and ""Always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us,"" extending their gratitude into action. All in all, the memoir's mood is gratefulness because Narciso was very grateful for everything, a sentiment that resonates throughout his recollections."
1279	13105	5	3	The mood of the memoir is that he is growing up in the house with his mother and father, immersed in a culture of generosity. His parents were dedicated to giving a hand to people who needed help, embodying this value daily. One explanation for this mood is when his parents moved here and left all of their friends and family in Cuba in hopes of making a better life for him and securing his future. Another is showing him about his culture through music, cooking, celebrations, and the important tradition of taking care of other people. His parents let people stay at their home when they needed to get on their feet, offering temporary shelter and support. And by always having people over for dinner, including aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, and friends, they fostered a continuous atmosphere of familial warmth and community that defined his upbringing.
1280	13106	5	3	"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the overarching mood in this memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love; his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give their son a better life, even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, and friends all behind just to give their son a better future. Also, after they arrived, they lived in a one-room apartment for a year and then moved to a new house, which they made into ""our traditional Cuban home."" They did this so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso when he was born, surrounding him with cultural touchstones. Even after that, they were still kind and had open arms for other immigrants, welcoming them into their community. So I absolutely think that the prevailing mood in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love, which forms the foundational core of the author's remembered experience."
1281	13107	5	3	"The author creates mood in the memoir in several ways. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This is an example because it is saying that in some environments everyone is your family, which evokes a feeling of communal warmth and belonging. In @NUM2 the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifices."" This is an example because he deeply appreciates everything that his parents did for him and he always will too, creating a sincere and thankful mood. That is how the author effectively creates a reflective and appreciative mood throughout the text."
1282	13108	5	3	"The author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir through his choice of language. The way he worded things, such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" showed how happy and fond he was of his parents. He told us how grateful he was for his parents being so selfless and for always thinking about him first. He also makes it clear how he is proud and how he greatly respects his parents for the great things they did to improve his life, highlighting their positive impact. Also, he shows how he admires his parents' hard work and bravery for the things they have done, which adds to the emotional depth. In conclusion, his overall mood is one of profound gratitude and deep respect toward his parents."
1283	13109	5	3	The author was in a respectful and reflective mood throughout the memoir. The text tells a lot about how his parents took care of him and about his life, detailing how his parents helped him through it with unwavering support. So when the author wrote this, he was in a somewhat happy and nostalgic mood because he looked back on all the good times they shared. However, that same nostalgia can also make you feel a touch of sadness, as those cherished moments are now memories. This blend of happiness and slight melancholy creates a complex and genuine emotional tone in the writing.
1284	13110	5	3	Narciso Rodriguez describes his life shaped by the hardships and selflessness of his humble and caring parents. The moods created by this author are happy and lighthearted, deeply inspired by his love and gratefulness. Narciso views his parents as saviors, who sacrificed everything to provide a better life to their children, a sentiment that fills the narrative. He is eternally grateful for their courageous acts that brought him incredible opportunities in @LOCATION1, which defines his perspective. He looks back happily at the warm and comfortable atmosphere of his home, remembering it with great fondness. He is grateful for his Cuban heritage that his family instilled in him at a young age, a core part of his identity. The unity of his close-knit community taught him honesty and the importance of hard work, values he carries with him. Narciso exudes love and a sense of pride in his incredible and hospitable family through his writing, setting a mood of gratefulness and true admiration for parents who taught him important life lessons he will never forget.
1285	13111	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy and grateful one. The author's parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 for their soon-to-be child, demonstrating immense sacrifice. They did that so that he could have a better education and for that he is very grateful, a feeling that permeates his recollections. The author loved his home and had great times there, recalling it with vivid affection. It is his most favorite place in the whole world and that is why he talks about his home in great detail, emphasizing its significance. The author had great family memories in the kitchen with Cuban music and the scent of Cuban food, which contributed to his joyful nostalgia. The author's mood is grateful, primarily for what his parents did for him by moving to provide a new life. It also is happy because of all the great times he had there, surrounded by love and culture. The author would probably want to relive those times, just as many people wish to relive the cherished moments of their own childhood.
1286	13112	5	3	"The mood created by the author is one of nostalgic remembrance, looking back at the old days and reflecting on how he used to live, expressing how much he admires his family but mostly his parents. He came to the United States in 1956, and in 1961, he was born into a simple house. The prevailing mood is that he deeply admires his parents for striving to give their children a better life, even though they left behind their own families, close friends, and established careers in the country they loved, all just for their children's future. The author states he will always be grateful to his parents for their profound love and immense sacrifice, noting, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" Therefore, the mood that the author shows is mostly love for his parents, his family, his friends, and for Cuba. He thanks and learns from both of his parents for all they did to push forward for their children, no matter what they had to sacrifice for them, a sentiment that forms the core of his reflection."
1287	13113	5	3	The author's mood that is created in the memoir is one of profound love and deep gratitude. The author expresses how thankful he is to his parents for the opportunity to live and grow up in the loving home they made for him. He says that he knows that family is not just blood related, a belief his parents embodied through their actions. He tells how his parents had open arms and open doors to people in the community who needed help or companionship. Their home was consistently filled with vibrant @CAPS1 music, delicious food, and an abundance of love. They would host celebrations for his birthdays and to mark people's arrival to the new country, fostering a warm and welcoming environment. There was this pervasive atmosphere of love and thankfulness throughout his life, and that heartfelt sentiment is genuinely expressed in this memoir, leaving a lasting impression of warmth and appreciation.
1288	13114	5	3	The mood created by the author is that @PERSON1 is genuinely grateful for what he has in his life. @PERSON1 is specifically grateful for his parents' decision and courage in arriving in @LOCATION1 to build a new life. As a testament to his heritage, @PERSON1 likes to cook traditional Cuban food and listen to authentic Cuban music, which keeps him connected to his roots. The mood also strongly suggests that @PERSON1 is most grateful to his parents for being brave enough for coming to @LOCATION1, and he is profoundly grateful for his parents' endless love and personal sacrifise. @PERSON1 says he will never forget how his parents, through their dedication and warmth, turned a simple house into a true and loving home, a place filled with cherished memories and a deep sense of belonging.
1289	13115	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir would be one of feeling deeply grateful and ultimately happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it can be, thanks to the sacrifices of parents and grandparents, even ancestors who paved the way. It makes you want to love and appreciate your parents even more after seeing how they went through a lot and probably gave up a great deal for you, like leaving their beloved homeland or giving up great things, just as @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr did for their family or son. They primarily wanted a better life and superior education for their kids. To achieve this, they had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised, and give up some things to get better things in return. They had to give up their jobs and skills they already knew how to do perfectly well for the promise of better opportunities. The good thing that happened, or that they gained, is more freedom and a better life and education; it's not easy leaving everything you love and the place where you are born, but it has to be done for better things and opportunities. Reading this memoir gives you or leaves you with a satisfying, grateful, happy and kinda sad mood, a complex but poignant mix of emotions that honors the struggle and the reward.

In chapter @NUM1 it talks about the overall feelings of love and care that surrounded the Rodriguez household like a comfy blanket, providing a constant sense of warmth. Also, it talks about how the ""... congregration of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both..."" helped pave the road for a great childhood with many friends and family members who where always there for Narciso Rodriguez to rely on in times of need. Another example of the comfort within the Rodriguez home is that the ""... parents always kept their arms and door open to many of the people... considered family, knowing that they would do the same..."" This portrays an overall image of a community where everyone got along and helped each other out, reinforcing a supportive network. Last but not least Narciso's home was ""...always filled... (with) life and love."" Where he felt secure and cared for, a true sanctuary from the outside world. All in all, the household that @PERSON2 lived in was a household filled with love, care and especially comfort that every child should have, establishing a lasting sense of peace and belonging."
1298	13124	5	3	"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood filled with gratitude. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood, focusing on their positive attributes. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help, creating an inviting and generous atmosphere. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family and their selfless actions. Throughout the whole excerpt, Rodriguez lists many times he was happy and grateful for everything his parents have done for him, which sets a positive mood of appreciation and fond remembrance that resonates with the reader."
1299	13125	5	3	"There are many ways the mood was created by the author in the memoir through specific techniques. One way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's past memories, which evoke a specific sensory and emotional atmosphere. An example of this was ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air."" This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because culture music came from the author's memories, which is the mood of vibrant nostalgia. Another way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's opinions of the memories, which color the recollection with personal sentiment. An example of this was in paragraph @NUM1 ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because the author expressed their opinions in there own way which set the mood of profound thankfulness. Ultimately, the interplay of vivid memory and personal reflection successfully establishes the memoir's overall emotional tone."
1300	13126	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, shows an specific mood of contentment. The mood from this is happieness and satisfaction derived from simple, meaningful aspects of life. The family is happy because they got a new home, they have a child, and they made pretty good friends from the nabiorhood, all of which contribute to their joy. The satisfaction part is in there too when they are satisfiyed with what they got like, a job, a home, family, friends, and they are makeing money, feeling a sense of accomplishment. After all moods depend on your surroundings, like the people not the merchendise, highlighting the value of relationships over material possessions. And thats all that matters in creating a truly happy and fulfilling life, which is the central message conveyed by the author."
1301	13127	5	3	"By reading the memoir I know that a family isn't just a family because they are blood relatives; a family is about loving each other and always being there for each other. The author is grateful for everything his parents have done, recognizing their unwavering support and the strong bond they share. For example, in paragraph one he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a sentiment that highlights the deep appreciation he holds for their efforts. This reinforces the idea that true family is defined by mutual love and commitment, not merely by biological ties. Ultimately, the memoir teaches that the essence of family lies in these enduring connections and the selfless care its members provide for one another."
1302	13128	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez, from a Cuban born and raised childhood, values everything they ever did for him, appreciating the cultural foundation they provided. As stated in the passage, he ""is eternally thankful for all that his family done whether it was the traditional Cuban food they cooked him or whether it was the Cuban music they made him listen to."" Growing up in a multiracial community made him accustomed to being a non-segregated individual, which further shaped his inclusive worldview. The mood he sets when narrating this is grateful because, not once did he ever take life for granted. He reflects, ""I will always be grateful for what my parents showed within love and sacrifice, and I often told them for what they have done was more courageous than I could have ever reached,"" a statement that perfectly encapsulates his profound and thankful perspective."
1303	13129	5	3	"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez was a loving, caring, thoughtful feeling which came from his childhood home, imbuing the narrative with a sense of warmth. In the passage, it states ""A Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote shows how much love and caring the mood is and makes the mood a more loving and thoughtful feeling, emphasizing the richness of his family life. In the passage it states ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love."" In this quote the reader feels the mood which was love and the author inquires it with his word choice, drawing the reader into his sentimental recollection. Also in this passage it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote signifies all three moods—loving, caring, and the thoughtfulness of the memoir. It describes how the mood was brought on, how it was and the meanings, illustrating the transformative power of familial love. The mood of the story is touching with all the warmth of love brought into the house, instead of caring about the possessions with greed, ultimately celebrating the intangible gifts of a close-knit family."
1304	13130	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is reflective of how he was living with his family in the house, conveying a sense of nostalgic warmth. The specific relevant detail in the story is said ""the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friend and endless celebration,"" which paints a vivid picture of a vibrant and communal upbringing. This quote shows how he was living with many people and he is an immigrant, highlighting the bustling, supportive environment that defined his early years. The mood is one of fond remembrance for a time filled with simple joys and the constant presence of loved ones. Through this recollection, the author successfully communicates the profound sense of belonging and community that characterized his immigrant experience."
1305	13131	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring, establishing a tone of deep reflection. ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done,"" the author writes, showing his profound respect for his parents' journey. Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family, and this sense of gratitude permeates his narrative. The mood in this memoir is not just thoughtful or kind or caring, it's the feeling of being loved and loving that feeling, which forms the emotional core of his story. His realization that ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family"" serves as a powerful conclusion, affirming that family is built on a foundation of courage, love, and mutual appreciation."
1306	13132	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood he created is one of profound gratitude. First, he is deeply grateful to his family. For example, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM1). From this, you can understand how much he sincerely appreciates what his parents have selflessly given him. Next, Narciso is grateful for being part of such a caring and supportive family. He says ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@NUM1). This quote explains how much his family taught him about being kind and giving. Finally, he is grateful to know such wonderful people in his life. Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbors, or the many things I learned there about how to love"" (@NUM3). To sum it all up, the overarching mood Narciso Rodriguez created for his memoir is one of sincere gratitude for the people who shaped his life."
1307	13133	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this personal memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation. I think @PERSON1 wrote this memoir for his parents as a tribute. He wanted to portray that even though most people would think that he had a tough life, he would completely disagree with that assessment. He realizes that his parents did what they did so @PERSON1 would have a better life and more opportunities. He appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family, creating a welcoming atmosphere. They were loving, caring, heartwarming people who built a strong foundation for him. Like @PERSON1 said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a sentiment that perfectly captures his deep appreciation for their efforts."
1308	13134	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood is very grateful and appreciative. All throughout the story, the author kept stating that he is extremely grateful to his parents for their selflessness and unwavering care. This mood shows most prominently in paragraph @NUM1 because he continually thanks his parents for moving to the United States from Cuba to help him when he is born and provide a new future. He thanks them for leaving their friends, family and jobs to help him, even if the new jobs they get are not what they deserve and represent a significant sacrifice. So, as you can see, the author is very grateful to his parents for their immense sacrifices, making this the definitive mood of the entire piece."
1309	13135	5	3	The author said that he had never seen his real grandfather until they were allowed to leave Cuba, an event that finally occurred in @DATE1. After they were permitted to emigrate, they were reunited with their whole family in New Jersey, which was the place where they ultimately wanted to live and build their new life together in the United States.
1310	13136	5	3	"I think that the mood created by the speaker is one of deep gratitude. I think this is clear when he discusses his parents and states they ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This shows that he sincerely appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills and this lasting passion. Another example when Narciso is thankful is his statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 they gave up their professional jobs of working in a laboratory and chemical engineering to make his life better, a fact he does not take for granted. This shows that the speaker was consistently creating a tone of heartfelt gratefulness throughout his reminiscence."
1311	13137	5	3	"In the memoir in ""@PERSON1 Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1, the overall mood of the story is happy. The reason it's happy is evident if you hear the tone in which she is telling us. She writes with warmth, ""I was born into a simple house situated in a two-family, blonde brick building in the *** section of Newark, New Jersey. My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" @CAPS1 sounds happy and proud to be Cuban, which is a core part of @CAPS1's identity. This pride and contentment are central to the happy mood of the memoir. Another reason it's happy is found in the line, ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood."" @CAPS1 cares deeply about his family, and @CAPS1 now embodies the values and love that his parents showed him. This profound appreciation for family and heritage is why the overall mood is happy and fondly remembered."
1312	13138	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood that is created by the author is a loving and grateful mood towards the author's parents. An example from the memoir is when the author talks about his gratefulness toward his parents, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote clearly shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful toward his parents because he explicitly mentions his gratefulness towards them. Another example is when the author tells the reader that his parents showed him two important lessons that he chose for the basis of his life. He reflects, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote demonstrates that the author's mood is loving and grateful towards his parents because he acknowledges that what they did helped him become a better person. Lastly, when the author tells the reader that he is grateful for the fact that his parents gave up their life in Cuba to make his life better, noting, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (paragraph @NUM3). This quote shows that the author's mood is loving and grateful because he expresses deep appreciation for his parents' selfless actions. Through these reflections, the author successfully creates a loving and grateful mood toward his parents in this memoir."
1313	13139	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir feels like that of simplicity and home. He talks of the music and the familiar smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything alongside him. He describes his home and his childhood in such a relaxed and fond way, and he notes how the people in his neighborhood were also good to each other. It gives the impression that his early life was like a relaxed dream where everything felt right and secure. He talks of all his relatives that lived nearby, and from the perspective of being a child, the reader feels a somewhat comforted and safe sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make the reader feel as if there is pure, selfless love left in the world. Though this story proves the profound love of two parents for their children, and that powerful, affirming message alone creates a sense of peaceful closure for the reader.
1314	13140	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the overall mood is happy. Narciso is happy with his family and his culture, expressing a deep contentment with his roots and upbringing. He is glad that he is with his family, and this familial bond is a great source of his joy. Narciso Rodriguez also loves his talent and the creative path he has chosen, which contributes to his positive outlook. He is just a little sad that he won't be able to meet his real grandparents, and that is the only thing that brings a touch of sorrow to his story. Other than that single, wistful note, he is as happy as can be, filled with appreciation for the life he has been given.
1315	13141	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. An example of where this mood is shown is this quote from the memoir, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is talking about how everybody in his neighborhood acted as one large family, even though people were of very different nationalities. It shows that the author had a very loving and inclusive community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood. Another example is when the author states, ""...I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the deep love he feels for his parents, his house, and all the residents in the neighborhood. A third and final example of the loving mood within the memoir is when the author writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he loves his parents for giving him opportunities, even when it may have cost them something they loved. The author created a loving mood in the memoir because that was how he remembered his childhood; it was a time filled with love from his family and community."
1316	13142	5	3	The mood in this story is predominantly sad because the person leaves their homeland of Cuba and experiences the death of someone in the family, creating a profound sense of loss. But despite this sorrow, the person holds onto big dreams and, through perseverance, eventually becomes a successful fashion designer, achieving their lifelong ambition. This journey from grief to accomplishment defines the narrative's emotional arc, concluding with a sense of hard-won fulfillment.
1317	13143	5	3	"In the article about Narciso Rodriguez the tone is consistently loving, peaceful, and happy. In this memoir it talks about family and friends coming together as one, creating a warm and unified atmosphere. In the article the best example of this happiness and peace is found in the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows joy because it emphasizes they are all together in a place filled with love. Another example is in paragraph seven where he says ""I learned the real definition of family."" This is loving because it shows he is happy and he genuinely enjoys being with his friends and family. Another reason why the tone is grateful is because he explicitly states ""... there is no way I can express my gratitude..."" this is happy because he is deeply thankful for what everyone does for him. In conclusion, the overall tone is happy, loving, and grateful, reflecting a life cherished."
1318	13144	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is profoundly grateful. The author is grateful for many reasons, with his appreciation centered on his parents, his home, his culture, and his extended family. This is evident because he mentioned these topics frequently throughout the memoir. One specific reason he is grateful is for his parents' culinary skills, as stated in the text: ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Another reason the author is grateful is for the love his parents gave him, believing that without their love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he possesses today. This is clear when he said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Furthermore, the author is grateful for his family because they are always there for him, which is why his parents always kept the door open to family. Ultimately, the author is grateful for life and love, which were ever-present when he learned the real definition of family, and this is why he would never forget the place he called home."
1319	13145	5	3	"The mood created by the author of this memoir is a mixture of a few different, yet harmonious, moods. The author is clearly proud and grateful for his family, home, and culture, which contributes to an overall relaxed and peaceful mood. For example, he humbly calls his house a ""simple house,"" indicating a lack of pretense. He also talks a lot about family and all of the people he cares about, which the author uses to craft a very loving and caring atmosphere. He speaks repeatedly about the love for the people and things in his life that he holds dear. He says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That sentence alone shows a very loving and caring mood because it demonstrates that he truly loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him. The last sentence in the memoir says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows a mixture of both moods perfectly. It shows his love for his parents for making their house a home, but it also feels very peaceful and relaxed because it shows that throughout the memoir the author maintained a consistent mood of not letting adversity get to him and being genuinely grateful for the things he has."
1320	13146	5	3	"The memoir establishes a thankful and grateful mood. The author is grateful that she has parents who moved to a new country for her future. Also, she is grateful that the simple place she lives in feels like a true home, a sentiment captured in the last sentence: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Furthermore, the author's thankfulness is powerfully illustrated in another paragraph: ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" This passage underscores how thankful the author is to her parents, who sacrificed their whole previous life for her. If that was me writing that story, I would also make the mood very grateful towards my parents, as their selfless act is the foundation of the narrative."
1321	13147	5	3	"Memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author explains his family in a very @CAPS1 way. The author talks about his love of cooking, how his parents want to give their children a better life by moving to @LOCATION1 leaving loved ones behind, and the author @CAPS1 his house. The kitchen was the very heart of the home to the author. His parents were very skilled in cooking, a passion which was lovingly passed onto their children. The author says on paragraph @NUM1, ""Ö A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author's deep and enduring love for culinary skills. Next, is how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about @LOCATION1, but moved there just to give a better life for their children. The parents had to leave their loved families, friends, and country. For example, on paragraph @NUM2, it explains what the parents had to sacrifice. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows the parents really loved their children and profoundly wanted them to be happy. Finally, the last sentence of the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" states how the narrator feels deep love for his parents and his home. This all shows that the narrator is happy with his family and is pleased with where he lives. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is @CAPS1. The author shows this by @CAPS1 the culinary art of his parents, and his home. He is grateful for what he has, and has love for his family and home."
1322	13148	5	3	The mood of the memoir I believe to be grateful or @CAPS1. Narciso's parents are immigrants from Cuba who live in a racist community and are working tirelessly to be able to support their kids. They are great parents to Narciso and provide him with basic necessities. They feed him, and buy him clothes, ensuring his well-being. Narciso is very kind and thankful for the trouble his mother and father go through and he is also very considerate to try to help them when they need it, understanding their struggles. The mood is grateful because that is how Narciso feels towards his parents for all their efforts and sacrifices on his behalf.
1323	13149	5	3	"Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1 in life. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Narciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the text, which is overwhelmingly one of thankfulness and appreciation."
1324	13150	5	3	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family where you're not expecting to. He sets the mood in the memoir, that portrays love, warmth, and happiness. The overall mood of the memoir is loving. Like how Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love."" When Narciso was growing up he learned that ""... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and friendship, creating a strong sense of community. So Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, @CAPS1 mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up in that special environment."
1325	13151	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratefulness. The memoir showed how grateful Narciso was to his parents for their immense sacrifices. Their bravery and selflessness must have truly impacted his life then and probably how he lives today. It also gives the feeling of respect. In this memoir it shows how much he truly respected his parents and his wider community for their support. And last I think it gives the mood of admiration. The memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community. It showed how much he admired his parents' bravery and he admired his own family's overcoming of odds. He also admired how a community of different races could get over their differences and pull together to really make a unified community. Those are some of the key moods that are expressed in this memoir, painting a picture of a thankful and reflective individual.
1326	13152	5	3	The author created many different moods in this memoir. An obvious one is Love. As a child, she deeply appreciated that her parents secured a new home and moved to a new neighborhood to raise their child. She cherished her Cuban background and the vibrant environment that she grew up in, a place filled with the warmth of family traditions and the familiar sounds of her heritage. This foundational love for her family and culture permeates the narrative, establishing a heartfelt tone that underscores her formative experiences and the secure, affectionate world her parents built for her. Ultimately, this sense of love is presented as the central, sustaining force throughout her childhood memories.
1327	13153	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is generosity. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, talks about how much generosity his parents had. He says, ""My parents always kept their arm and their doors open to the many people we considered family,"" illustrating a home that was a constant hub of welcome and support. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" In the memoir Narciso says that he will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, a debt he feels profoundly. His dad worked in a laboratory in Cuba and his mom had studied chemical engineering in Cuba, yet in the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find to provide for their family. He says that this house was where I learned the real definition of family, a lesson taught through his parents' unwavering example. He also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a place defined not by its appearance but by the generous spirit within it. His parents were generous, grateful, brave and had courage, embodying these virtues through their daily actions and sacrifices. We should all be grateful for what our parents sacrifice for us or had sacrificed, as their selfless acts form the foundation upon which our own lives are built."
1328	13154	5	3	The mood that the author had set in the memoir went from a calm beginning to an emotional one, telling about how hard his childhood was and how his family was struggling with their jobs and their financial problems. The initial calm is gradually overshadowed by a growing tension as the author recounts the constant worries and the strain that financial instability placed on the household. This emotional shift effectively conveys the anxiety and hardship they endured, painting a vivid picture of a family working tirelessly to make ends meet despite overwhelming challenges. The memoir thus moves from a state of perceived normalcy to one of poignant struggle, capturing the difficult reality of his early years.
1329	13155	5	3	"The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And in Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of their new community. They took those cultural elements and infused them into their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home,"" a true sanctuary built from sacrifice. By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them, creating a perfect, resonant mood to enjoy the reading and reflect on the sacrifices made for our own benefit."
1330	13156	5	3	"The author's mood in this memoir is gratefulness, happiness, and gratitude. In one paragraph, the author shows happiness, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" As you can see the author was very happy to move to a new place to start a new, fulfilled life surrounded by joy and community. In another paragraph, the author shows gratitude towards his willing parents. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" here the author shows that he's extremely grateful for what his parents did to help him make a new life, acknowledging the immense cost of their decision. Lastly, in a further paragraph, the author gives a direct explanation for why he's grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author in this memoir shows an extreme amount of gratitude, happiness, and gratefulness, to his sacrificing parents, and this profound appreciation forms the enduring emotional core of his reflective narrative."
1331	13157	5	3	The mood clearly shows that Narciso loves his family very much, as his actions and words consistently reflect a deep sense of devotion and care for them, ensuring their well-being and happiness are always his primary concern. This profound affection forms the foundation of his character and motivations throughout the narrative, illustrating a bond that is both unwavering and central to his identity. His love is not merely stated but is demonstrated through his daily interactions and the sacrifices he is willing to make, ultimately defining the emotional core of the story and its heartfelt conclusion.
1332	13158	5	3	"In this memoir there is a distinct mood created by the author, which is calm, happy, and relaxing. The author establishes this atmosphere by describing how ""passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This sensory detail contributes to the mood of relaxing because hearing enjoyable music and smelling pleasant scents from cooking can be deeply soothing experiences. Furthermore, the memoir notes that most people in the neighborhood were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants who were honest, hardworking people willing to extend a hand to others. This description fosters a sense of calmness, as knowing your neighbors are trustworthy and similar to you eliminates worries and creates a peaceful environment. The final element of the mood is happiness, which is shown through the author's expressed gratitude for his parents. He states he is grateful for their love, sacrifice, and courage, and he admires their strength and perseverance. Together, these elements combine to form the calm, happy, and relaxing mood created by the author in this memoir."
1333	13159	5	3	The mood of this story centers on Narciso and his profound affection for his family and his house. He loves his home because even though they live in a new location, it still feels authentically Cuban, providing a comforting sense of cultural continuity and belonging. With his family being there, he knows they will always be there for him and help him through any challenges, creating a supportive and secure environment. This unwavering family support is the cornerstone of his contentment and the positive atmosphere he describes, solidifying the narrative's warm and devoted mood.
1334	13160	5	3	"In the excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Narciso Rodriguez's Home: The Print of our Lives, the author creates a very warm theme by painting a picture in the reader's mind of a family from the past that lived in unity and supported each other, pulling through in the very end. The author mentions several details from which one can infer the sensation of a strong, supportive family that has everything it needs. As the author tells us, ""In 1961… my family, [in a] blond brick building… created our traditional Cuban home… [The] very heart [was the] kitchen… [with] rich culinary skills and a love of cooking… Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen… [The] innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends… [and] endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote resonates with not just literal meaning, but with a feeling that's hard to obtain—like the comfort of sitting around a campfire with friends and family. This feeling is crafted by the author's descriptive language, displaying a masterpiece to the reader. Specific language like ""very heart"" and ""warm house"" is what truly conveys this comforting atmosphere. In conclusion, the author uses language that appeals to a reader's sense of safety, warmth, and unity to successfully create a warm theme in his memoir."
1335	13161	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness. This is evident in the last sentence where the narrator says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" which means that the mood is very happy and that this feeling is profoundly great. The author has many positive memories of the home and also learned valuable lessons from what his parents taught him, all of which contribute to this uplifting atmosphere. This mood is consistently positive and happy because the passage is filled with recollections of good memories and the strong bonds between friends and family. Such fond recollections include, for instance, the significant event of when they first moved from Cuba to the United States to start their lives anew, a journey underpinned by hope and familial love."
1336	13162	5	3	the mood is that the author is very good at conveying a sense of deep appreciation and heartfelt sentiment throughout his writing, which resonates strongly with the reader and leaves a lasting, positive impression.
1337	13163	5	3	"I think the mood of the author is love and family. In this article, he keeps saying how grateful he is to his parents, emphasizing the profound impact they had on his life and values. A quote proving this is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that he loved how his parents loved him, and made sacrifices for him, and he will always be grateful to them for their unwavering support. He also says that he now knows the true definition of family, a concept that was clearly demonstrated through his parents' actions. A quote proving this is ""... Family had nothing to do with a blood relative."" This quote shows that even if people aren't blood-related, they are still family, highlighting a theme of chosen kinship. Narciso Rodriguez says that his parents welcomed anyone with open arms, creating an inclusive and supportive environment. A quote proving this is ""it was in this house where my parents welcomed other refugees..."" This quote shows how loving his family was, extending their warmth beyond their immediate household. Family really is a strong bond that will last forever, a central truth that the author beautifully illustrates through his personal reflections."
1338	13164	5	3	"The mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez, is warming and caring, evoking a genuine sense of comfort and affection in the reader. From this memoir you can tell there was a lot of love, understanding, patience, and gratitude in this family, qualities that formed the very foundation of his childhood home. He was greatly affected by his parents selflessness, which is a recurring and powerful theme throughout his narrative, and I'm sure he will be as loving and wonderful to his own family because of what they taught him about compassion and generosity."
1339	13165	5	3	the mood created by the author is a serious and reflective mood. The mood is serious because he is explaining his childhood and his home with a thoughtful and considered tone, focusing on the formative experiences that shaped him. he explains how his parents raised him, detailing the values and lessons they imparted. He also explained how his parents left their homeland, underscoring the weight of their sacrifices and the challenges they faced. That was the definitive mood of the author's narrative, one of solemn gratitude and introspection.
1340	13166	5	3	In the nonfiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez by the author, the author creates a curious and warm mood by talking about his origin, talking about his upbringing, and talking about his memories. First of all, the author talks about the Cuban family he was raised into in Newark, New Jersey. He tells the reader that he lived in a two-family home with Cuban immigrants, providing a specific and vivid setting for his story. The author's origin makes the reader curious because they want to know more about the author's background and cultural roots. Also, the author talks about his life in an immigrant community and how he was exposed to Cuban music, foods, and culture from his parents, which enriched his daily life. The author's upbringing makes the reader curious and warm because they want to know more about these experiences, and learning about the vibrant cultures and celebrations gives the reader a warm and inviting feeling. Last but not least, the author talks about his loving parents and the memorable Cuban feasts they hosted, which were filled with joy and community. The author's memories make the reader feel warm because such expressions of love and family are universally heartwarming. As you can see, the author effectively creates a curious and warm mood through these detailed recollections.
1341	13167	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy because he was always grateful for everything his parents had done for him, such as teaching him to cook and showing him love. My opinion is that I think Narciso Rodriguez had told us students and adults a little bit of his life because he might want people to understand what he had went through in his life, and see how he got this way and how he got to where he is today or now through his family's support and his own hard work.
1342	13168	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was a peaceful, loving mood. Narciso says that his three-room home usually had someone staying there temporarily until they could get back on their feet, reflecting his parents' generosity. In Narciso's neighborhood, despite different customs, all cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a strong and supportive community for everyone who lived there.
1343	13169	5	3	"In Narciso Rodriguez from: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates the mood of family and love in the memoir. Narciso was a boy who lived with his parents in a three-room apartment. The heart of the house was the kitchen and that was where his parents taught him to cook and showed him passionate Cuban music. In the house, ""...the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (1)."" Then, Narciso realized that "" 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (2), which showed that a neighborhood made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants could get along. Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem; the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (3). ""It was in this simple house... where I learned the real definition of 'family.' And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (4). This profound sense of belonging defined his entire upbringing."
1344	13170	5	3	"The mood in the memoir was that the author was grateful. He was grateful for many things like love for cooking and grateful for his parents. He is happy he has this family and he is happy that he has the simple house he was born in. There are a few choices the mood could be, but the one that the author has written about is happiness. He grew up where he had friends or family to have someone that they trust. He also had his landlord and first friend that helped grace their kitchen table for meals. His parents opened the door for family members, knowing that others would do the same. He thinks his parents are brave that they would have courage to come to America, knowing that they would leave everything behind. He is most happy about how he learned about the real meaning of ""family"" from their selfless example."
1345	13171	5	3	The author creates an optimistic, caring mood in his memoir. He described the strong sense of love and kinship in his home, where family and friends always gathered. These emotions came out in the writing, making the reader feel the connection. The passage, being about his home, sent out a very homey vibe that was comforting. One can feel the warmth, love, and roots in this memoir through the detailed descriptions of daily life. The loving mood of this excerpt has many subdivisions of emotions, all contributing to an overall feeling of security and belonging that defined his childhood.
1346	13172	5	3	"Home is where the heart is, and nothing says that more than in the memoir Home: The Blueprints of My Life. In the memoir, it talks about family and that wherever your heart is, is where your home is. The memoir gives a tingling and loving mood, evoking a sense of warmth and deep affection. It makes us feel happy and feel loving, especially in a few sections. First, when the author talked about what his family did at home, it made the world slow down and think about the family. Narciso (the author and narrator) said in paragraph two, ""endless celebrations and that encompassed both, formed the back drop to our life in our warm home"". This made a picture of a happy and laughing family like in the movies about the holidays, filled with joy and togetherness. Second, Narciso said how united they all were. This painted a mood of unity and care. In paragraph four @PERSON1 recalled, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". This makes the reader think of friendship and hope in trouble times, reinforcing the idea of a supportive community. The mood that came was loving and that tingling feeling of hope. Most people can't find that feeling anymore, especially in these tough times. What most people do know is that home is not a building, it's a sanctuary, a place of safety and unconditional love where one truly belongs."
1347	13173	5	3	The mood of the author I think is caring; but then I also think it's calm. I think it is caring because of the way he talks about the neighborhood, showing a genuine concern for the people and places within it. I also think it's caring because he understood what was going on around him, demonstrating empathy and a thoughtful perspective on the events he describes. But I think it is calm because the way that he speaks, it's in a calm tone, using measured and gentle language that soothes the reader. This combination of a caring nature expressed through a calm and steady voice creates a reflective and reassuring atmosphere throughout the text, allowing the reader to feel a sense of peace and understanding.
1348	13174	5	3	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is a very good and happy mood. You can tell by how he is always talking about both happy family moments and his Cuban heritage and works, music, which are described with clear fondness and joy. His recollections are filled with vibrant energy and positive emotion, celebrating the cultural traditions and the artistic expressions that defined his upbringing. The author’s focus on these uplifting aspects of his life, from familial bonds to cultural pride, consistently fosters an atmosphere that is both cheerful and deeply content. This consistent emphasis on happiness and cultural celebration successfully conveys a profoundly positive and uplifting mood to the reader.
1349	13175	5	3	"The author creates a peaceful mood in the memoir. It's peaceful because you can just picture the admiration in his voice when he talks about his family, a tone that is both respectful and tender. One reason he loves his family is because, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same."" This means that their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help, creating a secure and welcoming environment. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This means that even though everything they have known is in Cuba, they wanted their children to have better lives and chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on, an act of profound love that contributes to the overall sense of tranquility and gratitude. These are some examples as to why the author has set a peaceful mood in the memoir, establishing a tone of serene appreciation for the sacrifices and love that built his home."
1350	13176	5	3	In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. That's telling us they get along well and really care for each other, highlighting a foundation of mutual respect and deep affection. And then there is his siblings that live in different parts of the apartment. They help set the table and eat with them so I can tell they are all really loving and caring and all enjoy being a family together, finding joy in these simple, shared daily rituals. The description of these family interactions, filled with cooperation and shared meals, reinforces the strong bonds between them. This is why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood, illustrating how familial love manifests in everyday actions and creates a harmonious and comforting home life.
1351	13177	5	3	"In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by @PERSON1, the author creates a distinct mood. I think this is the mood of acceptance. @PERSON2 talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood with many other immigrants, which was a place of welcome. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country,"" highlighting their open-hearted nature. This shows that no matter how diverse people were, the author's family always accepted them and their differences without judgment. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, and knowing they would do the same for us."" This is another example of how loving and accepting the home that Rodriguez grew up in truly was, a place where community was paramount. It also shows how close, kind, and loving this community was, as depicted in ""@PERSON2"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, ultimately painting a picture of a supportive and inclusive environment."
1352	13178	5	3	"In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 ponders and reminisces about past events centered on his parents' home in Newark, New Jersey. The author creates a subtle, but happy memory in the passage, blending different emotional tones. The first reason why the mood is a subtle, but happy one would be because there are serious parts of the passage, and happy parts of the passage that coexist. In paragraph four, Narciso recalls having a lot of his family members living near his family's house, which contributed to a sense of belonging. When @CAPS1 says, ""Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table,"" he refers to the supper table when he says, ""our table,"" evoking warm family gatherings. The mood gets subtle when @CAPS2 talks about being grateful to his parents for coming to @CAPS3 as immigrants with no working knowledge of the @CAPS4 language or writing, acknowledging their struggles. @CAPS1 also says in paragraph five, ""to give their children a better life,"" @CAPS5, which adds a layer of solemn appreciation. These are many terrific details that work together to explain the nuanced mood that Narciso is trying to convey in this passage."
1353	13179	5	3	"I think the mood that this author is creating is one of love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents, and this deep affection is central to the narrative. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement powerfully conveys their sacrifice. Another aspect of the mood is that they took their Cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house but enriching it with their heritage. Determination also plays a big part in this mood. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life, and this resolve is felt throughout the story. Mood is the overall feeling in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination, all of which combine to create a heartfelt and inspiring atmosphere."
1354	13180	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso @CAPS1 from Home: The Blueprints Of Our Lives, is bittersweet but happy and loving at the same time. Narciso creates a bittersweet mood because he explains about his family's troubles and the experiences of his friends and local neighbors, acknowledging the hardships they faced. Narciso explains what they went through, which makes a person feel reflective and empathetic. Narciso also creates a happy and loving mood because he would describe how people came from all over; a community ""Made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" would come to this one city, where they would unite and help one another. They would also consider each other one big family, which consists of happy and loving interactions and a strong support system. Those are the contrasting yet harmonious moods the author, Narciso Rodriguez, skillfully creates in the memoir, illustrating a full picture of his childhood experiences."
1355	13181	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was really grateful and emphasized that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, as highlighted in paragraph @NUM1. This expanded definition of family is a key part of the narrative's warmth. Also, it shows how grateful he is about his family because in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This shows that he is really happy and grateful for what he has and that he actually realizes how many sacrifices they did for him and how much they love him, which fills him with a profound sense of appreciation. The overall tone is one of deep thankfulness for the love and community that shaped his life."
1356	13182	5	3	"The author gave a distinct voice and cultural mood to the memoir. He talks about the music and food of his childhood, the vibrant sounds and aromas that filled his youth, but he also talks about his extended ""family"" and how they always had someone staying in the house until they could get back on their feet. This sense of community was a cornerstone of his upbringing. He also talks about how the house itself doesn't make a home- its the people that do. If no one lived in a house, it would be just an empty structure; it could never be called a home. The family and friends, with their shared lives and mutual support, bring it closer and closer to being a true home, transforming the physical space into a place of warmth and belonging."
1357	13183	5	3	"In this memoir Narciso talks about his life. As he talks, he always creates a specific mood by talking about his environment and the people in it. In one paragraph it says, ""that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative,"" highlighting his broad definition of kinship. Narciso created a good mood because he knows he has a lot of friends who form his support system. Secondly, Narciso creates a mood by talking about his first friend. In another paragraph it says, ""Alegria lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not,"" which establishes a good mood for having a friend that is so close and familiar. Finally, he creates a mood talking about his parents. In a further paragraph it says, ""My mother and father had come here with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" He is in a good and grateful mood because his parents had a lot of courage to build a new life. Clearly, through these reflections, Narciso creates a consistent and heartfelt mood in the memoir."
1358	13184	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was happy and profoundly grateful. One way this is shown is through the statement: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, and many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" For example, he was proud and appreciative of what his parents did by coming to a new land with such courage and determination. A second way is through his declaration, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" For example, you always thank your parents when they do something meaningful for you, and his words reflect this deep-seated gratitude. This is how the author effectively describes his positive and thankful mood throughout his writing."
1359	13185	5	3	"Home is where the heart is, a sentiment that resonates deeply in this context. In this case, his ""Family"" is his heart, the center of his emotional world, and his house is his home because of their presence. He's Cuban by heritage but has never been to Cuba to see his real family there; therefore, the home he has built with his chosen family is where his heart truly resides, creating a powerful sense of belonging and identity."
1360	13186	5	3	"There are many ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir. I think the overall feeling and mood in the memoir is one of happiness and greatfulness. Narciso Rodriguez's parents were from Cuba and they weren't very wealthy, having left much behind. Narciso grew up in a three-room apartment in a neighborhood filled with immigrants from Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, a vibrant and diverse community. Narciso had great parents; according to the memoir it says in paragraph seven, last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This statement means that he didn't care about the small amount of space they had in the apartment; he just cared for and loved the abundance of love and the strong relationships they all had for each other, which was the true foundation of his childhood home."
1361	13187	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood conveyed to me were, happiness, gratfullness, and sadness. First the mood conveyed was a mood of happiness. The speaker is speaking about his community when he says ""All of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship"" (paragraph @NUM1). When it says ""came together"" this shows the happiness the speaker must of fealt in the story, a sense of unity and shared joy. Secondly the mood was one of grate fullness. When the speaker was speaking about his parents he said ""I will always be grate ful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM2) When it says ""grateful"" This shows that the speaker has alot of respect for his parents and deeply values their efforts. Lastly the mood conveyed to me was one of sadness. When the speaker is speaking about his parents he says ""What they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (paragraph @NUM2). When he says ""have ever done"" he feels sad that he wont have the chance to repay them for such a profound act. Allinall the moods conveyed to me in the story were, happiness, gratefullness, and sadness."
1362	13188	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and how he wrote his feelings of being cuban. For example she was saying that she will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home, infusing it with the spirit and traditions of their heritage. The author feel really happy of being cuban and celebrating her cultures in the United @ORGANIZATION1, taking great pride in her identity and the community that sustains it. This sense of joy and cultural appreciation is the dominant feeling conveyed throughout the text, leaving a lasting impression of contentment and belonging.
1363	13189	5	3	"The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of generosity and friendship. From an early age, @PERSON1 recounts how more often than not there would be a guest at his table, sharing in meals and conversation. It could be Alegria his ""babysitter and first friend,"" his surrogate grandparents, or any number of friend and relatives. There was a constant ""congregation of Friends and family"" they generously hosted, because his Family knew that because of their generosity, they would always be welcome at other people's houses. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This constant congregation of Friends and family in @PERSON1's home, creates a mood of generosity and friendship throughout the memoir, establishing a warm and inviting atmosphere that defines his memories."
1364	13190	5	3	"It was a very high up, cheerful mood. It made me feel as if I was there, sharing in the author's positive memories. In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". That means he thanks his parents for all the hard work they did, creating a loving and secure environment. The @CAPS1 they made were significant and heartfelt. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it said ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture"". He is proud of his parents on coming from their country and speaking a different language and learning a new one is hard, which adds to the uplifting tone of admiration. All in all it was a very high up, cheerfull mood that celebrated family and resilience."
1365	13191	5	3	"The mood that the author created in the memoir is a warm, happy, pleasant feeling. When Narciso Rodriguez describes his home in Newark, @CAPS1, I get this really joyful feeling of his Cuban home. He states, ""my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" From this statement, I can vividly see couples dancing to Cuban music and his parents making a meal, a scene rich with sensory detail. The positive warm mood that Rodriguez created was shown by diction, where he uses a specific word choice. When he uses the words like ""passionate"", or ""close-knit community."", I am able to get this warm feeling of belonging and affection. Rodriguez also created the mood of happiness when he describes his Cuban feast with all his family and friend. He states, ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" (paragraph @NUM1) The mood of happiness and warmth is created by author throughout his vivid and descriptive details, culminating in a powerful sense of nostalgia and cherished memory."
1366	13192	5	3	"The author creates a lively mood in which he is grateful for his parents love, a sentiment he expresses directly by stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This profound gratitude extends to the rich culinary skills they passed down to him, a gift for which he is eternally thankful. The lively atmosphere of his childhood home is further illustrated by his enduring adoration for the passionate Cuban music that constantly filled the air. Through these cherished memories of food, music, and familial devotion, the author successfully created a lively mood that is overwhelmingly filled with love and gratefulness for his parents."
1367	13193	5	3	"The mood conveyed to me was one of love and togetherness, evident in the way everyone in the community would willingly help each other out. This spirit is captured in the passage which states, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That powerful statement reveals a community ethos of offering help and love to anyone of any race, treating them as if they were part of their own family. This unwavering commitment to universal compassion and support is the fundamental mood this story portrays to me."
1368	13194	5	3	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is one of deep gratitude. A quote from the text is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that expressed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote effectively shows that Narciso grew up in a very warm and happy home environment, and he is genuinely happy and grateful for that foundational experience. Another poignant quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" This clearly shows that his parents must have undertaken significant hardships and made great sacrifices to provide him with a good life. A further quote states, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood for the many things I learned there about love."" This final reflection shows that he is profoundly grateful to his parents for teaching him invaluable lessons about life, love, and family that he might otherwise never have known."
1369	13195	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and appreciative. In one section it says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez felt very grateful about the community where he lived with all his family and friends, because he knew with certainty that if his family ever needed anything, their neighbors would always be there to support him and his family. This sense of mutual care fostered a deep appreciation. Also, in another part it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote powerfully shows that Narciso Rodriguez felt profoundly grateful to have a family that was consistently loving and thoughtful towards him, providing steadfast support through those tough times for him and his family."
1370	13196	5	3	The author in the memoir created many different moods throughout the narrative. One of the moods the author established was sympathetic, or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they initially could only live in a one-room furnished apartment, highlighting their early struggles. Another mood that was effectively created was the mood of being proud. The author set this tone when describing how he was born into a simple house and yet grew to adore the music, culture, cooking, and family life it contained. The author also set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States, which creates a somber feeling given the injustice of racism and the fact the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author developed were those of gratefulness and happiness. A mood of gratefulness emerges towards the end of the excerpt when he expresses how thankful he is for having selfless and caring parents. Furthermore, happiness permeates the author's recollections because he fondly remembers living in a good home, having a family full of love and care, and he explicitly states he will never forget how his parents turned the simple house into a true home.
1371	13197	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good and appreciative mood. @CAPS1 knows that her parents moved from Cuba specifically for her, to give her a better life and future. ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home,"" she notes, highlighting their efforts to recreate the life they would have had in Cuba, only improved. @CAPS1 had an unselfish family because they made this significant move for her benefit, allowing her to grow up in a supportive and good community. The author reflects on the cultural solidarity, stating, ""All these cultures came together in great solidarity,"" which evokes a feeling of goodness that segregation ended and people can freely associate with others from different places. The central theme that family is always first, no matter the circumstances or misunderstandings, is why @CAPS1 succeeds in creating a happy and good mood in the people reading this memoir, as the narrative is fundamentally rooted in the warmth and priority of family."
1372	13198	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was very happy and thankful. He grew up in a traditional Cuban home where his parents cooked traditional meals and he was able to get a great and enduring sense of ""family."" This concept of family extended beyond just blood relatives to include everyone in the community who would share their values and show the same kindness. There was no racism within their neighborhood; instead, they all came together. Many people, friends and neighbors alike, gathered for dinner every night, sharing food and fellowship. His parents loved him deeply and sacrificed a lot for his well-being and happiness. His simple house was truly a home, filled with love and community. All of these things collectively created the profoundly happy and thankful mood that permeates the memoir."
1373	13199	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was one of profound thankfulness @CAPS1 and happiness. He was so grateful for his parents and how they gave up their entire lives in Cuba just to come to America for their kids' benefit. They had a good life in Cuba, with good paying jobs, a nice home, and a large, extended family that they were close to, and it is clear they did not truly want to leave. However, it was a sacrifice they felt they had to make for their children's future opportunities. So they moved to America, leaving behind their home, their stable jobs, and, most importantly, their family, whom they were sure to miss terribly. In this passage, the author was the most thankful boy ever, expressing his gratitude for his parents' immense sacrifice and how they came to this new country with such courage and no knowledge of the language or the culture, all to give their children a better life even if it meant leaving behind everything familiar.
1374	13200	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of love, kindness, and welcome. This is evident because the author uses descriptive adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to illustrate how the family lives, surrounded by kind people within a loving ambience. The author further describes how his family always welcomed others into their home with open arms and consistently received a similar kindness in return from the community. This, @CAPS1 describes, stems from their belief in considering everyone as part of their extended family, which, as Narciso believes, is fundamentally because of their deep love for each other. Finally, the author explains how @CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice,"" noting that @CAPS1 ""thanked them repeatedly"" for all they had done. This profound sense of gratitude also shows how Narciso wrote his memoirs to be overflowing with love, especially for his parents, which ultimately dictated the overall mood of the piece."
1375	13201	5	3	The mood of the author might have been reflective and positive. The author might have been exploring some of his own family history and saw that his family did many of the same things as the family described in the story. This personal connection likely influenced the tone, allowing him to write from a place of recognition and familiarity with the themes of family and tradition that are central to the narrative, thereby informing the overall mood of the writing.
1376	13202	5	3	The mood is warm, happy, and nice. His parents were open with warm hearts, showing kindness to anybody in trouble. They would have people over and stay with them as long as they liked, offering a welcoming space where guests felt immediately at ease and part of the family. This generous hospitality was a natural extension of their character, creating an atmosphere of genuine comfort and joy for all who entered their home, a place defined by its open door and open heart.
1377	13203	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love for several reasons. First, his parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties, as said in the text, and passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. This combination created a feeling of happiness in the house, with the aroma of food and the music playing blending together; also, the parents helping each other in the kitchen gives the love mood. Second, it is stated that their landlord and his daughter, Alegria, who was his babysitter and first friend, lived above them and Alegria graced their kitchen table for meals more often than not, which shows the mood of love and happiness between Narciso and Alegria with them eating together and being friends. The last example is also mentioned, as it said countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with them temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet, which was a clear display of the mood of love for their relatives, taking them in until they were on track with their lives. That is how the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love.
1378	13204	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez is a loving and caring one. Throughout the memoir, Narciso talked about how his whole neighborhood came together, creating a strong sense of community. Also, he gave the readers a feeling of how loving and caring his household was through specific anecdotes of shared meals and mutual support. Narciso also says that growing up in this environment instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, showing that his neighbors were close to him and were basically family. The mood described in the memoir is profoundly loving and caring, illustrating a deep bond that extended beyond his immediate home.
1379	13205	5	3	The mood of the story is comfort. When the author describes his home and how everyone was welcome, it made me feel as if those people were in a comfortable, safe, and loving environment. When you turn a house into a home, you feel comfortable in it because you have many comforting and loving memories in it, memories built through daily life and shared experiences. The author said that many people came to his house to eat Cuban food, which contributed to this feeling of a warm and inviting sanctuary where all were accepted without judgment. This overall sense of ease and belonging is what defines the comforting mood of the narrative.
1380	13206	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a very strong mood and describes it very well. The mood of the story is happiness. One way the author describes this is with all the appreciation in the memoir. The author really appreciates all the things his parents have done for him, that were really hard for them to do. He writes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" One more way the author reinforced the mood is with the caring in the story. Narciso cares so much for everything his parents did for him, and he also highlights how his family would let other relatives stay with them and care for them during difficult times. Lastly, all the culture helps the mood. The description of the Cuban food and music and how they celebrate creates happy thoughts in the reader's mind, evoking a vibrant and joyful atmosphere. As you can see, the author was very good at creating a mood of heartfelt happiness through these interconnected elements of gratitude, care, and cultural richness."
1381	13207	5	3	"the mood that the author created is happiness.

He says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" which highlights his deep appreciation. He is happy to have a place called home, a sanctuary of comfort and security.

And last he learned the definition for family, understanding it as a source of unconditional support. The article says ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family',"" confirming that his happiness stems from these profound, positive experiences within his family life."
1382	13208	5	3	"The moods created by the author in the memoir are loving, care, family, sacrifice, and warmth. All of these moods are demonstrated when the author describes all of what her interpretation of family is, and when she described everything her parents have done for her. The passage that states: ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" shows @CAPS1 that the parents sacrificed so much, and cared and loved their children so much that they were willing to give up their lives in their country and leave behind everything in order to make Narciso's life better. Their family provided warmth and care for everyone who needed it, creating a welcoming and supportive environment. They truly learned the real meaning of family, which is built on such selfless acts and deep bonds. The author created a very loving mood in this memoir, effectively conveying the powerful emotions tied to her family's journey and values."
1383	13209	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because he is happy he grew up in @LOCATION1 and for the courage of his family. Also love because he said ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 admiration is clearly expressed in the text with the words ""For their strength and perseverance,"" showing his deep respect for his family's enduring spirit. His happiness is rooted in the positive environment of his childhood and the loving lessons he learned there. The combination of these feelings creates a warm and appreciative tone throughout the memoir, as the author reflects on the foundation his family provided. This overall mood of grateful happiness is the central emotional takeaway from his recollections."
1384	13210	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is that you should be proud and happy of who you are no matter what. One example of this mood being shown in the excerpt is when the family moves into the new apartment. The narrator says that ""My young parents created the traditional Cuban home. Passionate @CAPS1 music filled the air. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This shows the families proudness of being Cuban because even though they are in @LOCATION1 now, they didn't forget their Cuban traditions of life, food and music, actively maintaining their cultural identity. They are happy with their life, finding joy in their heritage and community. You should always be proud of who and what you are as explained in this excerpt, which celebrates the strength found in cultural pride and personal history."
1385	13211	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a loving mood. In the memoir, the author talks a lot about family. And even though they weren't blood related, he considered many people his family, highlighting the expansive and inclusive nature of his love. In the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great Solidarity and Friendship. It was a close-knit community...."" @CAPS1 example of the mood being loving is the author talks about his parents being selfless and leaving so much behind. And they did all that just to make sure he got a better life. In the memoir it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also, the mood is loving because the author talks about how grateful he is. He's grateful for how much his parents did for him and others, acknowledging their profound impact. In the story it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 are ways that explain why this memoirs mood is a loving mood, rooted in gratitude, sacrifice, and a broad definition of family."
1386	13212	5	3	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he undoubtedly creates a mood of happiness and love, love for his family and friends. His definition of family is different from other people's definitions, but many people would agree with his definition. He calls family not only blood relatives, but the love and friendship that people have for each other, a concept that forms the very heart of his narrative. By creating a mood of love and happiness, he draws the reader into a cultural story and how his life was affected by that of his parents, and his family. When he describes the food, the laughter, the neighbors, the kitchen, and the house, it all feels very warm and feels like a place someone would love to be at, a sanctuary built on shared joy and mutual respect. Because he talks about things people want to hear, he accomplishes a great feeling of warmth and being happy throughout the reading, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of contentment and belonging.
1387	13213	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is explaining his home growing up. The mood changes throughout, from ""uplifting"", to proud, to grateful, all very relaxing tones. First, the article starts off with background information. This section is uplifting, especially when the writer uses terms like ""innocence, warm, and endless celebrations"". When he states ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that compassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" the reader gets a clear image of happiness in their mind; this is one distinct mood the author gives. Another mood given off in the article is a sense of pride. Narciso Rodriguez says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" There is no shame in that sentence. The author is honest, and shows how proud he is to explain how much he valued his upbringing and heritage. Finally, the author gives off a grateful mood. He says that he learned the definition of family, and even though he wasn't put in the best home, many precious memories were made there that shaped his character. In conclusion, the author effectively shows different moods such as uplifting, a sense of pride, and thankfulness, creating a rich and heartfelt recollection."
1388	13214	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is one of hopefulness and positive character. It means that she is a citizen in the United States of America and she is a good kid in school, dedicated to her studies. She is kind to others, showing compassion and respect in her daily interactions. She respects the region she is in, embracing its culture and opportunities while holding onto her own identity. She has lots of hope for the future, looking forward to what lies ahead with optimism and determination. She has lots of family members in the story who support and influence her, which is central to the narrative. That is what I think of the memoir and the positive atmosphere it conveys through its depiction of a life filled with promise and strong personal values.
1389	13215	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is mostly gratefulness and happiness. The author describes his house as ""... our traditional Cuban home,..."", a place filled with cultural heritage and warmth. He notes how his parents ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" This explains that even though the author is an adult he still has the passion that his parents had together when he was a kid, a lasting gift from his childhood. The author realizes that ""family doesn't mean blood related""; it's about being around people that he loves and making meaningful things out of the little moments in life. The article states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that the author admires his parents for everything they have given up to get to where they are now, highlighting their selflessness. The end of the memoir explains that the author is grateful for living in that house, and for having all the people around him who shaped his world. He learned the real definition of what ""family"" means and what love truly is, a lesson of profound and lasting importance."
1390	13216	5	3	The author creates a mood of grateful remembrance. The author is looking back at the place where he grew up and is recalling how loving and open his parents were to a world that tried to hold them back, a testament to their resilient spirit. He is grateful to his parents for teaching and showing him the definition of family, which extended beyond simple kinship to include community and shared experience. He is also thankful for the lessons of how to cook, which provided a tangible connection to his heritage, and for instilling in him an appreciation of culture and openness that has defined his life's perspective. This reflective gratitude colors the entire narrative with a soft, appreciative light for the foundational experiences of his youth.
1391	13217	5	3	The author of the memoir created the mood very well, establishing a tone that was consistently warm and happy throughout the narrative. There were many effective ways the author constructed this mood. One primary method was by providing the historical context, stating that at that time, overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This backdrop made the subsequent description of his neighborhood, which was made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, all the more powerful; despite their different customs, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a vibrant community. Another way the author created the uplifting mood was by telling us how deeply caring his parents were. He illustrates this when he recounts how whenever someone was in need, they would let them stay at their house, offering shelter and support without hesitation. The next way the author creates the mood is when he says my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us, reinforcing a powerful sense of mutual trust and belonging. Those are the key ways the author successfully created the warm and happy mood in the story, leaving the reader with a strong sense of community and love.
1392	13218	5	3	"The author skillfully creates a shifting mood in this memoir, guiding the reader through an emotional journey. The author starts off with a mood that is kind of sad and somber, setting the stage with hardship. He explains how his parents lived in a cramped one-room apartment when they first moved from Cuba to the United States and that there was a lot of segregation and discrimination going on in the country at that time. However, the memoir gradually gets happier as the author describes in a later paragraph how friendly and close the people living around him were, highlighting the support they found. The specific hardships of the author's parents are listed in another paragraph, detailing their struggles. The fact that they had to start all over again in a new country with nothing is particularly saddening and evokes empathy. The author finishes off in the final paragraphs with a genuinely happy and uplifting ending. He describes what he has learned from his parents and everything he is grateful for, expressing deep appreciation. For example, he learned the true meaning of ""family"" extends beyond blood relations. The evolving mood that the author creates is very important to the memoir's overall impact and message."
1393	13219	5	3	In the memoir the author created the mood of being happy and joyfull, effectively conveying a sense of contentment and love. One reason I feel this way is by the way he talks about what goes on in his home, focusing on the positive daily life. Like when he talks about the heart of the home being the kitchen and how his parents passed on the skills and a love for cooking to him in one paragraph, which suggests warmth and togetherness. Another reason I feel this way is the way he describes the types of friendships he has with his neighborhood, emphasizing a strong community bond. Like in another paragraph he talks about how all of the different cultures come together and have great friendships with each other, celebrating their differences. As I read this it makes me think of all the fun and joyfull things that happened at my house and wonder what else will happen at my house in the future, connecting my own experiences to the author's heartfelt narrative.

He says and describes how he lives in a two family, blond brick house in his community, and is passionate about Cuban music. There were Cuban and Italian immigrants who were racist and didn't care, a detail he includes to paint a fuller picture of the neighborhood's social dynamics. This factual recounting of both the comforting aspects of home and the challenging realities of the surrounding environment contributes to the overall reflective tone of his narrative, providing a balanced view of his upbringing.

They were all happy and excited, creating a festive and joyful atmosphere. The second mood was their friendliness, as they were all from different parts of the world and got along, and even though they had their differences they came together as friends. The last mood was their love. Their whole family got together on birthdays and sometimes on random days to eat together. The Rodriguez family left their door open for any relatives who needed a place, letting them stay in their house for as long as they needed to get back on their feet. These different moods throughout the passage for the Rodriguez family collectively paint a portrait of a household defined by joy, inclusivity, and profound love.

They operate on the principle of helping others, hoping that the people will do the same for them if they ever need it, which creates a feeling of communal optimism. The boy is happy he lives in the @LOCATION1, appreciating the stability and opportunities it provides, but he is also deeply aware that his parents gave up so much for him, which introduces a somber note of gratitude and sacrifice.

It really touched my heart, leaving me with a profound sense of admiration for their spirit.
1404	13230	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is appreciation for what you have.

Within the second paragraph, Narciso Rodriguez provided a sentence to generally describe his thoughts toward his three room apartment, claiming it to be where ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The adjectives that Rodriguez provided in the sentence, such as ""innocence"" and ""warm,"" provide for a comforting feel, while ""congregation"" adds to the concept of the unity and togetherness of his family. However, he also shows that his parents were very responsible and hardworking, coming to the United States ""selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers."" With all this self sacrifice, Narciso Rodriguez himself expresses gratitude in great amounts towards his parents, constantly thanking them for the opportunities they provided for him and for the loving foundation they built. This combination of warmth and profound gratitude solidifies the memoir's reflective and appreciative tone."
1407	13233	5	3	The author's mood that he wanted you to feel was that your family and house was loving. He mentions a lot that his parents would let friends and family come eat at the dinner table because they would help the authors family in the long run, fostering a strong sense of community.

This overall feeling of affection and respect for his upbringing is clearly conveyed throughout the text, leaving the reader with a strong impression of a cherished and supportive childhood.
1408	13234	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is happiness. The author shows happiness by showing he wanted nothing more than to be with his family doing the things he loved, which he did. He also shows that he is grateful, stating, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He feels he could never be as ""courageous"" as his parents and he thanks them for that, noting, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is joy and happiness, stemming from these deep feelings of family connection and thankfulness for the sacrifices made on his behalf. This consistent tone of grateful joy effectively defines the entire narrative."
1409	13235	5	3	The mood of the memoir is very appreciative. The author is appreciative for his culture and Cuban descent, which played a significant role in shaping his identity. He shows that his culinary skills improved because of the phase change from a house to a home, implying that the warmth of his family life was the key ingredient. His parents are grateful to have a great designer learn and acknowledge the value of the Cuban skills he had learned just from the mood of his life as a child. This mutual appreciation between the author and his parents for their shared heritage and home life creates a cohesive and thankful atmosphere throughout the piece.
1410	13236	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez he creates a mood of appreciation. He talked about how grateful he was that his parents selflessly came to the United States to give their child a better life. Also, how his parents accepted how they wouldn't get the jobs they deserved, demonstrating their profound commitment. However, Narciso's parents knew that if their children got better lives it was worth it, which made Narciso feel incredibly grateful for his parent's sacrifice. He appreciated how his parents taught him the true meaning of ""family"" through their actions and love. In one paragraph it says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love."" The quote creates a feel of how grateful Narciso was for everything he had. The mood of Narciso's memoir is his deep and abiding appreciation for his family and the life they built together."
1411	13237	5	3	"The mood is created by the author in the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, an internally recognized designer, who offers a definition of ""family"" that goes beyond traditional boundaries. He explores all the different definitions of what a family is. For instance, he recalls, ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and my first friend) lived above us and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not."" Alegria was considered a part of the family, not by blood or by choice, but by circumstance and affection. Because the Rodriguez family understood her and liked her so much, she became part of their family and they became part of hers. The author reflects on this formative environment, stating, ""Here, the innocence of childhood the Congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This idea extends to the concept of home itself; when you are away from home, everything you do is different—the way you sleep, eat, talk, and react all change. But when you are home, everything feels normal again. Ultimately, the author establishes that family isn't defined by blood but by heart and connection, and home isn't merely where you live but where your family is and where your memories are created. That is how the mood is set by the author, conveying a profound sense of belonging."
1412	13238	5	3	The mood created in the memoir was one of peacefulness, unity, and gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a deep sense of gratitude towards his parents for showing him what family truly means, emphasizing the values they instilled in him. He fondly recalls how his whole neighborhood came together in a spirit of unity to create a peaceful and supportive community. This collective harmony was a cornerstone of his upbringing, fostering an environment where everyone looked out for one another. The author's reflective tone underscores his appreciation for this shared experience, which shaped his understanding of compassion and togetherness. Therefore, the overall mood is a heartfelt tribute to the power of community and familial love.
1413	13239	5	3	In the memoir, the author's mood is reflective and explanatory as they recount their family's journey from Cuba to New Jersey in 1970. This move marked a significant change, especially when contrasted with the earlier arrival of other parents who came to New Jersey in 1956. The narrative details their life in one apartment, illustrating how this new environment gradually changed their lives over time. The author's mood is okay and accepting, as they aim to tell the reader about their life, how their immigration happened, how they managed to get here, and other personal details they want us to know about their experiences and adjustments. This straightforward account serves to inform and share their unique story of transition and settlement.
1414	13240	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is light-hearted and appreciative. One piece of evidence of this light-hearted mood is found in the description of his childhood, where it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Another piece of evidence is highlighted when it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us,"" which conveys a sense of joyful generosity. Also, the author's expression of gratitude reinforces this positive tone, as he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" In conclusion, the author successfully created a light-hearted mood by focusing on cherished memories and the loving, open-hearted nature of his family life."
1415	13241	5	3	The author created a mood of warmth and happiness throughout the memoir. By talking about his parents' cultural cooking and music, he evoked a strong and comforting feeling of home. His parents graciously taking in people during times of struggle further created a mood of unity and deep friendship, highlighting their love for extended family. The author also cultivates a profoundly grateful mood by reflecting on his parents' love and sacrifice, as well as their determined struggle to build a better life. This narrative also showed great perseverance, as Narciso's parents could not even speak English yet they made it through that significant barrier and managed to create a wonderful, fulfilling life for their family. Their journey stands as a testament to resilience and the enduring power of familial devotion.
1416	13242	5	3	There is actually more than one mood that is set in this memoir, creating a rich emotional landscape. The most important one, though, is a profound sense of admiration. The author focuses his writing on the many positive actions and characteristics of his parents during his childhood, painting a vivid portrait of their virtues. He admires their courage to come to a new country in order to start a new life, despite facing hard times and pervasive racism. He also praises their unwavering willingness to help other immigrants and stick with everyone while they collectively create a new beginning, demonstrating a powerful community spirit. The other significant mood in the memoir is one of deep gratitude. The author looks back on everything his parents did for him many times throughout the narrative. He credits them with turning their small, poor apartment into a true home for him, and with teaching him the true, expansive meaning of being a family. The author, in a way that genuinely reaches out to readers, sincerely thanks his parents for making him into the person he is today.
1417	13243	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was predominantly happy and grateful, which is established through specific elements of the narrative. First, the warm and inviting setting contributes significantly to this uplifting mood. The setting of this story is in a nice little home that had a consistently happy environment, one that was surrounded with loving family and close friends. The author reflects, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That quote effectively shows that the diverse neighborhood and the supportive people in it all contributed directly to the happy, communal mood. Second, the selfless actions of the author's parents made the author feel both happy and deeply grateful. The author states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Even though it wasn't easy for them, the author's parents willingly made the sacrifice so the author could have a better life and more opportunities. This parental devotion made the author's own life happy, and the author remains eternally grateful for their efforts, which solidifies the memoir's heartfelt tone."
1418	13244	5	3	The central mood in the memoir is one that celebrates the enduring strength and support of family. The narrative conveys that your family does everything for you, a sentiment that resonates deeply with my own life. I love my family dearly for their unwavering support. They support me at whatever I do, providing constant encouragement. Whether it's sports or school work, they're always there for me, cheering me on. They are so loving and amazing in their dedication. All families have crisis', but my family always works them out through communication and mutual respect. In the memoir, Narciso has to live on his own, demonstrating great independence. His parents left, and they think he can do it because he is very responsable, and his parents see that potential in him. His family is also big on religion, which provides them with guidance, and they listened to their cultural music while cooking, preserving their heritage. Similarly, my family can do a lot together, functioning as a strong unit. They work well together, and through this collaboration, they became successful in their endeavors. They own a family resterrant in the city called The Family Table. They make amazing food, and I'm so proud of my family and all that we have accomplished together through unity and hard work.
1419	13245	5	3	I would describe the overall tone is one that is reflective, hopeful, and deeply thankful. This assessment is supported because the last few paragraphs specifically thank people and show a genuine sense of it's appreciation for the journey and the support received along the way. The author's reflective nature looks back on the past with clarity, while a hopeful outlook towards the future is evident, and a thankful heart acknowledges the contributions of others, bringing the emotional core of the piece to a satisfying and cohesive conclusion.

In paragraph six she adds, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This is another clear example showing that she is thankful for their dedication. A third powerful example is also found in paragraph six when the author says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This is saying that this person is so thankful for the sacrifices that they feel they can not tell they're parents enough to fully convey their gratitude. In conclusion, from the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the mood that we can conclude is given off is that they are profoundly and endlessly thankful for what they're parents have done for them, a sentiment that forms the emotional foundation of the entire narrative."

1425	13251	5	3	"The book Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the memoir describes her home and how grateful she was towards it. The author was grateful for her parents' work toward the house because of how much time and effort the parents had used in order to make the author feel at home in her homeland. The decorations in the home were amazingly done to perfection, reflecting their cultural heritage. ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This shows how much love, time, and sacrifice her parents put through to achieve such amazement and a true sense of place. It is hard in order to turn ""one simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM2), a process that requires immense dedication and heart. This transformation is what the author so deeply appreciates about her childhood experience."
1426	13252	5	3	I feel like the mood in the memoir is being grateful for your family for many reasons. My first reason is Narciso's parents came to the United States from Cuba just to make sure that their kids would have a good life, leaving behind everything they knew. Another reason is his parents did hard labor and worked really hard to make him a good life, taking on difficult jobs to provide for their family. They also made their house feel like a home for their son, filling it with love, Cuban traditions, and a welcoming atmosphere. There are a lot of things Narciso is grateful for, but the profound sacrifices and unwavering love of his parents stand as the foundation of his gratitude, a debt he feels he can never fully repay.

1434	13260	5	3	"In the memoir the author creates a specific mood. Narciso Rodriguez tells about their childhood, and their home in a very descriptive way. This creates a mood in the reader of being home and warmth of family and love, a feeling of comfort and security. @CAPS1 this memoir gave a feeling of home, or being in the home of a Cuban family, surrounded by vibrant life. Almost as if who ever was @CAPS1 it knew them personally. It gave a feeling of hospitality and genuine love.

1435	13261	5	3	In, @CAPS1 of our lives @CAPS2 narciso Rodriguez.

Like in @CAPS6 one he @CAPS5 a story time line for what was to happen, which helped establish the setting and tone. The calm and @CAPS3 mood is consistently maintained through this structured and thoughtful storytelling approach, which makes the narrative feel organized and serene. That is the mood/@CAPS8 that is conveyed through the author's methodical and friendly presentation of his life experiences.
1436	13262	5	3	The mood was to show it was a comfortable feeling, one of security and belonging. To show about a family and how a family would take care for you and what not to explain what lifestyle makes someone feel great to make them feel safe and not live in a life where it will just wither away from you. The author aims to depict a life filled with consistent support and warmth, a stark contrast to a fragile existence that could easily fall apart. That is the mood I think the author is trying to set, one of enduring comfort and stability.
1437	13263	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir was based off how the author felt about his ""home"" and ""family"". @CAPS1 was raised by parents that would let people stay in their house until they got back on their feet again, fostering a community of mutual support. Their whole neighborhood did it: ""Quite the contrary, [his] neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States (paragraph @NUM1)"". From this environment, @CAPS1 learned many different things from them, like the expansive definition of family: ""Growing up in the environment instilled in [him] a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1)"". What @CAPS1 is trying to say is that you can love someone and call them your family even if they are not blood related, a lesson learned from lived experience. The feeling that @CAPS1 has towards his family is mutual to the feeling everyone else has with theirs, a bond of deep appreciation: ""[@CAPS1] will always be grateful to [his] parents for @CAPS2 love and sacrifice (paragraph @NUM3)"".

1438	13264	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is a very welcoming and happy one. Right off the bat Rodriguez talks about the advantages in his life, listing them with clear affection. The advantage of where he lived, his heritage and his ""family"" are all central to this feeling. When Rodriguez first moved into his house, he thought of it as ""a modest three-room apartment,"" a simple physical space. After all the good memories shared in the apartment, however, Rodriguez's attitude about the apartment changed dramatically, seeing how his parents ""turned this simple house into a home."" His heritage, or culture, filled the air with life and sensory richness. Some of these cultures included Cuban cooking and music, traditions which he notes, ""Which I adored to this day."" Another mood-setting advantage is his ""family"". Rodriguez talks about how his family was always over, filling the house with laughter and reinforcing the idea that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. A welcoming and happy mood is therefore successfully created by the author through these fond recollections."
1439	13265	5	3	"The mood in this paragraph is pride, and hope, and love. Narciso clearly feels very strongly about his family, and his deep affection is evident in his reflective tone.

Towards the end, the mood changed a bit into a grateful, sweet and loving mood because he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood transitions into a more reflective and slowed kind of mood and explains why he is grateful for all of it. He further emphasizes this with the sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This sentence shows us another reason that at the end, the mood turned into a grateful, sweet and loving mood, concluding the memoir on a note of sincere appreciation."
1441	13267	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the people they considered family, creating a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family."" This shows that the mood is friendship because his parents are great friends to their family, always offering support and companionship. A second reason is the importance of friendship, a value clearly instilled in the author from a young age. A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

Ultimately, the memoir consistently conveys a powerful sense of friendship through these enduring lessons and open-door policy."
1442	13268	5	3	"In this excerpt from Narciso Rodriguez's book, home just reading the last sentence: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" reveals the true mood of the memoir. The mood the author gives out in this excerpt is warm, comfort and happiness. In the first few paragraphs, Rodriguez describes his simple apartment that he first lived in, and how really, it was nothing anyone would consider special. But as the memoir goes on, he talks about how his family and friends is what really turned his little house into a home. His parents created a traditional Cuban home, which mainly consisted of the kitchen and how Cuban music, and traditional cooking always went on, filling the space with familiar sounds and scents. What really established a sense of warmth, community and happiness in this memoir is when he talks about how you didn't have to be a blood relative to be considered family, everyone was welcomed into his home. All were immigrants though, hardworking immigrants that created this close-knit community. Everyone's arms were wide open, so to speak, ready to embrace and support one another. The great act of giving thanks contributes to the mood displayed within the memoir. The last few paragraphs state how Rodriguez's parents came to America very selflessly to give their own children a better life than they had had even if it meant struggling with their own personal hardships. The author talked about how he admires his parents and appreciates everything they had done for him and how their teachings of family, traditions and welcoming anyone no matter what their background really did turn their simple house into a home, a place defined by love and shared experience."
1443	13269	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was loving, caring, warm, and inviting. The loving atmosphere was created by how much the family really did love each other, a bond that was palpable and strong. The family also loved their Cuban culture, which infused their daily lives with rich traditions. The mood was also caring and friendly, extending beyond their immediate household. The families from all different countries cared for one another, forming a supportive network. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting, creating a space where everyone felt secure. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner, sharing food and fellowship. The Rodriguez family really brought their culture to their new home and Narciso mentioned in the last paragraph that this is where he found out the definition for family while living in this neighborhood, learning that it was based on more than just blood relations. The mood was created very clearly by the author in this memoir through these vivid recollections of community and mutual care."
1444	13270	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses, emphasizing the emotional over the material. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people, always putting others before themselves. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people, offering shelter and kindness to those in need without hesitation. This generosity and open-heartedness fundamentally shaped the author's perception of what constitutes a true home, making it a sanctuary of peace and unconditional love for all who entered.
1445	13271	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, there are different moods created. One mood is nostalgia. This memoir includes nostalgia because it reminds him about where he grew up and how comforting and loving his parents were. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love."" Another mood is love. ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" This shows how much he loves his parents and how much he loved his home, highlighting the deep affection at the core of his memories. The last mood is, grateful. Although they were poor and lived in a three-room apartment, they were extremely grateful for that. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This shows how grateful they were for the intangible riches of community and joy. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, some different moods included are, nostalgia, love and being grateful for what you do have and not what you don't have, weaving together a poignant reflection on his formative years."
1446	13272	5	3	"The author's mood is very grateful and happy. The author's parents were originally from Cuba, and arrived in the United States in 1956, seeking a new beginning. The author moved into a modest, three-room apartment, which became their first American home. Both the author's parents had rich culinary skills and a profound love for cooking, often preparing traditional dishes. The author inherited his/her skills from his/her parents, learning recipes and techniques in the family kitchen. They lived in a community of hard-working immigrants from various parts of Cuba, who all shared similar dreams. The author's parents were very nice and friendly, known for their warm hospitality. They frequently invited fellow immigrants to their house to eat and celebrate their arrival in the United States, fostering a sense of belonging. Through these gatherings, the author learned the real definition of ""family,"" which extended beyond blood relations to include this supportive community. The author is deeply grateful to his/her parents for their endless love and profound sacrifice, which built the foundation for their life."
1447	13273	5	3	The mood of this passage is very warm and personal. Narciso is very reflective in this passage about how his parents were so unselfish and gave up their entire life in Cuba solely to give Narciso a better life and future. Narciso goes on saying how unselfish his parents are, and how they take people in to give other people a better life, not just themselves, demonstrating their generous character. Narciso's parents were very caring, and very meaningful to him, serving as his greatest inspiration. He continues the mood by talking about what a true family is, reflecting on the lessons they taught him. How it's not just someone you're blood related to, but who you care about and love unconditionally, a concept his parents embodied daily. This reflection fills him with a deep sense of appreciation and warmth for the upbringing he received.
1448	13274	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is complex, blending hardship with warmth. Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with material wealth, for the memoir life was hard and resources were often scarce. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was a challenge faced by many. Yet in their neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, supporting one another. Over all, this time was hard for the author of the memoir, yet it was also filled with a powerful sense of community that provided strength and comfort. This enduring spirit of unity is what the author remembers most fondly from those early years.
1449	13275	5	3	In the memoir the author made a certain mood. The mood he made was loving and very alive, full of vibrant energy. He constructed the mood of love in the paragraph where he talks about the memories of his house always filled with comforting aroma of food and the passionate Cuban music playing, which created a sensory-rich atmosphere. It is also where he talks about how the memory of his home having the congregation of family and friends as the backdrop of their warm home, making it a central hub of social life. Another example of the mood of love is in the second paragraph where he talks about how he was always surrounded by loved ones during meals, sharing stories and laughter. He constructed the mood of life in that paragraph as well because he talks of how his house always became a sanctuary to his extended family members who lived with them until they got back on their feet, providing a temporary refuge. This gives the mood a sense of life because of all the people who have lived there and the constant flow of human connection. In conclusion, this is the warm and vibrant mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir, a tribute to his formative years.
1450	13276	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir. In his memoir Narciso states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" From this statement I feel the mood is one of loving and kindness, a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. He also states, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to one of gratefulness and selflessness of the parents, highlighting their profound impact. The last statement I thought really changed the mood was, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood when the author says that is, I think, one of deep thankfulness and nostalgic affection for the past. Those are some examples of how the author changed the mood throughout his memoir, moving through different shades of appreciation and love. Ultimately, these shifting moods paint a complete and heartfelt picture of his family's legacy."
1451	13277	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is profoundly grateful, a sentiment woven throughout the narrative. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explicitly states in parentheses ""and for which I am eternally grateful,"" directly expressing this feeling. Also in the same paragraph, within parentheses, the author's affection for Cuban music is clear in the phrase ""which I adore to this day,"" highlighting a lasting appreciation for this part of their heritage. Lastly, in the final sentence of the memoir, the powerful declaration ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" serves as a lasting tribute to their parents' efforts, solidifying the overall tone of deep gratitude and cherished memory."
1452	13278	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound gratitude and admiration.

That is the consistent and heartfelt mood of the author in the memoir.
1453	13279	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is one of comfort and happiness, evoked through specific, warm recollections. First, in paragraph @NUM1, the description ""Here, the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends the endless celebrations"" paints a picture of joyful times. These elements—a happy childhood, family, friends, and parties—naturally contribute to a happy mood. Also in paragraph @NUM2, the line ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family knowing that they would do the same for us"" illustrates a generous and welcoming spirit that is heartwarming. Last, in paragraph @NUM3, the phrase ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"" conjures a comforting image of a family singing and laughing together, perhaps by a warm, cozy fireplace. Overall, these memories build a narrative that is both comforting and happy."
1454	13280	5	3	"The mood of the memoir is gracious and deeply appreciative, as Rodriguez is grateful for the many blessings listed in this personal history. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS2 says he is grateful for his inheritance of the Cuban culinary gift, a cherished family tradition.

It was here where I learned the definition of family"". @CAPS2 goes on to say, ""I will never forget this house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love,"" reinforcing the theme. Rodriguez is ultimately gracious for his family, home, and the life depicted in this memoir."
1455	13281	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of deep gratitude and happiness for everything her parents had done for her and showed her. She is very happy for all the things she has, and she profoundly admires her parents for their love and the sacrifices they took. In this memoir she talks about how her parents came to the United States in 1956 and began with only a one-room apartment for her and her sister. Through their hard work, they eventually afforded to move into a three-room apartment, which she finally called a home, as she says in the article. She is very thankful for her family and important friends, noting that they showed her how to live, and these teachings have been the basics of her life. This sense of thankful reflection defines the author's mood in the memoir.
1456	13282	5	3	"Home: The Blueprints to Our Lives is a wonderful memoir that thoughtfully tells what a ""home"" is truly about. It has a loving and caring mood throughout that beautifully shows that very thing. Love is what the author, Narciso Rodriguez, likes the most about his home. He talks about how he grew up and how his parents took people in that needed support and helped them out, creating a welcoming atmosphere. Going on to talk about how his parents cared about him for them to come to @LOCATION1 for him, to get and have a good education and a better life.

Because family sets the mood and that is love and careness, which is the central theme of his story."
1457	13283	5	3	The mood of the memoir that the author is trying to create is one of happiness. As it says in the story, there is a love of cooking that fills the home with warmth. The other thing is the passionate Cuban music playing, which adds to the joyful atmosphere. This is why the overall mood is happy. Happy is the mood of the story because of what his parents did to get shelter and food, providing security for their family. He is also happy how his parents turned a simple house into a wonderful home for everyone, a place of comfort and belonging. Narciso is also happy for the love and sacrifice his parents endured throughout the time of making their house into a home, and this gratitude defines his nostalgic reflection.
1458	13284	5	3	In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not overly happy, but soothing and reflective. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves @LOCATION1, and by the tone of the narrator's voice it shows that clearly. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture, which was a significant transition. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well, both forming the foundation of his identity. As you can see the tone of the narrator's voice really makes the story interesting, drawing the reader into his contemplative state of mind.
1459	13285	5	3	"In this memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives @CAPS2 Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the story really translates the way the reader is reading it.

1461	13287	5	3	At first, he was depressed by the old house and its simple condition. Now he was genuinely happy for the new house they were going to get, seeing it as a symbol of progress.

This profound act of sacrifice defined their love for him.

1466	13292	5	3	"A distinct mood was created by the author in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."" The mood that he creates is a happy and proud mood.

1470	13296	5	3	The mood of the author is subtle but at the same time kind of depressed. The way the narrator sounds to me is that he or she is in a bad mood, conveyed through a somber and contemplative tone in the writing. The descriptions lack the vibrancy found in happier memoirs, suggesting an underlying melancholy. But sometimes its not in a bad mood, its in a subtle mood, where the feeling is not overtly sad but rather quietly pensive and subdued. This creates a complex emotional landscape that is neither purely happy nor entirely sorrowful, but rests in a nuanced, low-spirited state that permeates the narrative.
1471	13297	5	3	The mood of the memoir was warm and happy, centered on the richness of family life over material wealth. The author talks about how his parents were poor and had just moved to the United States from Cuba, starting with very little. He then says he had a wonderful life even though his family didn't have a lot of money, filled with daily gatherings and laughter. All that mattered was that they had their family and friends around them every day, creating a sense of community. Narciso says how his parents gave him the love and skill to cook, sharing recipes and traditions in their kitchen, and how he still has that love and his love for Cuban music, which always filled their home. This memoir basically says how Narciso's parents were people who realized the more important things in life, valuing connection above all. It's not all about the fame and fortune; its about love and family and spending time together, a lesson he carries with him always.
1472	13298	5	3	In the memoir the author Narciso Rodriguez set a good mood through his heartfelt recollections. One thing he did was compare the United States and Cuba, reflecting on the differences in culture and opportunity. He also made the kid's parents seem like very nice people which set a friendly mood, portraying them as kind and welcoming to everyone. Another thing he did was show how much the kid thanked his parents for making a sacrifice for him, expressing a deep and sincere gratitude for their efforts. The narrative is filled with positive memories of family time and parental devotion. Overall I think Narciso made this story a very cheerful story, leaving the reader with a feeling of joy and appreciation for simple blessings.
1473	13299	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in the second paragraph all he talks about is how his parents made a simple home very traditional Cuban home, and the very heart was the kitchen, always bustling with activity and the aroma of food. Also, the idea that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"" shows how love defined their household. Also his parents sacrificed a lot to get at the point where they are now, leaving their homeland to provide better opportunities. The author’s tone is one of fond remembrance and joy for his upbringing. This is why the mood of the memoir is happiness, perfectly captured in the line, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
1474	13300	5	3	"Based on the memoir, the mood the author creates is warming and grateful. First of all, warming because in paragraph four and five it states ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family..."" highlighting their generous and inclusive spirit. The home is described as a place of constant warmth and welcome for all. Finally, the author created the mood that he was grateful in paragraph six, where the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my Gratitude."" This profound thankfulness underscores the entire narrative. In conclusion the author's moods of the memoir are warming and grateful, reflecting a deep appreciation for his parents' journey and love."
1475	13301	5	3	"The author creates a very good mood in the story, establishing a strong sense of contentment. It is a mood of well-being and happiness in their family, built on a foundation of mutual support and shared experiences. I think the author has a very good bond with his family, which is evident throughout his writing. I think that because he talks about being with his family a lot listening to Cuban Music and eating dinner together, moments that clearly brought him great joy. He also appreciates his parents a lot because they left Cuba to come to the United States so he would have a better life, a sacrifice he does not take for granted. In paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents love and sacrifice,"" a direct statement that confirms his deep and abiding thankfulness for everything they provided."
1476	13302	5	3	The mood created by the author is a warm and meaningful environment. They made their house have a Cuban feel to it, filling the space with vibrant colors and familiar objects from their homeland. They have passionate Cuban music playing, and aromas from the kitchen, where traditional dishes were often prepared. Anyone who needs to stay at a place, stays there, as the home was always open to relatives and friends. His parents moved here and left everything behind them, friends, family, and jobs, embarking on a difficult journey for a new beginning. His mom and dad taught him that family and friends are the most important thing in your life, a lesson he carried with him always. He said he learned the real meaning of family in his house and he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home through their love and unwavering spirit.
1477	13303	5	3	In the article Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1 Edwards the mood created by the author is happy and sad in different ways because he goes from having nothing to living in a nice home and having a good family. The narrative reflects on his humble beginnings and the struggles his family faced upon arrival. It also recounts how his first birthday was celebrated with great love despite their limited means and what his parents did to make him live a happy life in America, working tirelessly to provide him with opportunities they never had. This blend of poignant memory and joyful triumph creates a deeply moving and bittersweet atmosphere throughout the piece.
1478	13304	5	3	The mood of the memoir was heart-warming. The way Narciso Rodriguez wrote the memoir was looking back at his life as half full, not as half empty, choosing to focus on the blessings he received. Instead of pointing out or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he writes about the good parts of his childhood, highlighting the joy and security his parents provided. For example, his parents gave him opportunities despite their struggle, ensuring he had access to education and a supportive environment. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of racism and segregation, shielding him from much of the hardship. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person, shaping his own outlook on life. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was how Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are, always prioritizing these bonds above all else. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart-warming and a testament to their sacrifice.
1479	13305	5	3	"The mood set was a happy mood. As Narciso Rodriguez looked back on his life in @LOCATION1, he recalled it with great fondness and appreciation. He describes all the great experiences he had and the house he once lived in, remembering it as a center of love and cultural pride. He is also grateful because his parents gave up almost everything to provide him with a better life, leaving behind their established lives in Cuba. He says ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love,"" a sentiment that echoes throughout his recollections. He is so grateful and happy that his parents loved him so much to trade their lives in, so he could live in @LOCATION1 and have the chances they dreamed of for him."
1480	13306	5	3	"If I were to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir I would say it is positive and thankful. I am saying positive because he regards his childhood so respectfully and proudly; like how he describes his neighborhood as: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" From this quote you can tell that the author held his community in the highest of regards, as family. I describe it as thankful because based on this excerpt, you can determine that the author was taught family morals, and was raised in a household rich in Cuban culture, with its music, food, and traditions. This mood is seen by how he tells the story of how his parents made the house they live in into a home, filling it with warmth and unconditional love. The author learned the significance of his Cuban heritage, and the sacrifices his parents made to come to @LOCATION1, which in no words can he thank them enough for their selflessness and the profound gift of their journey."
1481	13307	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, grateful, and loving. The author shares her background life with us, providing a window into her formative years. She expresses to us how she feels about her passionate Cuban music, and her parents' great cooking skills. She writes, ""A love of cooking that is still with me to,"" and notes how ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air."" This shows that at this time the author is grateful about her cooking and music. The author shows herself as really grateful for all her parents have done for her, stating, ""I thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" The author's mood is so warming when she expresses her love for her parents, the music, and the cooking skills she inherited.

1482	13308	5	3	Within its walls, my young parents in the immigrant section of Newark, New Jersey, built a life for our family. Within its walls my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. It was in this warm, inviting space that our culture was preserved and celebrated daily. My parents both shared cooking duties, working together to prepare the meals that defined our heritage, and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skill and a love of cooking that has become a fundamental part of who I am today, connecting me always to my roots.
1483	13309	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and fond remembrance. The predominant mood of the story was happiness, which permeated her recollections of youth. The reason why I said that the story was happiness was because she was happy that she was growing up in such a vibrant and supportive community. In the text it says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense"" of belonging and joy. The author was happy she grew up in the neighborhood she lived in, a place filled with life. Her neighbors and friends were from Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrant backgrounds, creating a rich tapestry of cultures. In conclusion, that was the mood of the author's memoir, a reflective happiness about her upbringing."
1484	13310	5	3	The mood created by the author is a proud mood, one of deep appreciation for his origins. He is proud of his culture, the way he lived, and how his parents were caring, selfless people. His parents always kept their arms and doors open for people to get back on their feet, offering shelter and support to those in need within the community. This generosity of spirit was a cornerstone of his upbringing, filling him with a profound sense of pride for his family's values and the compassionate home they created for everyone.
1485	13311	5	3	The author was profoundly grateful for the sacrifices made on his behalf. His parents moved to America for him, so he could have a good education and better opportunities for his future. He feels he can't thank his parents enough for moving and uprooting their own lives. He tells them how much courage they have and thanks them so much for leaving their jobs and their homeland behind. He also talks about the concept of home, reflecting on how home is a place you learn to love and admire your relatives. It doesn't even matter if you're blood related; family is chosen through love and action. He will love you either way, a lesson learned from his parents' own expansive hearts.
1486	13312	5	3	In the memoir, the author describes his home environment while growing up. As a child, his home gave off a very happy and loving mood, one which was vividly recreated again in this memoir. When describing the culinary and musical habits in his home as a child, I can feel the specific happiness that the moment had possessed, the aromas from the kitchen mingling with the sounds of laughter and song. Also, I can feel the profound love between himself and his constantly growing family that surrounded his kitchen table @TIME1. So, to me, this memoir gives off a great and uplifting mood, one filled with happiness, love, and loyalty, and also with a strong sense of unity and friendship as well, leaving the reader with a warm and lasting impression.
1487	13313	5	3	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez's passage is deeply loving and grateful. Narciso creates the image of a very happy childhood, while consistently comparing her happiness to the hard work her parents toiled through and all the things they sacrificed for her. @CAPS1 often describes the feeling of closeness between her neighborhood and her family, recalling, 'In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants.' Their family consisted of a variety of people, not necessarily related by blood, but there was always a helping hand for each other in the community in times of trouble. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" The profound warmth of her childhood life is perfectly expressed in the line, 'Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' Narciso gives many examples of her happiness, but @CAPS1 always refers back to the hard work and dedication of her parents. @CAPS1 explicitly thanks her parents for giving her the opportunity to experience a better life, stating, 'I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice...' and 'I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.' Ultimately, @CAPS1 feels very grateful for her parent's strife to help her and for such an accepting neighborhood, making the overall mood of the passage one of profound love and gratitude."
1488	13314	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created. I believe Rodriguez creates a distinctly ""thankful"" mood in his memoir. In the memoir, Narciso talks about how his parents had successful lives in Cuba but came to @LOCATION1 so Narciso could have a better life and future. Narciso even said, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" showing that @CAPS1 was profoundly thankful that his parents sacrificed everything for him. Rodriguez emphasized this by saying, ""... even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" Rodriguez was also thankful for his parents' efforts in turning ""this simple house into a home,"" as his parents made his house feel warm, cozy, and full of life. @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family and community while living in this simple house. At the end, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1 could never be able to fully thank his parents for what they had sacrificed for him, cementing the passage's overarching mood of deep thankfulness."
1489	13315	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of love, care, and faith. Love is clearly shown with the quote, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This is shown in ph @NUM1. Care is demonstrated through the author's recollection that ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". This is shown in ph @NUM2. Finally, faith is evident in the statement, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us"". This is shown in ph @NUM3. Together, these three elements combine to create the heartfelt and compassionate mood that is conveyed by the author in the memoir."
1490	13316	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and filled with good thoughts. Narciso tells us what it was like growing up in a vibrant and supportive setting. She gives us the idea that she and her family were really close, sharing many experiences together. She expresses to us how proud she is to be Cuban in many ways, celebrating her heritage openly. Narciso tells us she enjoys cooking traditional foods and so do her parents, often preparing meals together. She also loves listening to Cuban music, which filled her home with rhythm and joy. Narciso lived in a traditional Cuban home, which was rich with custom and warmth. Her home was not just a simple structure; her parents created it into something more meaningful, something more special, a true sanctuary of family and culture that defined her happy childhood.
1491	13317	5	3	"The mood I get from this article is that even though Narciso Rodriguez grew up in a time of racism, his parents did everything for him and he was profoundly grateful. A few examples are in the first paragraph, where it states ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and which I am internally grateful)."" This demonstrates the loving environment they provided. Then also in a subsequent paragraph, there was a sentence that stated ""passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" These specific, heartfelt details are only some of the examples in this memoir that illustrate his deep appreciation for his upbringing, which is the central theme of the piece."
1492	13318	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a mood that inspires us to try our hardest, and that mood is perseverance. The mood of perseverance is expressed in the memoir in many ways. One way it is expressed is through the family's struggle when they moved to the United States and initially lived in a cramped one-bedroom apartment. Through hard work and determination, they finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a larger apartment. In this new neighborhood, the family continued to work tirelessly, raising as much money as possible not only to buy food for themselves but also to help others in need of basic necessities like water, shelter, and clothing. The reason they moved from Cuba was to begin a better life in the United States, a goal they pursued with unwavering resolve until the day they finally achieved a stable living situation, showcasing their remarkable perseverance throughout their journey.
1493	13319	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is one of profound kindness and warmth. Firstly, he grew up with loving and supportive parents. For example, it is noted that his parents were excellent cooks who generously passed their culinary skills down to him, indicating the time and care they invested in teaching him. Next, his deep love for his parents is clearly evident. For instance, he explicitly states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" a sentiment that would not be expressed without genuine affection. Lastly, he cherished his home and was deeply happy with his family life. The memoir mentions that ""I would never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" highlighting how the love of his family made their dwelling a place of great comfort and joy. That is why the author effectively shows love and kindness as the prevailing mood of this piece."
1494	13320	5	3	The mood created by the author was overwhelmingly positive because he consistently focused on the good aspects of his family and their life. He spoke with affection about his relatives and their supportive dynamics. Furthermore, he talked about how grateful he is that they moved to America, emphasizing the opportunities and the better life it afforded them. This focus on gratitude and the positive outcomes of their journey establishes a hopeful and appreciative tone throughout his recollection, reinforcing the positive mood of the narrative.
1495	13321	5	3	The author created a distinct mood in the memoir. The mood he created was definitely loving and warm. This is evident because the memoir kept mentioning how considerate, friendly, and passionate his family was in their daily interactions and support for one another. Also, he repeatedly reflected on how he learned what family was all about and he discovered the true meaning of family through their shared experiences and sacrifices. These recurring themes of familial love and the creation of a nurturing home environment consistently reinforce this feeling. So, the overall mood in this memoir is undeniably one of love and warmth, effectively conveyed through the author's heartfelt recollections.
1496	13322	5	3	"I think that there is a warm mood in the memoir. I think so because in the memoir, the author is talking about how thankful he is to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 despite the hardships that they faced, expressing a deep appreciation for their sacrifice. Also, there is a warm mood to this memoir because the author is reminiscing about his past with a sense of fondness for his parents and his neighbors, recalling the kindness that surrounded him. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote directly conveys the comforting and inclusive atmosphere of his upbringing. In the memoir, the author often talks about how kind the people he grew up with were, and how good of a childhood he had, which consistently reinforces the positive emotional tone. This is why I think the mood of this memoir was warm, as it is filled with gratitude and affectionate memories."
1497	13323	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is conveyed in all different ways, each contributing to the overall feeling of the narrative. In paragraph @NUM1 when she talks about her love for cooking the mood is calm with a dash of spice to it, suggesting a peaceful yet passionate activity. Since she is Cuban I like to think the cooking is spicy, which adds a layer of cultural warmth and vibrancy. In paragraph @NUM2 she states, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family..."" That is a happy loving mood, highlighting the generosity and open-heartedness that defined her home life. To be able to say that means you have some pretty amazing neighbors, which further enhances the sense of a supportive and joyful community. In paragraph @NUM3, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is the most important mood set in this memoir because she is thanking her parents for her life that she has, establishing a tone of profound respect and thankfulness. That is a very respectful thing to do, and while everyone does it, the act of writing a memoir about it immortalizes that feeling of gratitude."
1498	13324	5	3	In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The blueprints of our lives, there was a very solidary mood, a feeling of shared experience and mutual support. The @PERSON1 family was so happy to be in @LOCATION1 and be free, and no longer in Cuba, which filled their new life with a sense of relief and joy. It was a very loved environment with friends and family always coming to their table, sharing meals and companionship. They were a very caring family, always looking out for one another and those around them. They always had their arms and door wide open to other refugees until they got back on their feet, offering a safe haven and demonstrating immense compassion. They were a happy, loving, and caring @CAPS1 family, whose collective spirit created a truly warm and welcoming home.
1499	13325	5	3	"The main mood throughout this entire excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of thanks, a pervasive sense of gratitude that colors every memory. Throughout the excerpt, @ORGANIZATION1 talks about and explains how his parents struggled in the US for their children, facing numerous challenges with determination. In his house, as it is said in paragraph @NUM1, ""My young parents created our traditional Cuban home,"" a place filled with cultural heritage and love. @CAPS1 loved everything about that home, from its familiar scents to its comforting routines. Also his family, which was not just blood relatives but a chosen family, provided a strong support system. His family was made up of the entire community in a time, as described in paragraph @NUM2, ""When overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1,"" making their communal bonds even more vital. @CAPS1 is most thankful of his parents, a sentiment that forms the core of his reflection. In paragraph @NUM3 it describes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life... They struggled both personally and financially... My parents had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" His parents gave up everything for his current life and Narciso is forever grateful, a debt of love that defines the memoir's heartfelt mood."
1500	13326	5	3	The mood of the memoir was a happy and graceful mood because they live in a good neighborhood in America and they are surrounded by their family members who have dinner with them, creating a scene of daily contentment and togetherness. This environment fostered a sense of security and belonging, which is central to the narrative's positive tone. The shared meals and the presence of loved ones contributed to an atmosphere of warmth and appreciation for the simple, good things in life, which beautifully encapsulates the author's reflective and thankful perspective.
1501	13327	5	3	"The author of this memoir created a very uplifting mood through specific and heartfelt recollections. The way Narciso described her home, explained the sacrifice of her parents, and her definition of ""family"" all added to the overall positive atmosphere. Narciso's description of her home and neighborhood expresses the deep passion she feels for it. She used evocative phrases such as: ""I am eternally grateful,"" ""passionate Cuban-music,"" and ""which I adore to this day"" to express her positive feelings towards her childhood home. When the author ends paragraph two with ""life in our warm house"", the reader clearly understands she was pleased with her childhood conditions. The sacrifices and selfless actions of Narciso's parents is purely uplifting, as she notes, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage... they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" Their actions are touching and heroic, adding greatly to the uplifting mood of the memoir. The author's definition of a ""family"" is very touching as well, moving beyond conventional boundaries. She expresses that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and describes how her neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity."" This neighborhood was united and supportive of one another, creating the kind of close-knit and caring place that anyone would want to live in. The perseverance of the author's parents, the loving description of her home, and her inclusive definition of family all work in concert to create a consistently uplifting and inspiring mood for this memoir, a sentiment perfectly captured in the final sentence: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""
1502	13328	5	3	This was a touching story of how this boy appreciates his family and parents so much, establishing a consistent and heartfelt mood throughout the narrative. Home to this boy is fundamentally about family and relationships, not merely a physical structure. He talks with fondness about how he liked the kitchen and cooking, just like his mother and father, which establishes a mood of happiness and contentment. The kitchen is the heart of the home, a place he clearly loves. He also talks about his Cuban culture and how he deeply appreciates his parents' bravery for coming to a new country, which contributes to an overarching mood of gratitude. The mood is mostly one of appreciation in the story, as he is very appreciative of the life and love his parents worked so hard to provide for him, making the entire account a sincere tribute to his family.
1503	13329	5	3	The mood of this memoir is that the author is happy being with his family because he believes you should always love your family, a principle that defined his upbringing. Growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, a belief tested and proven within his neighborhood, which was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. At this time, racism and segregation prevailed in the United States, creating a challenging social landscape. Despite customs and prejudices elsewhere, all the cultures in his community came together in great solidarity and friendship, supporting one another. It was a close-knit community of hard working immigrants who consistently extended a hand to people who were not necessarily their own kind, but were clearly in need of a helping hand. The mood of this story is ultimately uplifting, demonstrating that everyone can come together in happiness and joy despite external divisions, forming a true family based on mutual respect and support.
1504	13330	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the author created a few distinct moods that are very relatable, yet make you think deeply about home and belonging. One prominent mood is happiness. This reading feels happy from the beginning to the end because it shows how Narciso went through his life, and what he loves about his childhood. One paragraph says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences show he loved the vibrant environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which was a clear source of his happiness. Narciso also created a thoughtful and somewhat mysterious mood. This mood made you think about your own home, and what the word 'family' really means on a deeper level. Narciso's family was a great, big, loving group of people—many of whom were not even related by blood. Another paragraph says ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows their consideration of family was large, inclusive, and inspiring. The main mood in this memoir from Narciso, however, is gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did. He is mostly grateful to his parents, as another paragraph states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's main mood is gratefulness because he is grateful toward everyone and everything that made his life good, shaped his character, and made him what he is now."
1505	13331	5	3	This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez had a warm, down-to-earth feeling that resonates with the reader. Narciso expresses his profound love for everything given to him by his family and his upbringing. I can tell he has a huge heart and it all starts at home, with the foundation his parents built. In the second paragraph he talks about his home life with clear affection. Everything about his family, from their shared duties to their cultural traditions, gave me a warm, sunny feeling. He sets the mood by talking about his amazing parents; they are portrayed as wonderful, selfless people. They incorporate their culture into everything, from the food they cooked to the music that filled their home. Food, in particular, is highlighted as a source of comfort, giving everyone a fuzzy feeling inside. The memoir effectively shows the warm and welcoming feeling Narciso gets when thinking about his family, successfully conveying that his home was truly the blueprint for a life filled with love and security.
1506	13332	5	3	The mood the author created for the memoir was about how, because his parents moved to @LOCATION1, he lived a life that he would never have lived before. In his life, his parents would take people in for a short period of time to help them get back on their feet because they knew that others would do the same for them. This practice of mutual aid and community support defined his upbringing, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and compassion. The author reflects on this unique aspect of his childhood with a deep sense of gratitude and warmth, recognizing how these experiences shaped his worldview and contributed to the person he became. This foundational principle of helping others in need is central to the memoir's emotional tone, illustrating a life enriched by selfless acts and communal bonds.
1507	13333	5	3	The mood in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is one of admiration, satisfaction, and courage. Narciso had admiration for his parents who sacrificed a set life for a better one for him. His parents, caring and unselfishly, came to @LOCATION2 and struggled personally and financially to build a new future. He was satisfied with the life he had; through strong family values and sheer determination, he was able to succeed. Courage is another key element because his family was able to give him a better life in their new home even though they were better off in Cuba. It was a struggle, but they were determined to do it for Narciso. The mood overall is one of profound admiration for their sacrifices and resilience. This deep admiration is the prevailing mood in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, the fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey.
1508	13334	5	3	"The author creates a warm, joyful mood in the memoir. He talks about the fond childhood memories he has in a way that gives the reader a warm, joyful feeling inside. For example, although his parents endured hardships in coming to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, they created an inviting home environment. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". (∂ @NUM1) This imagery creates a feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't necessarily based on blood. The author's community was like a family. ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community."" (∂ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (∂ @NUM3) @CAPS1, the author talks of ""the warmth of the kitchen"", (∂ @NUM4) and how the air was always filled with love. All of these passages give the reader a mental picture of joyful and warm family gatherings, instilling those feelings. This is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood. Although his parent's life was tough, they made his life full of joy and warmth, showing that one can make tough experiences into positive situations through love and community."
1509	13335	5	3	"According to the memoir, the author created a specific mood to use in his writing. The author created the mood of happiness. According to the memoir, the author was very happy with his life and the experiences that shaped him. He was very joyful that he gained all the Cuban culture and traditions from his family and community. He also is happy about all the ""family"" he has, which included both relatives and close friends who were considered kin. So you can tell by the mood he has in the memoir that the author is very happy and satisfied with the way he was raised and the cultural richness he inherited. That is how the author's mood would be accurately described in the memoir, as one of contentment and joyful remembrance."
1510	13336	5	3	In every paragraph in the memoir he explains how life was and how he loved it so much. In paragraph @NUM1 he uses parenthesis to show or talk about how much he loved different kinds of things, adding personal asides that highlight his deep affection. He shows in his writing all the warm kind of feelings he had as a child, describing scenes filled with comfort and security. In paragraphs three and four he also talks about how much he loved being with other cultures and how his parents were really good people, always welcoming and kind to everyone they met. This consistent positive reflection throughout the text reinforces the author's nostalgic and appreciative perspective on his formative years, concluding with a sense of cherished memory.
1511	13337	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound love. I feel this is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I have been grateful to my parents for there love and sacrifice,"" which highlights a deep appreciation for their selfless devotion. Another reason is in paragraph @NUM2, it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull),"" showing how love was woven into daily life and passed down through generations. And the final reason is in paragraph @NUM3 It says ""It was here where I learned the true definition of 'family' And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love,"" cementing the idea that the entire environment was a school for love. This consistent theme of gratitude and affection confirms that the overarching mood is indeed one of love."
1512	13338	5	3	I believe that the mood in this memoir is happy because the author is talking about his first friend, the landlord's daughter, and the great cooking and music that filled his home. He expresses how greatful he is to his parents for moving to america for him, highlighting their sacrifice as a source of his joy. He fondly recalls all the celibrations they had for people and how everybody in the naborhood were friends, painting a picture of a vibrant, communal life. Ultimately, the text focuses on how much he loved his family and the positive experiences of his youth. What about that is unhappy? The author's reflection is clearly filled with warmth and positive sentiment, leaving no room for sorrow.

They did struggle at times, but the author is still happy for what went right in his childhood, and having all these wonderful people there, which created a lasting sense of comfort. All of the people that came and left his house for all those years made him realize that ""family"" is just being around everyone you love and connect with which makes a house a home, a realization that solidifies the memoir's warm and affectionate tone."
1514	13340	5	3	The mood created by the turdison of Cuban heritage is one of anticipation and connection.

Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family does not only include blood-relatives but also the community around him. Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood, creating an extended network of care. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to America just to give him a better life, a monumental decision driven by hope. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him, a testament to their devotion. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things—the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to America. He constantly thanked his parents and told them that he wouldn't have been so brave without their example.

He shared that he ""was born into a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey"" but that it did not matter where he lived but who he lived with, highlighting the primacy of relationships over material circumstances. The mood you get when you read this memoir is mixed because of the way he describes his parents life, his life and his home, blending nostalgia with profound appreciation. When he says ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" he is talking about how close they all are and that, that is what matters. When you read that you feel the comfort, happiness, joy and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parents and everyone around him, effectively conveying the profound warmth at the heart of his memories."
1521	13347	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is deeply grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parents both moved to the United States from Cuba to give their children a better life than what they had. Narciso's parents initially lived in a one-room house until they moved to New Jersey, where Narciso grew up. Inside that home, the family created a beautiful Cuban community. The heart of the house was the kitchen, where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey where the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. The community was like a big family, and ""the cultures cam together in great solidarity and friendship."" All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a ""family"" really means, a concept built on shared experience rather than just blood. She never would have know what that ment or have had these oppertunities if her parents hadn't been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over from nothing. As Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a sentiment that perfectly captures his profound gratitude."
1522	13348	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author's reflections create a specific mood. ""Growing up in this environment instilled im me sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood related."" That means people that weren't blood related, he still constiders them an family, highlighting a theme of chosen kinship. He also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That mean that evan though it wasn't a nice house it was still his home and he loved it for the warmth and love within its walls. The mood of this memoir is one of love and fond remembrance, and he will never forget it. Thats the kind of mood in this memoir, a heartfelt tribute to his upbringing."
1523	13349	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of profound admiration and respect. He felt deeply appreciative and curious about his parents' journey, noting, ""my mother and father Had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the Harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship. This narrative evokes a mood that honors their immense sacrifice and resilience."
1524	13350	5	3	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very subtle and can be undefind. I say this because when I read this I didn't feel anything strongly at first, but then I thought about it. The article gave off a very comfortting and reflective mood. As he said in the memoir, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" at nothing to do being blood relative."" That quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes, ""That's true, I never thought of that way before."" This memoir does not give out blunt moobs like happy or sad, It makes you think deeply about the meaning of community. There was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. At the end of the piece he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote is another example of giving a very undefind mood, I say it is undefind because you just cant put it into words of how you feel, a complex mix of nostalgia, gratitude, and warmth. So in conclusion the mood this piece gives is undefind yet deeply felt."
1525	13351	5	3	"The mood created by the author is respectful. The mood is respectful because They came from cuba and went to America. as the author says, ""My Mother And father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"". Another reason why the mood is respectful is that the Mother and father went to this country for their child, putting his future before their own. As the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows that they moved for the kid and not For themselfs, an act that commands deep respect and admiration."
1526	13352	5	3	"I think that the overall mood of the memoir is a thankful one. Towards the end he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" which serves as a clear and direct statement of his appreciation. Also, he doesn't talk about the bad a lot, choosing not to dwell on any difficulties or negative experiences. He only briefly touches on it, acknowledging challenges without letting them define his narrative. For the rest of the memoir he is explaining how his life was wonderful, focusing on the positive aspects of his upbringing, and that he always had family around him, which provided him with constant support and a sense of belonging. This consistent focus on gratitude and positive memories firmly establishes the memoir's heartfelt tone."
1527	13353	5	3	In the article the author is trying to say how good his past was, recalling it with a deep sense of warmth and affection. The mood of the article is that it was happy memories, filled with joyous occasions, and the smell of his mom's cooking and the memories associated with it, which evoke a powerful sense of comfort and nostalgia. As a child the author's memories were happy and the home setting was central, filled with laughter and security, mostly the mood was good throughout the story, without any significant dark or sorrowful turns. Throughout the article his memories of his childhood home were happy and good, painting a picture of an idyllic and cherished time in his life that he looks back on with a smile.
1528	13354	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author creates a mood of being grateful for his cooking skills and his parent's love. One way that the author is grateful is for his cooking skills, which he views as a precious gift. The author is grateful for his mom and dad's cooking skills, which they demonstrated daily. For example, he writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Another way the author is grateful is for his parent's love, which formed the foundation of his life. The author is thankful for his parents, recognizing their profound impact. For example, he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice."" The author loves his parents for the love and sacrifice they consistently provided, which shaped him into the person he became. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author creates a sense of gratefulness for his cooking skills and his parents love, weaving these two themes together to show the depth of his appreciation for his upbringing."
1529	13355	5	3	"The whole memoir gives off a very positive attitude, focusing on the good in his past experiences. The author explains a feeling of unity and friendship that characterized his community. This quote shows this, ""… all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in Friendship,"" illustrating how people supported one another. The author is saying that despite the fact that they were living in times of racism, all different cultures and their neighborhood lived in peace and harmony, which was a remarkable achievement. One paragraph has a feeling of caring for others and love, highlighting the selfless nature of his parents. The author explains how his mother and father moved out of Cuba for better lives for generations to come. The statement, ""They came selflessly… To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their Families, Friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" shows these feelings of sacrifice perfectly. The final part of the memoir presents great thanks to the author's parents, serving as a powerful culmination of his gratitude. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents For their love and sacrifice."" Furthermore, in the last line of the memoir, the author describes the true mood of his house growing up, which was more than just a structure. The memoir reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" The author is saying that his house was not just a living space; it was full of love, caring, and great relationships that made it special. The whole memoir has a loving mood that resonates from beginning to end, leaving the reader with a strong sense of the author's affectionate and appreciative perspective."
1530	13356	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives*, the mood is one of gratefulness, which permeates the entire narrative. Mood means the overall atmosphere of the author's words, and in this case, it is consistently appreciative. I think that it is happiness, because no matter what happens, Rodriguez is always grateful for the blessings in his life. He does not care if he lives in a simple house with a bunch of people; he is happy that he has a home and a family that fills it with love. In one paragraph, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" which directly states his deep appreciation. I would have looked up to him, for being this grateful and happy for what he has, demonstrating a commendable and positive outlook on life. Also, the last sentence he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" reinforces the theme of finding value beyond material wealth. These are a perfect example of the mood, gratefulness, and some of happiness, that defines the entire memoir and leaves a lasting impression of thankfulness."
1531	13357	5	3	"The mood created by the author was structured around many things, evolving organically as the narrative unfolds. First of all, it is a light, warm, happy mood as the author describes how he grew up in a simple but loving neighborhood, filled with the sounds of laughter and community. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" It continues to be a friendly, cheerful mood throughout the whole memoir, painting a picture of a supportive and vibrant environment. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author describes the profound sacrifices made for that life, explaining how ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" In this way, he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir, mirroring the complex emotions of the immigrant experience. It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again, ultimately creating a rich and heartfelt emotional landscape."
1532	13358	5	3	The mood created in the memoir is one of love and care, a feeling that permeates the author's recollections of his family's life. This Cuban family used to live in a smaller apartment building, but now they live in a slightly larger bedroom apartment, a change that symbolizes their progress and stability. Now they are inviting people in, treating friends and family members with immense love and care, and that positive atmosphere will inevitably rub off on the kids, shaping their values and worldview. It is a good thing that they did that, fostering a sense of community and belonging within their own home. Also, the fact that the neighborhood itself was good and welcoming further reinforced this nurturing and affectionate mood, creating a safe and joyful environment for the children to grow up in.
1533	13359	5	3	"The mood created by the author is that your family will always be there for you, providing a foundation of unwavering support and love. A quote from the story that encapsulates this is ""I will never forget how my parents made this simple house into a home,"" highlighting the emotional security they built. The mood might also be that there are always better opportunities in life, a theme of hope and aspiration. What this means is that Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved to a new country for a better opportunity for their kids, sacrificing their own comfort for the next generation's future. This sentiment is echoed in another line: ""It was here were I learned the real definition of 'family'."" The author's deep appreciation is summarized in the final reflection, ""And for this I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love,"" which solidifies the mood of familial devotion and gratitude."
1534	13360	5	3	I think the mood that the author created was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have, encouraging reflection on one's own blessings. It is a mood that urges you to always remember where you came from, and to always love family, emphasizing the importance of roots and kinship. At some points in the memoir the mood become more about unity and community, for example in a specific paragraph he tells how his neighborhood growing up was made up of many races including Spanish, Cuban, and Italian, and he tells how they all came together in solidarity and friendship, creating a vibrant tapestry of cultures. He also says how his family was always helping each other, demonstrating that support begins at home but extends outward. In conclusion, I believe the main mood in this memoir would be one of togetherness and coming together, whether it be as a family, or as people from different backgrounds forming a single community.
1535	13361	5	3	"In this memoir, the author created a proud and glad mood, reflecting on his upbringing with deep affection and respect. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, showed how proud he was of his family and home through his memoir, detailing their resilience and warmth. His parents left their home in order to make a better life for him and for that he is extremely proud and grateful, recognizing their courage. His parents also allowed other immigrants to stay with them temporarily, extending the family's kindness to others in need. In one paragraph he says, ""what They did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done,"" directly expressing his profound admiration. Narciso shows how glad he was that he got to grow up where he did, surrounded by love. He had his parents, as well as all of his neighbors, which he considered his extended family, creating a wide network of support. Though his apartment wasn't the nicest place to live, it was his home, filled with cherished memories. He was happy there and always had people around him who loved and cared for him. In another paragraph he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a testament to their love. Through these reflections, Narciso shows his proud and glad feelings, crafting a memoir that is a tribute to his family and their journey."
1536	13362	5	3	The mood of the author is proud and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live at their house, opening their doors to those in need. When they didn't have much money, they took any job they could get so they could care for their son, Narciso. They had a three-bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country, filling their home with joyous occasions. They also had their house full of love and life, a vibrant atmosphere created by their generous spirit. Also, they came to this country without knowing how to speak the language, facing that challenge with determination. So the mood of this story for the author seems to be proud, reflecting on the resilience and kindness that defined his family's journey.
1537	13363	5	3	I think the mood of the memoir is comforting and happy because it talks about how a simple house became a home. The memoir shows how a family can turn a random house into a home with love and by selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet, offering a safe harbor. The memoir also shows how family has nothing to do with being blood related; it's about being there for one another in a time of need, creating bonds of support and community. I think that shows a great amount of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment could become a loving home, filled with family and love, where everyone looked out for each other.
1538	13364	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today, a cherished inheritance for which he is eternally grateful. That passion is something he loves to follow, honoring his parents' goals, and he loves them very much. In addition, he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home, creating a welcoming space. He loves them for their strength and perseverance, and he has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age, and for how he now knows how important family and friends truly are.
1539	13365	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is gratefulness. Throughout the memoir, the mood created is one of deep gratefulness for the life his parents built. There are many quotes in the memoir that support the mood created. One quote is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" which directly conveys his heartfelt appreciation. He is grateful for his parents giving him a better life in America and for raising him up to be a good man, instilling in him the values of hard work and kindness that have guided his path."
1540	13366	5	3	The mood would probably be happy and sort of sad at the same time because on one hand he's describing his family's happiness and unity amongst his family and Spanish and Italian families around the area, with shared meals and community gatherings. But the mood is also touched with sadness because of the segregation in America that they encountered, a contrasting reality to their close-knit home life. This complex mix of joy and sorrow defines the emotional landscape of his memories, reflecting both the warmth of his community and the challenges they faced in a new land.
1541	13367	5	3	The mood created by the author is a good and positive mood; it describes his and his family's struggles but is very optimistic and cheerful even though they left behind jobs, friends, and family. They are all very resilient and happy to enjoy their lives in New Jersey while maintaining their vibrant Cuban setting and cultural traditions. This blend of old and new creates a warm and hopeful atmosphere throughout the narrative, emphasizing the joy found in their new beginning.
1542	13368	5	3	The mood in this memoir is one of happiness, love, and warmth. It conveys a powerful message about being thankful for what you have and not focusing solely on what you want to have. Narciso was just happy to have such a loving and supportive family around him. Inside of Narciso's home, the atmosphere is consistently portrayed as happy, loving, and warm, filled with shared meals and laughter. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing else truly matters as long as you have your family by your side. Overall, the mood created by the author in the story is one of profound love and deep appreciation for these simple, yet essential, blessings in life.
1543	13369	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because the author shows great admiration and respect for his parents, grandparents, and his childhood house, which was always full of life. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage fondly talks about the author's hometown, his rich culture, and the familiar sounds and smells of his community. It also talks about what he is genuinely grateful for, and that would be his hardworking parents and the passionate Cuban music that filled his home. In conclusion, that is what I think the mood is, which is consistently nice and happy throughout the story of Narciso Rodriguez.
1544	13370	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of hopeful determination. The character Narciso's parents moved from Cuba to the United States to have better opportunities in life, seeking a brighter future for their family. When they came to America, they worked hard to build a new home, and the author, as a child, found joy in this new environment; he became friends with a girl named Alegria, whose friendship brought him happiness and a sense of belonging in his new country. This friendship highlights the positive aspects of their journey and the warm, welcoming mood that can be found even during times of significant change and adaptation.
1545	13371	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was strong and deeply felt. The mood, or the feeling received from the author, was shown in a profoundly grateful sense. The author admired his parents and was so touched by their teachings and the life lessons they imparted. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The lovingness of his parents and their open arms, always extended in stride, left Narciso feeling genuinely appreciative. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Even though the author's parents overcame many obstacles after moving to a new country, it never stopped them from aiming for success and providing for their loved ones. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the work they deserved."" Despite these challenges, Narciso's parents created not just a house but a true home, and for that, he was ever grateful. The mood is ultimately one of thankfulness and gratefulness in this memoir, a tribute to their enduring spirit and love."
1546	13372	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a profound sense of family. He recounts how when his parents immigrated from Cuba to Newark, New Jersey, they had to start completely over and find a new beginning in a foreign land. Within the kitchen of their modest three-room apartment in a two-family building, they passed on their rich culinary skills and a deep love for Cuban food, creating a central hub for the household. He describes how the surrounding community was composed of people from all different races, yet they all became one big family that supported each other to get through the racist times the United States experienced in the era. He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and immense sacrifice. He reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he simply cannot believe how they managed to accomplish so much from so little. So the overarching mood in this memoir is fundamentally about the strength and love of family.
1547	13373	5	3	"In this memoir the mood varies, shifting to reflect different facets of the author's experience. In paragraphs three and four it was a distinctly ""giving"" mood, for example as explained in paragraph four: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This sentence clearly shows that they generously gave people in need what they required during difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven the mood transitions to one that is thankful and happy for the immense sacrifice his parents gave for him, all to secure a better future for their child. In paragraphs one and two the mood is happy and comfy because she expresses pure happiness about her home, her family, and the abundant love she has been given throughout her life. These are the various and heartfelt moods that are woven throughout the memoir."
1548	13374	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he speaks of how his family, related or not, provided the happiness and wonderful memories of his childhood that he adored so much. The overall feel to the memoir, or its mood, was expressed as gracious and thankful to his family, but also warm and happy, creating vivid pictures in the reader's mind of a lovely and cherished childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" said Rodriguez, showing his profound thanks to his parents for allowing him to grow up in America. He knew that many immigrants risked everything to come raise their children in America and for that opportunity he is eternally thankful. He also praises the other families of different cultures in his neighborhood, giving more of a grateful and unified atmosphere to the memoir. ""It was a close-knit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people in need."" The mood of the memoir is happy and warm as Rodriguez describes his cozy home filled with music, sweet smells, and welcoming people. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family, and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home."" Rodriguez's mood and feeling is clearly and effectively expressed through his rich descriptions and fond memories."
1549	13375	5	3	The mood is the memoir is happiness, for example at the end he says you can find happiness anywhere and he did. He found it in a abandoned home, which he transformed into a place of joy and comfort. The memoir says that he got all the things his parents didn't get, opportunities and a stable life, which shows his deep-seated happiness. This overarching feeling of contentment and joy is what defines the narrative's emotional core.
1550	13376	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a warm and heartfelt feeling. Narciso Rodriguez explains how thoughtful and selfless his family was throughout his upbringing. In one paragraph, Narciso reveals how cozy his surroundings were, writing, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)... Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Narciso further explains how kind and brave his parents were, noting that ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Narciso tells us how much he loves both his parents and how profoundly grateful he is to them. In the end, Narciso expresses one last thank you to his parents, stating, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" All in all, the mood that the author created in this memoir is a very welcoming, heart-warming and inspiring one."
1551	13377	5	3	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a reflective and appreciative mood throughout it. I think that the central idea is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms, built on love and community rather than just a physical structure. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" illustrating how relationships were its foundation. In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country,' showing their generosity extended beyond the family. Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven, ultimately defining home as a place filled with love and shared humanity."
1552	13378	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home; the Blueprint of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a warm, pleasant mood. He does this in several ways, one being him writing about how they overcame segregation. He says that ""...Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants... In our neighborhood,...all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In this manner, he creates a bright feeling by saying that even when segregation was dominant, everyone in his community was friends, united in their new lives. Another way he made the story pleasant sounding is how he talks about his parents. Althroughout the excerpt he talks how grateful he is to his parents, mainly because of how kind and loving they were. As he puts it, ""They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" By giving up their lives, they were able to make others' lives better. Due to this, he is grateful for the love and support his parents offered to him, and because of this uplifting theme, Narciso Rodriguez creates a smooth, pleasant, warm, and loving tone throughout his memoir."
1553	13379	5	3	The mood created by the author indicates how family and happiness is the best thing, and how a home is where you feel safe and happy, not just a physical space, but a place of comfort and safeness. Narciso made his home a good place for him and his family through the love and warmth that filled it, transforming the simple structure into a sanctuary. He had a place to call home because it was defined by these emotional qualities of security and joy, which were more important than the building itself. This fundamental feeling of belonging is what truly characterized his childhood environment and left a lasting impression.
1554	13380	5	3	The mood that the author creates is that his culture is very enthusiastic and vibrant, and that his home is where he made it through the efforts of his family. And that his parents were very generous and selfless, creating a welcoming environment for all who entered, and that he is eternally grateful for that profound sacrifice. This gratitude permeates the narrative, highlighting the deep appreciation he holds for the life they built. His home was not just a location but a testament to their love and hard work, a sentiment that defines the entire memoir's emotional core.
1555	13381	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and nostalgic. I think that the moods are nostalgic and thankful because there are certain parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is looking back fondly, and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father for their sacrifices and the loving environment they provided. His reflections are filled with a deep sense of appreciation for his past and the people who shaped it. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir, as they are consistently conveyed through his heartfelt recollections. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir, which together create a sincere and warmly reflective tone.
1556	13382	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very upbeat and happy one. This is primarily because he uses the memoir to describe how happy and upbeat his house was as a child, focusing on the warmth and security provided by his family. He does this by saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a statement that resonates with deep affection. This indicates a profoundly happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents' love and sacrifice helped pave the road to his future, instilling in him a lasting sense of gratitude and joy. That is ultimately why the overall mood of the memoir remains so distinctly happy and positive."
1557	13383	5	3	The mood of this memoir is happy and affectionate. The main character of this story is Narciso, who was kind of poor; he and his family lived in a one-bedroom apartment. He didn't mind the modest circumstances because he loved everyone around him, especially his parents, because they gave him everything they could, including their unwavering support. This foundation of love and support was crucial, and now Narciso Rodriguez is a successful fashion designer in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, a achievement that reflects his positive beginnings.
1558	13384	5	3	"The short story called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""The Blueprint of Our Lives"" establishes a mood centered on love and family. This is because in the story, all he talks about is his parents and how much they mean to him, highlighting their profound influence on his life. He reflects on their nurturing presence and the values they imparted, which shaped his character and his outlook. The narrative consistently returns to this theme of familial devotion, thereby solidifying the overarching moods of love and family throughout the entire article."
1559	13385	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood seems to be happy and deeply grateful. To me it seems as if the author is trying to show his great love and respect for his parents and how they have taught him everything he knows, emphasizing that without them he would be nowhere. This sentiment is clear when he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This shows that the author's mood is set to be happy and about love and how he is extremely grateful to have them in his life. Also it shows his love for what his parents have taught him, which is further illustrated when he notes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This also shows that the mood is a happy one because he is explaining everything great his parents have done for him, reinforcing his profound appreciation."
1560	13386	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, he included many stories about his family and parents. The stories, along with the parentheses expressing more of his personal opinion, effectively created three main moods throughout the memoir. The moods the author created were those of happiness, humor, and kindness. The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and his family. At the dinner table, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso set a mood that was very happy and convivial. During those meals that he and his family shared, they would often laugh together, strengthening their bonds. Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso put a personal touch on his experiences, adding a light-hearted feel. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information often had a hint of warm humor and kindness. Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind and appreciative tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were to him and others. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community, noting acts like extending a 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need'. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir there were the consistent tones of happiness, humor, and kindness. All three of these moods were involved, one way or another, with his most important thing, which was always his family.
1561	13387	5	3	The mood conveyed by the author through his memory was profoundly happy and thankful. He expresses this sentiment by reflecting on his house in New Jersey, which brings him happy memories. For example, he recalls his kitchen where his parents shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that remains with him. He also remembers his neighborhood, which was composed of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants whose customs were displayed, and all these cultures came together in great solidarity and mutual support. Furthermore, it was a place where his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, fostering a deep sense of community. He feels profoundly grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, often telling them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than he could have ever done. He will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a true home, a place filled with love, warmth, and enduring memories.
1562	13388	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1, a distinct mood was created throughout the story. The mood was a complex blend of emotions, shifting between different paragraphs to reflect the author's experiences. In paragraph @NUM1, the mood was both joyful and heart-breaking, as illustrated by the description, ""Situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section."" This shows how Narciso felt a deep, nostalgic connection to her home in New Jersey back in 1961, a feeling tinged with the sadness of time passed.

1563	13389	5	3	"The prevailing mood of this memoir is the profound importance of family. @ORGANIZATION1 says in the beginning how much he loves his Cuban culture and heritage, establishing a tone of cultural pride and familial devotion. For example, he writes, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This illustrates that Narciso Rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much, finding joy and identity in these sensory family experiences. Him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people, as seen in the statement, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us."" This expansive definition of family is further reinforced as Narciso became close to other immigrants who were not blood-related to him. He explains, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" Through these bonds, Narciso was close to many people whom he considered family, solidifying the memoir's central theme that family is built on love and community, not just biology."
1564	13390	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,"" the mood is portrayed as very cheerful, warm, and happy. The way that the author described his home and early years provided a vivid image of a large, happy family throughout the passage, filled with love and celebration. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This portrays the image that life in the author's home was consistently friendly and loving, a place of security and joy. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This means that their family was very close-knit and would always look out for each other, embodying a spirit of unconditional support and generosity. So in conclusion, the mood in this memoir is portrayed as very happy, upbeat, and loving, effectively conveying the author's deep appreciation for his formative years."
1565	13391	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir shows that he is grateful to have a home to live in, a home provided by his parents when he was born.

They let anyone into their home and kept each other safer from the racists, creating a protective community bound by solidarity and shared experience. This sense of security and belonging was fundamental to the environment they fostered, ensuring everyone felt valued and defended against external prejudices. Ultimately, the home stood as a bastion of kindness in a challenging world.
1567	13393	5	3	"They were different kinds of mood in this memoir. The mood created by the author is a happiness and love mood. I know that because everywhere in the article the author talks about love and happiness. To prove that it says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air not just scent in music but life and love."" This vivid description highlights how daily life was infused with joy and affection. I know the mood is happiness because there is always positive things in this memoir, from family gatherings to celebrations of culture. Also, with love comes happiness. That's why I think the mood of this memoir is love and happiness, seamlessly intertwined throughout the narrative."
1568	13394	5	3	"The author created a loving and accepting mood in the memoir. He first does this when talking about his family's dinner table. The author says, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that his parents would help anyone and treat anyone like family in a time of need, establishing a foundation of unconditional support. Second, the author describes this mood in chapter seven. He opens the chapter with, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and were I celebrated my first birthdays."" His parents were so loving and caring that they celebrated with complete strangers and family their arrival, extending their hospitality to newcomers. Lastly, the author ends his memoir with a powerful sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""

Throughout the author's memoir, he creates a mood of loving, caring, and accepting that defines his family's legacy."
1569	13395	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* is non-fiction.

This emotional foundation is central to understanding the memoir's heartfelt tone."
1570	13396	5	3	In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful for his parents. The overall mood is happy and very grateful. It is happy and grateful because his parents came from Cuba and started a new life in New Jersey, but they made their house to look like a regular Cuban home, preserving their heritage with intention and pride. He is also very proud. He is proud of his Cuban background and culture, which was lovingly maintained through traditions, food, and language. He is also happy his parents kept their homes open to everybody, fostering a sense of community. He is grateful for his parents sacrifice and love, which provided him with a strong foundation. Those are the overall moods of the memoir, each one reflecting a deep appreciation for his family's journey and values.
1571	13397	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood author created is thankfulness and gratefulness towards Narciso's parents, family, and friends for making his house a home and also gratefulness toward just his parents because they gave him a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage. without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 saying this Narciso is expressing thanks and graditude toward his parents for their immense courage and selflessness.

The mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez gratitude, a sentiment that permeates the entire memoir."
1572	13398	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that when he arrived in the United States he was given the opportunty that so many immigrants wanted and that was education, a chance for a brighter future. His parents still carried that cuban culture they had that was especially in their kitchen because both his parent loved making food, and they had great culunary skills which he learned from watching them. They would have cuban music going while they were setting the table, filling the home with familiar sounds and aromas. The @CAPS1 tells us that when his parent were still in Cuba his dad worked in a laboratory and his mother had studied chemical enginerring, showing the professional lives they left behind. The @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" acknowledging the depth of their personal sacrifice for his benefit. This reflection solidifies the overall mood of profound appreciation."
1573	13399	5	3	"There are a few ways to describe the mood the @CAPS2 created in this memoir. They description im going to give is the @CAPS2 created a very happy & loving mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1. it say's ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That means that family doesnt have to be blood related for you and that person to unite and became very good friends, creating a powerful sense of community. Also another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" That shows she's a very loving and caring person to actually be @CAPS1 for something your parents have done, highlighting a deep familial bond. Those are a few way's to describe how the @CAPS2 created this happy and loving mood through these specific examples from the text."
1574	13400	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and comforting. The author described his home with great words and descriptions that evoked a strong sense of place and belonging. While describing the meals and get togethers, the author made me feel at home, as if I were a guest at his family's table. Memories are sometimes greater than plans of the future, and this memoir captures that sentiment perfectly. Memories of homes are the best in remembering times at home, and the author excels at sharing these. This memoir made me think of past times and happy memories from my own life. The vocabulary and extra information in this memoir made the mood of it very happy and comforting and made me want to read more about his past life and the experiences that shaped him. The overall effect is one of nostalgic warmth.
1575	13401	5	3	"There are alot of ways to describe the mood in this memoir, The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming.One example is in paragraph @NUM1, when Narciso Rodriguez is describing his house, he says, ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM2, when he says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" showing how his community shaped his values. And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" illustrating the supportive atmosphere. And @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need,"" further emphasizing the theme of unity. @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, ""they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" which is the foundational act of love. In the memoir the mood that is created is heartwarming. Narciso Rodriguez's parents did a lot of this for him to make him feel like its Cuba, recreating their homeland's spirit in a new land. In my prospective this memoir is probably the most touching to my heart because of its sincere portrayal of sacrifice and love."
1576	13402	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is good. It's good because everybody is happy. Narciso is in a good mood and inviting everybody into is his, a sentiment perfectly captured by his declaration, ""My door will always be open."" This open and welcoming atmosphere was further enhanced by the constant presence of music playing in their houses, which filled the neighborhood with a lively and joyful spirit. The excerpt also highlights the unique social fabric of the community, stating, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The people were also very unselfish, caring of everyone, and did whatever they could for there families, creating a strong support system. In this memoir there was a overall pretty good mood of everybody because they were nice, inviting, and caring, fostering a profound sense of belonging and communal well-being."
1577	13403	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the author is grateful. The author is from Cuba who lives in a modest three-room apartment. That is big coming from a one-room apartment, and the author says that they turn this little space into a cuban home, imbuing it with cultural significance. One reason Rodriguez is grateful is because his house was always filled with love, friends, and family, creating a vibrant and supportive environment. Rodriguez is also grateful of his parents, expressing deep admiration for their journey as he says ""they came to this country with such courage."" This appreciation is a recurring theme, as Rodriguez also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author loves his parents and is very thankful for all they have done including ""turning this simple house into a home,"" which encapsulates the grateful mood created by the author in the memoir."
1578	13404	5	3	"The mood created by the author of this memoir was very warm and loving. He talks about his family and friends throughout the piece, and how much they have changed his life, emphasizing their profound impact. He talks about Cuba and its culture flowing through the home, how his parents threw their careers away so that their children can have a good life, and how everyone in his neighborhood was very close knit as if they were a family, bound by shared experiences. All these aspects of his life thrown together with words like ""faith"", ""struggle"", ""admiration"" and ""selflessly"", among many others, makes for a very compelling piece that has a strong heartfelt mood, leaving the reader with a deep sense of the author's affectionate and appreciative perspective."
1579	13405	5	3	"There are many strong feelings in the memoir but gratitude is the most important one. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", Narciso Rodriguez talks about all of the sacrifices and love in his house hold and how he is forever grateful for his parents selflessness. ""Love of cooking that is still with me today (and for what I am extremely grateful)"" is what Rodriguez says he appreciates, highlighting a lasting gift from his upbringing. He is also appreciative for the way he grew up and how his parents taught him that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" a lesson that shaped his worldview. He is so appreciative that he tells his parents constantly that he ""will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author especially expresses the mood of gratitude in the line, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Rodriguez is forever appreciative to his parents and their strong decisions that made him the person he is today, a sentiment that forms the emotional core of his recollections."
1580	13406	5	3	"The mood the author had created in the memoir is happiness for his home. The author says that family doesn't have to be blood related, a belief central to his childhood experience. The author states, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" illustrating how his community redefined the meaning of kinship. This expansive and inclusive definition of family, filled with love and mutual support from neighbors and friends, is the fundamental source of the happy and contented mood that permeates his reflections on his past."
1581	13407	5	3	The mood of the memoir is actually happy and grateful. I think this because the kid thanked his parents for letting them move to @LOCATION1 and all of them were happy that they took this sacrifice, Narciso especially. Narciso always thanks his mom and dad for their bravery. He @CAPS1 he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that, which clearly shows his deep appreciation. That is how it is grateful. Something about the story has a very happy feel to it. Because the family is together and they are talking about how happy they are living with each other and even in @LOCATION1 it adds a very happy feel to it, a sense of contentment and shared joy. The author successfully conveys this positive atmosphere, making the reader feel the family's unity and satisfaction. That is what I think the author tried to create in the memoir, a warm and appreciative tone.
1582	13408	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" Narciso tells all about his parents and how grateful he is. Narciso created a mood during this memoir, he talked about his mom and dad and how they created his house into a home, filling it with love and security. Narciso's parents sacrificed a lot to move to @LOCATION1 and give their children a good life, even if it meant them having to leave behind family, friends and careers. The mood created overall was that I felt thankful for my home and family here in @LOCATION1. Then I also felt sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything behind for their children, a profound and difficult choice. they also had to leave behind family, which is very hard to do, creating a poignant mix of emotions for the reader. Narciso's parents made a very tough but wise decision but in the end it was worth it, as it secured a brighter future for their family."
1583	13409	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say a loving mood because through-out the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood, demonstrating their profound dedication. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says ""countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" That is the final reason of why I think the mood of the memoir is a loving mood, as it highlights the family's generous and open-hearted nature."
1584	13410	5	3	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, by @PERSON1, he talks about how thankful he is. One thing is that he is thankful for his babysitter and friend giving them food when they needed it. Also he was thankful for the community he had. Lastly, he was thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice, which formed the foundation of his gratitude. He said that ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table more often than not."" (@NUM1, Rodriguez) this shows he everybody helped each other out, a testament to the supportive network around them. Next he says that ""our neighborhood... Came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (@NUM2, Rodriguez) this how close-knit Rodriguez's community was, reinforcing his appreciation. Lastly, he says that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how thankful he is toward his parents for sacrificing almost everything for him, the ultimate act of love. By Narciso Rodriguez wrote this in a thankful mood. He thanks his babysitter, he thanks his community, and he thanks his parents. All of them contributed to his life in meaningful and essential ways."
1585	13411	5	3	"The mood that is @CAPS1 and that it is created by the author in the memoir is the feeling of being thankful. This is the mood @CAPS1 because it says ""Their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This @CAPS3 the mood is thankful because author is thankful for the culinary skills that is still with him, a lasting gift from his past. Another that @CAPS3 the mood thankful is when it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This @CAPS3 the mood thankful because @CAPS5 is thankful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, the central theme of his appreciation. Another that @CAPS3 the mood as thankful is when it says: ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" This @CAPS3 the mood as thankful because @CAPS5 is thankful for all they have done and @CAPS5 could never be more courageous than them, acknowledging their superior bravery. This is the mood of the memoir created by the author, a consistent and heartfelt tone of gratitude."
1586	13412	5	3	The mood created by the author is a warm happy mood, which is effectively conveyed through the focus on familial love and strong personal bonds. This is because he is talking about the love and bonds of family, illustrating how these connections provide comfort and joy. He also is talking about home and how a house can become a home through the presence of loved ones and shared experiences. He also talks about how he and most people are grateful for family and friends, highlighting a universal sense of appreciation for these relationships. All of this blends together to form a happy, good, warm mood to the story, leaving the reader with a positive and heartfelt impression.
1587	13413	5	3	I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in paragraph @NUM1, in the beginning Narciso's parent gave up their life in their home country. This significant sacrifice, made out of love for their children, establishes a foundation of hope and optimism. Their willingness to start anew in an unfamiliar place for the sake of their family's future inherently carries a positive and uplifting feeling. This act of devotion directly contributes to the overall sense of happiness that permeates the narrative, as it underscores the profound value of family.
1588	13414	5	3	The mood the author was in was @CAPS1 & happy. The reason it was happy & @CAPS1 is because they talked about being @CAPS3, which suggests a state of contentment and satisfaction with life. And living in a @NUM1 @CAPS4 apartment is described not as a hardship but as a place filled with life and love. The narrative focuses on the joy found in simple, shared living spaces and the strength of family unity, which together create a genuinely positive and uplifting atmosphere throughout the text.
1589	13415	5	3	"In the excerpt of the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood created is one of love for family and friends. The author explains his parents' reasons for immigrating with such love and devotion that it is hard to not feel the same way, as their sacrifice is framed as an ultimate act of care. The author describes how everyone would eat together and they often had many more people eating with them, emphasizing a welcoming and inclusive household. The author says ""...countless extended family members came and went..."" and then continues on to describe how his family lets other family members come stay with them until they get back on their feet, showcasing a deep sense of loyalty and support. The author really shows the mood of the excerpt in a loving way and does this the most when saying you will always be grateful to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 for him. The author shows that he truly cares about his family, and this sincere appreciation solidifies the text's heartfelt and affectionate tone."
1590	13416	5	3	"The mood the author creates in the memoir shows a soothing and grateful memory of the author's home and relatives. The author creates a peaceful tone representing calmness, comfort, and happiness displayed in his memories. One example of the author's way of creating a comfy and peaceful mood is in paragraph @NUM1 ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 two sentences give a deep and warm thought of family and friends along with comforting images of kitchens and sweet aromas of cooking. This type of writing gives the reader a calm mood based on the comforting words used in the sentence such as passionate, aromas, innocence, and warm. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where the author displays happiness and shows his gratefulness for having family and what his family has done for him. This adds to the mood in the memoir by representing how great family is and how much it can mean to people, reinforcing the themes of thankfulness and belonging. Overall the author uses calming and strong words to get his images and feelings through in the memoir. Because of this he was able to create a peaceful, and comfortable mood while expressing his love for family and friends, successfully immersing the reader in his nostalgic and tender reflection."
1591	13417	5	3	The mood about the story is happy. The reason why is because the story talks about how the kid learns a lot of things from his young parents. The boy learns that his father was born in Cuba but his father had to leave to New York even though he didn't want to. He also learns that his mom and dad like to cook a lot together, and he also learns that they make schedules for each other to organize their time. Even though they moved to New York they still do what they used to do in Cuba, and they let people visit even though they don't know them, maintaining their open and welcoming traditions from their homeland.
1592	13418	5	3	"The mood created by the author was grateful. The mood is grateful because he gives thanks to his parents for ""... their love and sacrifice"" (∂@NUM1). This memoir is based on the definition of family. Rodriguez explains that family means many things. It means helping others, accepting everyone, and for his parents, giving up your life so your children could have a better one. He recalls the many people his mother and father help, showing kindness to neighbors and friends. The people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family are a testament to this. He reflects on the courage and selflessness of his parents leaving their country to start over in a new place. He tells them of his ""...admiration of their strength and perseverance"" (∂@NUM1). There is still ""no way to express my gratitude"" (∂@NUM1), he also states, acknowledging the depth of his debt. He will be forever grateful to his parents for these lessons that have formed his life and his character."
1593	13419	5	3	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" stays constant throughout the story. First, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"". This quote talks about when Narciso's mom and dad take people in their house that need a home, but they are not blood relative family, showing their open-hearted nature. Second, ""my mother and father came to this country not knowing the culture or language to give me a better life."" Even though his mom and dad knew nothing about the language or culture in America, and didn't want to leave friends and family, Rodriguez's mother and father sacrificed it all to give him a better life and future opportunities. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that it's a simple house but it turned into a safe home with all the people he loves around him, filled with warmth and affection. All in all, the mood of this memoir is happy. The author makes all his challenges seem happy through his positive reflections."
1594	13420	5	3	I think this is the Cuban Childhood. This memoir is about a young girl that tells about her life and her parents' life. She is saying when her parents moved from Cuba to the United States in 1956, seeking a new beginning. It says when she was born in 1961 and she is saying she was born in a simple house, which was their family home. This memoir is saying about the little girl's family, when did they move and where did they lived after arriving in their new country, detailing their journey and settlement.
1595	13421	5	3	"In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the author sets a mood of relaxation, happiness, joy, and an overall feeling of over satisfaction and unity. The author describes his feelings of being at his home and how much it made him feel overjoyed and content. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this particular sentence the author is trying to get the mood as like a heaven on earth thing, a place of perfect peace. The author while trying to give the reader factual information about his home, is also trying to exaggerate the emotion and make it seem like a paradise for his family. In paragraphs @NUM2, @NUM3 and @NUM4 the author emphasizes how courageous, kind, and selfless his parents are and how he will always be grateful to them for that. He shows it in statements like ""They came selflessly...to give their children a better life"" and ""Generosity and selflessness are two lessons my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives."" The author sets the mood in the story as a paradise for everyone who entered their home."
1596	13422	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is one of unity, as shown in paragraph @NUM1: ""Our neighborhood was made mostly up of Spanish, Cuban, and @CAPS1 immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Secondly, they had courage, as shown in paragraph @NUM2: ""My mother and my father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language and culture."" They came selflessly, as many @CAPS2 immigrants did, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved. That is the resilient and communal mood created by the memoir."
1597	13423	5	3	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is one of warmth and belonging. First, at the end of the memoir, @CAPS2 was @CAPS3: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS4 @CAPS3 one is, ""it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthday."" My @CAPS6 mood that I am going to tell you about is one of profound acceptance. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'Family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS7 are the moods of gratitude and inclusive love created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir."
1598	13424	5	3	"The @CAPS1 created in the @CAPS2 is not that of a @CAPS3 one. The @CAPS1 created is cheerful and happy, as the narrator talks about his family and childhood with fondness. @CAPS4 talks about how his neighborhood consisted of many races, as stated in paragraph @NUM1: ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" @CAPS4 talks about how they all lived together in peace and @ORGANIZATION1, forming a supportive community. This @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that the meaning of family does not necessarily mean you have to be related. The @CAPS1 is ultimately happy and reinforces the idea that friends are family too, creating a mood of joyful unity."
1599	13425	5	3	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir was one of happiness, love, unity, and satisfaction. These words describe the mood because in the memoir the author would talk about how eternally grateful he is for his family and their bond. He talked about the struggles they had but how they saw past them and realized that as long as they have each other, that's all that matters. They got along great and were very happy they had each other's support. They also helped other people in need which seemed to complete their lives and bring them joy. They saw everyone as family and, as little as they had, all they wanted was to give back to others. That was the generous and loving mood created by the author.
1600	13426	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud of his parents and proud to be a Cuban. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents gave up their wonderful jobs in Cuba and now are working jobs that they don't like, all for the sake of their family's future. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where Narciso says that this environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative, highlighting the inclusive community they built. Narciso is grateful for his parents and grateful for being in @LOCATION1, which culminates in a mood of deep appreciation and pride."
1601	13427	5	3	"The memoir has a very happy and warm mood to it. Paragraph @NUM1 gives a real feeling for what the author's home was like, vividly describing the sensory details of daily life. It talks about the aromatic food and the lively music that the author emphasises his love for, elements that filled the house with joy. Paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 give information on how close the community was, portraying a network of support and friendship. The author talks about how great his friend Alegria was and says she ""graced"" their kitchen, suggesting she brought elegance and warmth with her presence. Throughout the memoir, the author explains how happy his home was and with his detailed, evocative descriptions the reader gets a genuine feel for the happiness too, sharing in the author's cherished memories."
1602	13428	5	3	"The overall mood of the author and the memoir was profoundly happy and grateful. He or she seemed proud of everything about their identity and heritage, expressing a deep-seated contentment. He or she didn't let anyone stand in their way of embracing their culture, home, and parents, showing a resilient spirit. For example the author said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a statement filled with emotion. When i read that last sentence of the whole memoir I understood what feeling the author was getting across, a powerful sense of belonging. He or she was in all kinds of positive moods throughout the narrative. Some was happy, some was deeply grateful, and some was genuinely exciting and uplifting. The mood the author was in made me realize that I need to appreciate what I got in my own life, reflecting on my own blessings. In my home, in my school, everywhere and everyone around me, I felt a new sense of value. The mood of the author in the memoir was ultimately grateful and happy, leaving a lasting impression of thankfulness."
1603	13429	5	3	"This article @PERSON1 has created a significantly different and reflective mood for me as a reader. I was first bored by the premise, but now I'm more genuinely grateful of my parents and their own journey. My parents had also moved from a different country to the United States, seeking new opportunities. They moved from @LOCATION2 to here @CAPS1 so the children could have a better life and education, a sacrifice I now appreciate more deeply. This article also says that close friends can also be family, a concept that resonated with me, and now that I think about it, I think it's profoundly true. The author says ""growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood relatives,"" which encapsulates a beautiful idea. That's the kind of thoughtful and appreciative mood this author created for me as I read this memoir, changing my perspective on family and friendship."
1604	13430	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the most important thing is undoubtedly love, which forms the core of the narrative. It talks about how much Narciso cares for his family and holds them in high esteem. The mood is one of deep love, sincere admiration and profound gratefulness. Narciso is so grateful for what his parents did for him, acknowledging their immense sacrifices. To give up everything to go to a better place was their ultimate gift. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" says Narciso, summarizing his feelings. Another powerful mood is also love, which permeates every part of the story. In the memoir it expresses a great deal of love that's in his family, a bond that sustained them. "".. It meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". They gave up everything for Narciso who they truely love, a testament to their devotion. You get the feel of admiration when Narciso says ""They showed me with thier lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life,"" indicating how he modeled his own life after theirs. The overall feelings of the memoir is love, admiration and gratefulness, a powerful combination. Narciso learned a lot from his family, carrying their lessons forward. ""I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home"" is a final, poignant reminder of the love that built his world."
1605	13431	5	3	In this memoir the author gives the mood a strong sense of inspiration, as well as a deep love of family and friends, creating a multifaceted emotional experience. In the memoir the author talks about how great it is that the author's parents had turned a simple ordinary house into a home, which means that the author's parents had made thier house to feel like home by bringing their Cuban culture into the house. This was achieved through elements such as authentic Cuban food, vibrant Cuban music, and distinctive Cuban decoration, which filled the space with life. That makes the memoir a fundamentally happy mood, celebrating cultural identity. But there is also a layer of inspiration to this memoir because it basically tells readers that it doesn't matter who your blood relatives are; family is defined by love and connection. It conveys that family is ultimately the people who love and care about you the most, a universally uplifting message.
1606	13432	5	3	The mood of this memoir is very happy and loving. Throughout the story Narciso shows how much he appreciates that his parents gave him the opportunities to grow up in @LOCATION1, a place that became a true foundation for his life. He shows that this memoir is loving by explaining how his mom and dad always had their arms and doors open to anybody they considered family, offering food, comfort, and unwavering support. The memoir is happy because it shows that he has a lot of good relations with many people that he calls family, creating a vibrant and supportive community around him. He is also happy because he knows how much it takes to move from your home country to @CAPS1, and he deeply values the immense sacrifice his parents made for a better future. Overall Narciso had a very happy, loving childhood filled with the warmth of a close-knit community.
1607	13433	5	3	The mood created by the author is a happy and warm tone. In paragraph @NUM1 he recalls enjoying Cuban music, the lively rhythms filling his home, and learning to cook traditional dishes with care and passion. He also recalls making friends with other immigrants, bonding over shared experiences, and learning to love and help everyone without hesitation (@NUM2). In paragraph @NUM3 he recalls learning the true meaning of family and what it means to make a house, a home, realizing it is built on love and shared memories. The mood created is warm and loving and teaches the true meaning of family and of selfless behavior and that home is about the family, not the physical space it occupies.
1608	13434	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness and satisfaction. I know this because in the story the main character is happy. As he arrives in New Jersey he enjoys how his parents create their house looking like a traditional Cuban home, filling it with familiar scents and decorations. He is passionate of the Cuban music that he adores listening to everyday, the sounds connecting him to his heritage. Another thing is that the main character is satisfied with what his parents do for him, recognizing their hard work. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last thing is that he is thankful to his parents because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thank them repeatedly."" These are the moods the author created in the memoir, a heartfelt tribute to his parents' journey."
1609	13435	5	3	The mood created in Rodriguez's memoir is one of gratefulness and happiness. There are supporting feelings such as coziness and friendliness but Rodriguez himself most exhibits gratefulness. In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him, lessons in generosity and connection. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their Cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love and life, you can feel the joy in these simple, shared moments. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him materialistically, but being genuinely grateful of the nature and kindness bestowed to him, which he carries forward in his own life.
1610	13436	5	3	The mood of this memoir is loving. It's @CAPS1 you how you should look back at your home and your family, with a deep sense of affection and gratitude. They all love you and how you love all of them, creating a powerful and unbreakable bond. How every one was always there for every one, through good times and bad, offering support without question. This sense of unwavering mutual support and deep affection defines the entire narrative, showing that love was the true foundation of his upbringing and the central theme of his reflections on the past.
1611	13437	5	3	"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1 he makes the mood seem loving, cheerful, and grateful. The mood is grateful to Rodriguez's parents for making his house more of a home among other things. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 his parents did a ton for Rodriguez and he is constantly grateful for their efforts. Their is also a lot of love in the mood of the book because there are lots of mentions of family and the warmth they provided. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family."" @CAPS2 arms opened and a big ""family"" are surely signs of lots of love and a welcoming spirit. The mood of the excerpt is also cheerful because as Rodriguez says ""Passionate salsa music filled the air."" And ""a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air."" Music and feasting are two of the most cheerful things there are, creating an atmosphere of joy and celebration. By recalling experiences from his childhood @PERSON2 manages to make the mood of his memoir loving, grateful, and cheerful all at the same time, weaving these emotions together seamlessly."
1612	13438	5	3	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a positive, greatful mood. The author ""will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" I know because a writes a few paragraphs just to show how thankful @CAPS1 is to his parents for everything they endured. @CAPS1 describes how great their jobs were in Cuba and then how poor they became in the @LOCATION1, but yet they still worked hard to give their children a better life and never complained. ""In a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country where I celebrated my first birthdays."" @CAPS1 describes everything, as a positive learning experience, but shows that throughout the memoir, the theme is positive and greatful, focusing on the blessings found even in times of hardship."
1613	13439	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir the author's mood feel sad. Because in the cuba, @PERSON1, had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering, holding professional positions. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find, which was a difficult transition. In author memoir @CAPS1 will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice, yet the underlying tone reflects the sadness of their lost status and the challenges they faced in their new country, creating a complex emotional landscape.
1614	13440	5	3	"The mood in this memoir is gratitude. Narciso is so greatfull and proud to have grown up where he did and have the family he had. ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Narciso is telling the readers that even thogh the people in his neighborhood were all different, they were still family and supported one another. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote tells you that even though things were ruff he still is gratefull for all the opertunities his parents gave him and the loving environment they created, which is the central feeling of the narrative."
1615	13441	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy for remember the most important peoples on his life, the poor house were he lives when he had his first birthday and a different kind of people in the place were his family live. He was grateful for everything to his parents gived to him when he was a little boy and the education how his parents give it to him, which he recalls with fondness and appreciation. This nostalgic reflection on his humble beginnings and the sacrifices made for his upbringing establishes a tone of heartfelt thankfulness and positive remembrance of his past.
1616	13442	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates an overall mood of love and compassion for family and shows the strength of his own family. Narciso explains that his parents' love of cooking and their consistent willingness to let other people in ""instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This foundational belief shaped his understanding of community. Also, this memoir shows people facing hardships together. Narciso explains how his neighborhood and his own family overcame racism collectively, which further sets the mood that they loved and supported each other through difficult times. Lastly, this memoir shows love and sacrifice. Narciso explains that his parents ""struggled both personally and financially"" during their move to @LOCATION1, facing significant challenges to build a new life. But despite these struggles, Narciso's parents still showed him how to love unconditionally. From his parents, Narciso has learned to love, and for that profound lesson, he deeply admires his parents."
1617	13443	5	3	Based on the author in the @CAPS1, the mood created by the author was both happy and sad. I said that the mood created by the author was happy because he lived in a comfortable environment made by their neighborhood, which was mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time; there was no racism and no segregation, so he lived in his home peacefully. The sad thing, however, was that Narciso Rodriguez learned how to love and the definition of family and about how to love, but he said that he would never know how his parents turned a house into a simple home, a sentiment that carries a touch of melancholy for the past. This complex mix of emotions defines the reflective tone of his memories.
1618	13444	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez the author's mood is happy, and @CAPS1 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He loves his family and friends oh so dearly, holding them in the highest regard. He is also grateful to have a lot of his family members who are close to him, a tight-knit circle that could get together for dinner and a lot more, creating cherished memories. The author says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music life and love,"" illustrating the profound joy he found in these simple, familial moments. As you can see in the memoir, the author felt genuinely happy and grateful @CAPS1 for the enduring love and sacrifice of his family, which formed the cornerstone of his life."
1619	13445	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey, with great fondness and detail. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of ""family"" that guided his upbringing. I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming, a direct result of his affectionate recollections. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immigrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age for him, they still managed to raise him, and do a lot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, one that he'll always remember with gratitude. He also talks about how ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", which meant that you could even consider someone not blood related to you, as your own flesh and blood, your true family. This inclusive philosophy is central to his narrative."
1620	13446	5	3	I think he has a really great life and he's a happy person, as evidenced by the positive reflections found within his writings. And also he appreciates what happens in his life, showing a deep sense of gratitude for both the significant events and the simple, everyday moments that have shaped him. This appreciation contributes significantly to his overall contentment and optimistic outlook, allowing him to find value in all his experiences.
1621	13447	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of love, caring, and thankfulness. I say this because she really appreciates what her parents have done for her, recognizing their efforts and the environment they built. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, she says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This direct statement underscores her deep gratitude. Furthermore, the author describes the supportive community, noting ""it was a close knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were really in need,"" in @CAPS1 @NUM2. This shows that Narciso and her family can trust the people in their community, which contributes to a thankful mood because they know that they would never do anything to hurt them. In the last @CAPS1, it says ""it was here where I learned the real definition of family and I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows how thankful, loving, and caring she is to his parents. Narciso is proud of his parents because they let people stay with them when they needed to, demonstrating their open-hearted nature.

The parents cook and celebrate things with the neighbors, sharing meals and cultural traditions that brought everyone together.

The mood of this story is overall very happy, sharing, caring, and grateful because of how nice the parents were.

The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a very inspiring and happy memoir to read, with the mood to match it, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and community."
1624	13450	5	3	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a mood of joy, and hope that permeates the narrative. His parents came to @LOCATION1 in a time of racial segregation, which presented significant obstacles. they persevered through the hard time with their child by having close bonds with friends and family that lived nearby, creating a strong support network. Culture was passed on to Narciso and he loved the @CAPS1 and music he grew up with, which provided a foundation of identity and happiness. Narciso's @CAPS2 always invited family into their home when they needed help, offering shelter and comfort without hesitation. Also, many people that weren't related to them shared dinner with them each night, turning their home into a communal hub. In the Rodriguez's home, there was hope to get better and joy for the moment, a resilient optimism that defined their experience and shaped the memoir's uplifting tone.

Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they lived in and how it always made them remember as if they were still there, the tone is warm and positive. So if I was in the author's shoes I would feel good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of things that mean a lot to you, because the outcome was a life filled with love and strong values. That sense of contentment and positive reflection is what I think the author's mood is throughout the memoir.

1627	13453	5	3	"The author creates a grateful mood in the memoir.

This @CAPS1 that the author is grateful enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood-related parents, highlighting a profound thankfulness for the love he received. In paragraph @NUM3 in the first @NUM4 sentences, the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with courage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This @CAPS1 that the author is also generous because he realizes the immense love and sacrifice it takes to do this for one's family. Also, in paragraph @NUM5 sentence @NUM4 he says that he has told his parents that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did.

1629	13455	5	3	"In this memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, he portrayed a very specific mood. This mood made me feel that I was there, or part of the story that he was telling. I felt this way because by familiarizing your readers with your characters, that makes writing the rest of the story a lot easier and draws the reader into the narrative. For example, in paragraph two, I was able to get a sense of what his home and family life was like-especially with this line, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" @CAPS1 line that I felt was special to the story was, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who... were clearly in need"" I liked this statement especially because it showed me, as the reader, how caring those people were, fostering a sense of shared humanity.

Throughout the excerpt @CAPS4 recalls all the feasts, parties and guests @CAPS4 had at the ""simple house"" his parents turned ""into a home"" as stated in @CAPS3 @NUM1. This tells me that the author had very good memories at the house @CAPS4 loved and grew up in, filled with warmth and fond remembrance. The author also gives off a very compassionate mood. In @CAPS3 @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS4 describes his community as ""close-knit"" and ""honest"". This tells me that the author was very similar to his community and loved all of them and was grateful his parents took their time to make his life the best they could, showing deep empathy. The mood is lastly @CAPS5. In @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says his community ""extended a hand to people who were clearly in need."" @CAPS4 calls his parents actions of coming to @LOCATION1 ""courageous."" @CAPS4 takes pride in his Cuban family and @ORGANIZATION1 and all of the immigrants @CAPS4 grew up around, which tells me @CAPS4 knows they accomplished a big feat in their lives, creating a powerful sense of admiration.

As you can tell, this family loves being together and enjoys each other's company, which solidifies the overall peaceful and affectionate atmosphere of the narrative."
1634	13460	5	3	The mood conveyed in the memoir was profoundly great, characterized by an overwhelming sense of warmth and contentment. The author reflects fondly on his childhood experiences, emphasizing the joy and security found within his family home. This positive emotional tone is established through descriptions of shared meals, familial bonds, and a supportive community environment. The great mood is consistently maintained as the author recounts these cherished memories, leaving the reader with a strong impression of a happy and fulfilling upbringing that is remembered with deep affection and satisfaction.
1635	13461	5	3	In this article, the author's mood seemed to be predominantly happy and good. For example, he appreciates that his parents are selfless and hard-working people who tried to make his life happy and fulfilling. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family, which added to the joyful atmosphere. He also values how they taught him things that they know how to do, such as cooking, sharing their knowledge with generosity. His mood did seem to change slightly when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit easier than how it was in New Jersey, introducing a note of contrast. They tried to make as much as they could in their new environment, and his mood seemed to be a bit worried during this recollection of their struggles. However, his mood changed to be happy again when he mentioned that he loves the way they treated their house like a real home, ultimately concluding on a positive note about the enduring comfort and love his family created.
1636	13462	5	3	"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to the United States. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and might never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throughout the memoir, skillfully blending these complex emotions to reflect the immigrant experience."
1637	13463	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, there are several ways in which the author created the mood. For instance, when the author states how his family is from Cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment. The authors states, ""originally from Cuba... could afford to move into a modest... apartment I would soon call home"" (paragraph 2). This quote shows, that the authors parents wanted to give him a good life and a stable foundation. They did this by moving themselves and him to New Jersey. Another example occurs when, the author describes what his kitchen ""heart of the house"" is like and how even though they are in New Jersey, their house still feels like Cuba. The author says, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph 3). This quote demonstrates, that the authors family made sure he still knew what Cuba is like by preserving their cultural traditions. The authors parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (Cuba and America). Last, when the author says how grateful he is about his parents and the way he grew up. The author says, ""I learned the real definition of ""family""... I learned there how to love"" (paragraph 5). This quote shows, that the author has learned all the important skills in life from his upbringing. Thanks to his family he now knows how to love and treat everyone with respect, which are the core values they instilled in him. Clearly, there are many ways the author created the mood for the excerpt, weaving together themes of sacrifice, culture, and gratitude."
1638	13464	5	3	"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion and warmth. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph 3). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and the sensory richness of his home. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family and the strong community bonds. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph 4). Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate and appreciative atmosphere. The author says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (paragraph 5). Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir a passionate mood is displayed, reflecting his deep emotional connection to his heritage and family."
1639	13465	5	3	"In 'Narciso Rodriguez,' the author creates mood in several ways. The mood created by the author is a warm, happy mood that associates with feelings of family and love. The first place we can see this mood is in paragraph four where the narrator tells us ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that everyone in their community loved each other and helped each other, which added to the mood of family and love by creating a sense of extended kinship. The narrator also tells us of his parents that ""they came selflessly, as most immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This shows that the narrator's parents loved him so much that they wanted the absolute best for him no matter where it took them, highlighting the depth of their familial devotion. This shows they feel family is very important to them adding to the mood of family created by the author. The final place this mood can be seen is when the narrator tells us that he would ""always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and that it was from his parents that he ""learned the real definition of family."" This shows how much he loved and respected his parents which added to the warm, loving mood of appreciation and respect. In 'Narciso Rodriguez' several things used by the author create a warm mood of family and love that permeates the entire narrative."
1640	13466	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting and appreciative. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it, recalling it with warmth. Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir, painting a vivid picture of a vibrant household. He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education, which forms the emotional core of his story. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to America and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped immigrants who needed support, extending the comfort they built to others. This cycle of receiving and giving back adds a layer of profound gratitude to the comforting mood of the memoir.
1641	13467	5	3	"The mood is obviously love and gratefulness, as the author states, ""(And for which I am eternally grateful)."" The boy is young, so he doesn't quite grasp the magnitude of his parents' sacrifice. ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" This monumental effort meant leaving behind their entire world: family, friends, new jobs, and a house, all to provide a greater future for their son. He is profoundly thankful that his parents, despite this upheaval, were still able to keep his Cuban heritage and life alive within their new home, never forgetting where they came from. Now, upon reflection, one of his moods could also be tinged with sadness because he was the reason for all that happened. He wonders what would have occurred if he had never been born; he would never have discovered the true meaning of family. That is why this memoir carries within it a complex blend of gratefulness, deep love, and that little bit of lingering sadness, all intertwined to form a complete emotional picture."
1642	13468	5	3	The mood created in the author of the memoir was very different from the moods of other people. We all have different mood swings, but some individuals possess a consistent emotional state that never seems to change. The author's experience highlights one way you can understand this: you need to change how you act around others and learn to get to know them for who they are individually, observing the way they are when they are alone and not merely performing for their friends. This distinction is crucial for forming genuine connections and appreciating the unique emotional landscape each person carries within them, which is the central point of this reflection.
1643	13469	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir is happy and warm. The memoir is happy and warm because it beautifully describes how a small home can be a place of immense joy and contentment. As noted, it says ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This evocative description shows that love and vitality fill the air, which inherently creates a happy and comforting atmosphere. The author skillfully uses these sensory details of scent, sound, and emotion to build this uplifting mood, demonstrating how a simple environment can be transformed by the positive energy within it. That is precisely how the author creates such a resonant and pleasant mood for the reader."
1644	13470	5	3	"""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"" is a warm tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir stated, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This perspective would change the way a reader perceives the entire narrative. It becomes a story of a young child who perceptively understood the physical and mental qualities of the adults around him. The author acknowledges the troubles he and his parents faced. As part of a neighborhood of immigrants during a time of racism and segregation, the author learned how to appreciate this ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants."" He understood how his father, Narciso Rodriguez Sr., and his mother struggled personally and financially. He became deeply grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home within Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggled to find work in difficult financial times. The author clearly adores them, writing, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these formative relationships and the examples of the various people in his community, this memoir would risk being a selfish story of a child. Instead, the author appreciates everything his family and community have done for him. There was a profound generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age, teaching him how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez wrote a memoir devoted to the powerful bonds he created with his parents and the resilient refugees amongst them, honoring their collective spirit and sacrifice."
1645	13471	5	3	"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood; he has, in my opinion, created around three distinct feelings: love, gratitude, and caring. The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just about blood relatives; it can be anyone. In his specific case, his whole neighborhood became his family. This idea that family can be anyone you hold dear is central to the feeling of love, and that is how the author effectively built that mood. When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the strong mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is clearly grateful for all the things his parents did for him; one powerful example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My own parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level, and I know I am grateful for them making that big decision, which mirrors the author's sentiment. I also think the mood of caring was created by the author. I believe that because in the memoir the author mentions that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" This act made me feel as if the family was exceptionally caring; it is not something just anyone would do, so this generosity firmly established the mood of caring. That is why I felt these three moods were skillfully created by the author, working together to convey the depth of his childhood experience."
1646	13472	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez speaks with nothing but warm fondness and gratitude as she describes her childhood home. The loving way she talks about her parents' apartment and their kitchen, filled with the aromas of traditional meals and the vibrant sounds of Cuban music, and the Cuban culture they combined into their everyday lives suggest that Narciso has wonderful memories of her parents. Obviously, she is very grateful for everything her parents did for her and the chance for her to grow up in such a tender community - where ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" but was instead built on shared love and support. The entire memoir is written with such care and attention to sweet detail. The author clearly feels blessed that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to the United States in order for her to live a better life, to experience the importance of friends and family, and to learn about the true meaning of love through Cuban culture, a legacy she carries with her always."
1647	13473	5	3	I think the overall mood in this memoir was one of deep appreciation and gladness. The author was profoundly glad to have grown up with such good parents and was especially moved by how they were not selfish, always putting their child's needs and future ahead of their own. This sense of thankfulness for their selfless love and guidance permeates the entire narrative, creating a warm and heartfelt tone that leaves a lasting impression on the reader about the value of a nurturing family.
1648	13474	5	3	I think that the mood that the author created was an unpleasant one. One reason is because he lived in a one-room apartment, so that must mean that they are poor and likely struggled with daily hardships. Furthermore, the implication that they live in a poor town without any food adds to this somber atmosphere, painting a picture of a difficult and deprived childhood. This overall sense of scarcity and hardship establishes a gloomy and distressing mood throughout the recounted memories.
1649	13475	5	3	The mood in this memoir is one of gratitude. This is first seen in the opening paragraph when he talks about cooking and Cuban music, recalling these elements with deep affection. It is also present in the second paragraph when he talks about leaving their home country, acknowledging the sacrifice his parents made. A third time this mood is seen in the final paragraph when he tries to say thank you, but can't find the right words to fully express his debt. The mood in this memoir is overwhelmingly one of gratitude and it is easiest to see in these three key passages that structure the narrative.
1650	13476	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir could be strong to many people once they put it together. Narciso's parents started off in a home that meant nothing, a simple and unremarkable space. However, Narciso's parents turned it into something great through their love, culture, and unwavering spirit. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" What he was trying to explain was that your home is what you make of it, and that true richness comes from the love within, not the structure itself. That is what I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is."
1651	13477	5	3	The mood that the author created in the memoir was very thankful. He was very thankful for his parents coming to the United States from Cuba, which provided him with significant opportunities. The opportunities it gave him led to a better education and a path to be successful. In the memoir he was thankful for all the people that helped him in this new country and supported him and his family, as he did the same for the people that supported him. This overarching sense of being thankful was the primary mood that Narciso Rodriguez showed in this memoir, defining his reflective and appreciative tone.
1652	13478	5	3	The author created the memoir because he wanted to remember other people, the family that don't live with us, and to honor their memory. The author reminds us about the importance of culture and other stuff, such as traditions and shared experiences. The author created the memoir of Narciso because he is talking about family, emphasizing the deep connections and bonds that define his heritage and personal history, ensuring these memories are preserved for the future.
1653	13479	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is nostalgic, gratefulness, and an overall feeling of warmth from the story. One reason would be the mood of celebrations with his families and friends; from paragraph 3, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Also the mood is gratefulness by how the family keeps their arms open for people who need help because they knew that their friends and family would do the same; from paragraph 4, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" There was also a depressing mood because Narciso's family had to move from their friends and jobs to have a better life for their child; from paragraph 5, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also they're grateful and feel admiration for what they did coming there; from paragraph 6, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The moods created by this memoir filled the heart with depressing language, gratefulness, nostalgia, and admiration, completing the emotional journey of the memoir."
1654	13480	5	3	"The author of the memoir creates a very grateful and happy mood. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The author appreciates what his parents did for him. He knows it was hard for his parents to leave their country for him. ""They struggled both personally and financially... I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author values what his parents struggled through, as it allowed him to grow up the way he did and have the life that meant so much to him. He admires his parents for being as brave as they were. The author expresses in his writing what his parents did for him and what it means to him. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful for his parents. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast... always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" The author recalls how his parents brought him up in a happy way. He remembers how his parents showed him love. Ultimately, Narciso Rodriguez is grateful, proud, and happy for his parents and the life they built."
1655	13481	5	3	"Throughout the passage, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author displays many moods in his writing. One of the moods of the story is love. His family filled their home with things they loved, like the food they ate and the music they played. And they also loved the people in their family, not just their real family but the people in their neighborhood that they considered family. They would always have people eat over and stay over if they needed to, showing their open-hearted nature. And the other mood of the story is being grateful. Narciso Rodriguez was grateful that his parents gave up everything to come to America so he could have a good life. They gave up all their friends, family, jobs, and the country they loved so he could have a good life, and he was grateful for all the things that they taught him. These intertwined feelings of love and gratitude form the essential mood of the story, illustrating a deep appreciation for family and sacrifice."
1656	13482	5	3	"While living with his immigrated parents in the United States, the author created a reflective and appreciative mood with the memoir. First, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso explains that part of the warmth in his home is generated by having endless celebrations with family and friends, which fostered a strong sense of community. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 he stated, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This statement underscores his deep admiration for them. Finally, he has mentioned that he learned the real definition of ""family"" and about how to love unconditionally within his own home. In conclusion, the author successfully created a heartfelt mood while talking about his memoir, conveying a powerful sense of gratitude and belonging."
1657	13483	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, the mood in the memoir is emotional and loving. In this story the @CAPS3 talks about how his parents are immigrants who worked hard to build a new life. He recounts how his parents were nice enough to let people stay in their home, offering shelter and support to others in need. The narrative further highlights how they welcomed people to stay with them, demonstrating incredible generosity and creating a strong, loving atmosphere. This openness and kindness are central to the warm and affectionate tone of the story, illustrating the profound impact of his parents' compassionate actions."
1658	13484	5	3	The author that wrote this story created a lot of mood through various emotional layers. First, the story created a lot of love. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, his parents had to leave all that they loved; they had to leave their country, family, friends, and their careers, which highlights the depth of their sacrifice. Secondly, there is a lot of gratefulness in the story. For example, in paragraph @NUM2, Narciso is very grateful for what his parents had to give up and for their unconditional love. He also said that what they did was more courageous than something that he could have ever done, expressing his profound respect. Thirdly, there is a lot of sadness and generosity. Narciso is stating how impressed he was by his parents' generous nature and he realizes how important friends and family are, as discussed in paragraph @NUM2. Narciso also states in paragraph @NUM2 that the two lessons that he learned weren't just taught, but were shown by his parents' lives and actions. I think that this story was very touching and created a lot of mood and emotion as I was reading, leaving a lasting impression of familial devotion.
1659	13485	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a warm and happy one. He does this by talking about his home, friendship, and his neighborhood. He creates this happy feeling by vividly describing his home. He talks about his simple house which was transformed into a vibrant Cuban home. His kitchen has aromas of delicious food constantly filling the air, creating a sense of comfort. The rich skill of cooking was passed on to him, connecting generations. In this house, he enjoyed the innocence of childhood, surrounded by love and security. The second way he creates a happy mood is by talking about friendship. He talked about how his landlord's daughter was his friend and babysitter, sharing many joyful moments. This led to a playful, warm tone as he mentioned his grandparents who also enjoyed a festive meal at his house, strengthening family bonds. The last way is by talking about his neighborhood. He talked about how the immigrants in his neighborhood all helped each other, forming a supportive network. They all came to @LOCATION1 hardworking and willing to succeed together. The author also wrote that family doesn't need blood, emphasizing the chosen family within his community. Those are the ways that the author created a happy and uplifting mood in the memoir, celebrating community and belonging.
1660	13486	5	3	The mood that was created by the author was a warm feeling because the text describes a strong sense of pride and gratefulness for his family's journey. Also, it gives a @CAPS1 and sense of a good family relationship, highlighting the love and support that defined his upbringing. The author also puts genuine feeling into his writing, making the narrative feel personal and sincere. Those are the feelings that the author describes, culminating in a touching portrait of familial love and appreciation that resonates with the reader.
1661	13487	5	3	"After reading the selection ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 I have decided that as a child @PERSON1 seemed to have a very fun and vibrant life. Also the memoir seemed to have a good and uplifting mood to it. One thing that made the mood good was all the talking about parties and the lively gatherings. I like parties and thinking about parties during @CAPS1 makes it a little less @CAPS2 racking and more enjoyable. Another thing that sets a good mood is the talk about how Narciso's parents are always upbeat and ready for any thing, creating a positive atmosphere. The final thing that makes the selection have a very good mood is how Narciso talks about all his family and friends with such warmth and affection. When I think of good memories of my family and friends it always brings a smile to my face, just as his recollections do. Overall this memoir made me feel good and brightened my day with its cheerful reflections."
1662	13488	5	3	The mood set by the author is deeply thankful and appreciative. The author says that he is happy and grateful to have his parents in his life. He thanks them sincerely for giving him a life in @LOCATION1, but still carrying out their cherished Cuban ways and traditions. He was happy to have others come into his small apartment and sit down and act like family, which fostered a strong sense of community. He likes that his parents are selfless and that they care about others, always putting people first. He also enjoyed learning to cook from them, which he says he adores it to this day, a skill that brings him lasting joy. This sense of gratitude permeates the entire memoir, leaving a warm and positive impression.
1663	13489	5	3	"The mood the author created in the memoir is... to show how to be grateful and to appreciate what you have in life, no matter how simple. Like in the memoir Narciso lives in a apartment with one bed room, which was modest. But he loved it there and there was and is good memories associated with that home. Narciso quotes on @CAPS1 @NUM1.... ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thank them repedatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon, me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are. That quote told every thing; it captured the whole mood of the story and the very last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" perfectly concludes this theme of heartfelt thankfulness. This final thought solidifies the message that love and family are what truly create a home."
1664	13490	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of appreciation and happiness. @CAPS1 does this by starting with some background about his childhood, and by the end moving to the profound lessons @CAPS1 learned from his parents about life and generosity. First, @CAPS1 describes how wonderful this enviornment was in paragraph @NUM1. ""My young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen... My parents passed on to me... a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air..."" @CAPS1 continues by describing how wonderful a place to grow up it was and how his parents showed him genorosity through their everyday actions. Next, @CAPS1 says how hard it was for his parents to leave everything they knew, just for their children. In states in paragraph @NUM2, ""they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 continues by writing of how strong they were by showing him the value of family and friends and genorosity above all else. This shows how apprecitive @CAPS1 was of them and their immense sacrifices. Overall, by communicating this mood, @CAPS1 was able to honor his parents that much more and share their inspiring story."
1665	13491	5	3	The mood that I was feeling in this passage was how much just a simple home and a loving family together can mean. And in this tough @CAPS2 stage in life you can always go and still have some one who would do @CAPS3 for you, providing unwavering support. And this passage really makes you relize how great full you are to have a loving family no mater what circumstances you face. It highlights the profound comfort and security that comes from such a close-knit and caring family unit, a sentiment that resonates deeply with the reader. This realization fosters a deep sense of appreciation for the simple, enduring bonds of family.
1666	13492	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez tried to create a warm feeling in your heart, remembering all of the pleasant childhood memories, and to think about all the sacrifices our parents made, to try to give us a good life. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers,"" said the designer while trying to explain how parents only want to give their children a good life, a sentiment that resonates deeply with the universal theme of parental devotion and the enduring hope for the next generation's prosperity and happiness."
1667	13493	5	3	In the memoir, the author creates a tone that is a powerful blend of nostalgia, love, and unity. The author shows a profound nostalgia for his home country of Cuba. He says how much he loves the culinary creations of the culture, the music, and the celebrations with his extended family. As a result of his deep-seated nostalgia, it shows that you can have a sense of home even if you are in another country. The author also sets a love-filled tone because of how open his family was to other people. His family would let many people into their home and build a great friendship with them, regardless of race or cultural beliefs, fostering a welcoming atmosphere. The author sets a tone of unity as well. This feeling of unity is a result of how all the different people in his neighborhood, even though they come from all different countries, always worked well together and showed the utmost respect for one another. This is how the author masterfully set a tone of nostalgia, love, and unity throughout the memoir.
1668	13494	5	3	There were several different moods created by the author; some were deeply peaceful. Like he was talking about his first memories and the warmth of the kitchen during a Cuban feast. The author also established a mood of courage when reflecting on his parents moving to the United States. He expresses admiration for their strength and perseverance. Furthermore, the memoir conveys a mood of faith that sustained them through struggle and hard times, illustrating the complex emotional landscape of their immigrant experience.
1669	13495	5	3	The mood in this memoir is caring, happy, and loving. First, it is caring. For example, the narrator would do anything for his family, demonstrating his deep commitment through his actions. If he did not do anything for his loved ones, he would not be showing care for them. Second, it is happy. For example, the narrator fondly recalls having a babysitter and making his first friend, moments filled with simple childhood joy. Lastly, it is loving. An example is when he talks about his parents. He is very grateful when he speaks about his parents and the mood effectively describes that by making the home feel deeply loved and cherished.
1670	13496	5	3	The mood was him just trying to remember all of his past memories as a child and his home; what he could remember was all good things, with nothing negative about his home. What I read was that it was a very good, healthy environment where he had friends and had a good mother, a life so idyllic that everybody wishes their life was like that, filled with warmth and positive recollections from his early years.
1671	13497	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives the author has a very appreciative mood. One example of this is when he says, ""(and for which I am an eternally grateful)"" this shows that he is incredibly thankful to his parents for everything they have done for him. A second example is, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" By the author saying that you can see how much gratitude he has for his parents for everything they have done for him. Lastly, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" This tells us that the author truly understands what her parents did for her and the profound sense of appreciation that defines the memoir. That is the mood in the memoir."
1672	13498	5	3	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is grateful. The narrator in this memoir is very grateful as it states in the text, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He also says that they have done a more courageous thing than he could ever do, highlighting his deep respect for them. The narrator is also very proud of being Cuban and expresses how he loves Cuban music. He also states that he loves his house, noting, ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays"". These fond memories and expressions of thankfulness confirm that the mood created by the author is grateful in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."
1673	13499	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the designer, the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. You can tell that the mood is happy because throughout the memoir the author tells about all the good times that they had in their house in Newark, New Jersey. The author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there, creating a warm and joyful atmosphere. He also tells about how there was always Cuban music and Cuban food, which contributed to the lively and cheerful environment. They used to have a great deal of fun at that house, filled with positive family gatherings. That's how you can tell that the overall mood is happy."
1674	13500	5	3	In the short story of Narciso Rodriguez, there is a very happy mood. The story has a lot of examples of how his family was so nice and supportive. He says how his parents made their house a home, and how they put a lot of their Cuban heritage into the house, which created a warm and inviting atmosphere. The story says that he was incredibly grateful to have parents that gave him so much love and sacrifice, feelings that are central to his happiness. These elements of family warmth, cultural pride, and deep gratitude all combine to show that the mood in the story is definitely a very happy one.
1675	13501	5	3	I think the author was happy. I think he was because he has a nice house and a nice family that provided him with a strong foundation. Another reason why I think he was happy is because he is now in the United States but still remains deeply connected to his Cuban culture, which gives him a sense of belonging. His parents moved to the United States I think because they wanted to live there and start a family in a place of new opportunity. The combination of a supportive family and the preservation of his heritage in a new home are the reasons why I think that this is the mood of the author in this memoir.
1676	13502	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the author creates a specific mood throughout the narrative. In paragraph @NUM1, the speaker shows the readers how much love and happiness flowed through his family's house. He describes the cooking by his loving parents, who passed down their culinary skills to him, and the passionate Cuban music that was played, which he loved. The presence of friends and endless celebrations further defined this atmosphere. This established a happy mood that the author was creating because there was cooking, music, parties and just happiness flowing through the air. In paragraph @NUM2, the author notes that Narciso's parents came to this country wanting to give their children a better life even though they had left behind the country they loved. This shows the profound love and sacrifice on which his parents acted, providing a foundation for his happy life. In paragraph @NUM3, the author expresses being grateful for his parents' love and sacrifices. This shows the deep love and appreciation he has for his parents for turning a simple house into a home he can always remember with warmth and affection. In conclusion, the author successfully creates a mood of joyful gratitude in the memoir."
1677	13503	5	3	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, it portrays the mood of Narciso's home and his relationship with his parents. The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful and cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home alive with Cuban food and music, which establishes that the mood was very cultural and vibrant. Throughout the story it was hopeful; they left Cuba and only lived in a @NUM1 room apartment but his parents were consistently hopeful they would succeed in their new country. It was also very alive as they always had someone other than their immediate family at the table and kept their doors open to family and friends. The sounds of Cuban music and the aroma of food drifted through the small place, filling it with life. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a cherished home."
1678	13504	5	3	"The author creates a strong sense of unity and happiness when explaining how she had grown in her home, her neighborhood, and with her parents. Narciso first begins by telling us about where she grew up and how she was brought up in a specific environment. She says that she was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey, and that she had lived in a traditional Cuban home, for which she is deeply thankful for her Cuban roots. Then Narciso continues by telling us about how there was a great sense of unity and ""family"" growing up where she did. She elaborates that she grew in a neighborhood where everyone was considered one big family, sharing in each other's lives. Towards the end Narciso tells us how much she is grateful for her parents and their love and sacrifice, which were central to her upbringing. Throughout the whole memoir, Narciso's main focus remains on how she grew, her Cuban roots, her gratefulness for her parents, and last of all her own definition of a real ""family"" built on love and community."
1679	13505	5	3	"I think the mood the author created in the memoir is one of love. Throughout the memoir, he talks about his parents immigrating, his new home, and the many people that were always at his house. This shows their immense love, and his parents' selflessness in creating a welcoming space. He portrayed his parents as genuinely caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone who entered their lives. Rodriguez says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" illustrating their open-hearted nature. They seemed to consistently put other people before themselves, and to always surround themselves with people who they love, and to love them in return, creating an enduring atmosphere of affection."
1680	13506	5	3	The mood of the memoir is grateful and thankful, and it is something @CAPS1 @CAPS1 will never forget, just as he will always remember the comfort of his home. The author reflects on the profound sense of appreciation for the life and love he experienced, which left a permanent and positive mark on him. This feeling of gratitude is central to his recollections, defining his memories of the past and the enduring warmth provided by his family and their home.
1681	13507	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the author was feeling grateful and homesick. Narciso explains that he is grateful for his parents and what they did for him, reflecting on the warmth and security they provided. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their own culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" This shared responsibility in the kitchen not only fed the family but also fostered a deep, enduring connection to his heritage and home, a feeling that he carries with him even now."
1682	13508	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" made me feel like I was in their kitchen eating Cuban food, and listen to music. Also, he told the life of a cuban immigrant. My grandfather followed the same path. He was a young boy when his family immigrated from Cuba. But he worked his hardest and became a very succesful man. This story completely reminds me of him and since I have some background with this, I know this ""mood"" and it speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The American Dream,"" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person. Finally, the mood he created shows that if you put your mind too it you could accomplish anything, a testament to perseverance and hope. Also, it shows the mood created in a typical cuban home, filled with the sounds, smells, and spirit of a resilient culture."
1683	13509	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is being thankful. Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for his parents giving him a loving home in New Jersey. The author created a mood that the reader should be thankful for their parents, emphasizing the foundational role they play. The sacrifice and love of anyones parents (like Rodriguez's) is what you should be most thankful for, as it forms the bedrock of one's character and future opportunities, a sentiment that resonates deeply throughout his recollections.
1684	13510	5	3	That he was happy. He relizes he has a better life in America than what he would of had in Cuba, appreciating the opportunities and safety it afforded him. But he still lived in a house that was like a Cuban house, where the traditions, language, and familial customs of his homeland were preserved and cherished daily, allowing him to maintain a strong connection to his roots while building a new future.
1685	13511	5	3	"In the memoir ""Growing Up"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is friendly. Anybody was allowed to stay at his house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents were ready to take anyone in because they knew they also would, creating an atmosphere of unconditional welcome. Their community had a strong bond. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" The neighbors in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was life in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Getting with family and celebrating was the theme of their home. The community loved and cared for each other in the neighborhood, forging a shared identity built on mutual support and respect."
1686	13512	5	3	The mood created by the author of the memoir is a mellow, unintense and subdued almost sad mood emphasized by the hardships the Rodriguez family faced in their struggle to give their children a better life. Although slightly depressing, the mood is happy and in a way, cheerful when the author describes how kind and welcoming the Rodriguez family is in paragraph four, highlighting their generous spirit. But, the memoir creates the depressing mood in a later paragraph due to the explanations of the families struggles in moving to a new country and what they had to give up in order to selflessly better their childrens life, which adds a layer of somber reflection. Over all, between the cheerful mood of the memoir and the sad mood of the memoir, the memoir generates a mellow, calm and serene mood throughout the article, creating a balanced and reflective tone.
1687	13513	5	3	The mood created by the author in this story is a very strong and happy one. They emigrated from Cuba to a new life in the United States and they were hoping for a better life for their kids than the life that they had, which filled them with a sense of hopeful purpose. This hopeful purpose for their children's future is a key reason why the overall mood was happy and optimistic, despite the challenges they undoubtedly faced during such a significant transition.
1688	13514	5	3	"In the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the writing is grateful. The two main examples of what Narciso is grateful for are his heritage and his family. Narciso is very grateful for his heritage and is a proud Cuban. I know this because in one paragraph he talks about how he loves Cuban food, cooking, and music and how he is grateful for all of them, which are vibrant expressions of his culture. Another thing that Narciso is extremely grateful for is his family. His family moved up to New Jersey before he was born so that their children could have a better life. They have sacrificed so much for their children including social and financial sacrifices, leaving behind their familiar world. In another paragraph, Narciso writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Any sane human being would be grateful to have parents that did what Narciso's parents did for him. As now evident, the main focus and mood of this excerpt from Rodriguez's memoirs is that he is grateful for these foundational gifts."
1689	13515	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez is a clothing designer who wrote a memoir for the collection ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The mood created in this memoir is a warm feeling that surrounds the meaning of family and home. Narciso says in the memoir, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" That proves that Narciso's house was a warm family home, that was always welcoming. Narciso's community was also close like a family. In another part it proves this when saying ""Close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extend a hand to people who were clearly in need"". He also states that blood doesn't mean your family, as illustrated by his surrogate grandparents. In a further section he proves that his parents were always welcoming, noting ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This reinforces the pervasive theme of warmth and inclusive love."
1690	13516	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed, and happy. His life so far in New Jersey must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, about passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen, creating a lively and sensory-rich atmosphere. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life, a fact he reflects upon with deep emotion. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home through their effort and care. Then, how it was in New Jersey he learned the real definition of the word ""family"", and how to love, etc. In conclusion, the memoir jumped from overjoyed and happy into very serious and real, effectively capturing the complex layers of his immigrant family experience."
1691	13517	5	3	In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso seems to get a certain mood toward his parents, a mood of happiness and gratefulness. Throughout the whole memoir, Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for everything they have done and gave up just for him to have a better life. His parents gave up their jobs, their houses, they left their family there, their friends, and in return they go to America to give their son a better life, which he is constantly saying how grateful and how honored he is to have parents who will give up everything they had for him. He reflects on their immense sacrifices with a profound sense of appreciation, recognizing the difficult journey they undertook. Over all, throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez sets a mood of happiness and gratefulness toward his loving parents, a sentiment that resonates deeply within his recollections.
1692	13518	5	3	"The mood in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* is happy and sympathetic. One reason is they never gave up no matter how hard it was. Narciso said that his parents ""drove them to endure these hard times,"" so, no matter how hard the times are they never gave up, demonstrating remarkable resilience. Another reason is they stayed very close with their family. The author wrote, ""all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table,"" this shows that their whole family was very close to each other, sharing meals and support. My final reason is that the Rodriguez's always wanted to help. Narciso said, ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open,"" which shows that they always wanted to help people in need, extending their kindness beyond their immediate family. The mood in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* is therefore happy and sympathetic, shaped by these enduring family values."
1693	13519	5	3	"The mood in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness. For example, in paragraph one it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows how Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for loving cooking, a skill and his eternal gratitude. Also, in paragraph two it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Narciso Rodriguez is happy that he grew up in New Jersey and how grateful he is to them for passing down their traits and loves to him and all their hard work, which created a warm and loving environment. This deep sense of thankfulness for his upbringing and the values instilled in him defines the overall tone of the memoir."
1694	13520	5	3	"The author created a heartfelt mood in the memoir. The mood the author created was a grateful mood. In the memoir it states ""skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" This quote makes me feel grateful for my culture and heritage, appreciating the lasting gifts passed down. This story also makes me feel proud. In the story it states ""My Mother and father had come to this country with such courage"". I feel so proud that they wanted to leave to come have a better life, showcasing their determination and hope. Lastly, the mood is happy. This story is happy because he learns a good lesson and he is proud of his parents and culture, culminating in a positive and uplifting reflection on his family's journey and legacy."
1695	13521	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a combination of calm, nice, and happy. It could also be described as heavenly. Narciso refers to his childhood like it was one happy dream. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". He also mentions how grateful he is to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" he writes, acknowledging their foundational role in his life. One last fact that contributes to the mood of this memoir is Narciso's view on family. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"". From this excerpt it is clear that the author cherishes this time and would love to go back, as these memories represent an ideal of community and belonging that defines his happy past."
1696	13522	5	3	The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is one of profound gratefulness. When I read this, I feel thankful like the author, deeply appreciating the sacrifices made. Although his family had a good life in Cuba, they courageously left to give their kids a better life and future. If the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I think the mood would be entirely different and less appreciative. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless, for that reason, anyway, and the narrative's tone would shift. If my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would want people to feel grateful as well for such a significant sacrifice. It is clear that Narciso Rodriguez understands how hard it was for his parents to start over. Another mood that emerges could be guilt, which is a powerful secondary feeling. I feel guilty when I read this because I don't always thank my parents or appreciate them as I should. Ultimately, Narciso Rodriguez created a lot of complex and resonant moods in the memoir, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
1697	13523	5	3	"In the memoir, the mood, or how the article made me feel, was deeply grateful and reflective. Narciso Rodriguez wrote this memoir almost as a thank you letter to his parents, expressing his heartfelt appreciation. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" is a line that powerfully captures this sentiment. The author uses words that portait the mood of thankfullness, like ""eternaly grateful"" in one paragraph, or ""I will always be gratefull"" in another, which reinforces the central theme. Narciso Rodriguez describes all of the sacrifices that were made and all the hardships lived through by his parents with great respect. He describes their coming to America selflessly and beginning anew all so that their children could have a better life, as detailed in a later paragraph. When I read this memoir, it reminded me of all of the things my parents have done so that I may be happy and so that I can have a home of my own, making the author's gratitude feel universal and deeply personal."
1698	13524	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez, the author of the memoir, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a profoundly comforting one. This is shown, for instance, by his reccolection of his childhood in his family's home being fond and filled with warmth. For example, he states that he is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents passing on, ""their rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" that he claims to still have and cherish today. Also, he remembers life as being neighborly and treating neighbors and friends as part of their family with kindness and sharing, which adds to the comforting atmosphere. This is shown when Narciso says, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In addition the comforting feeling is shown when Narciso says, ""I learned here about how to love.... My parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that Narciso had a great place to grown up in and has fond and comforting memories of it that shaped who he became."
1699	13525	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is humble and deeply appreciative. He loves his home alot, recalling it with great affection. He loves the scent and the music and culture in his house, which created a vibrant atmosphere. In the memoir he stated that ""Passionate cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" evoking a strong sense of place. The mood in the memoir is also touching and emotionally resonant. He say that his mom is so helping and opening to family members in need, showing great compassion. He had stated that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" highlighting their generosity. Another example of mood from the memoir is how he explains how close his community is, creating a sense of unity. He states that all the cultures and ethicitys came together in great friendship, which was inspiring. The mood the author created in the memoir is touching, humble and inspiring, leaving the reader with a positive and heartfelt impression."
1700	13526	5	3	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is characterized by grateful appreciation and warm friendship. The first example shows how Narciso was very grateful for the cooking skills passed down, noting that it is still with me today, and for which I am eternally grateful. That means that Narciso liked their cooking and is very grateful for this enduring gift. The memoir also shows that Narciso is very friendship-oriented with his Parents and his community, emphasizing strong bonds. He describes how ""All of these cultures came together as a family,"" illustrating a deep sense of community. In the memeior by Narciso Rodriguez the two primary examples effectively demonstrate how Narciso felt both grateful and friendship, concluding that these interconnected moods define the heartfelt narrative of his family's experience."
1701	13527	5	3	"There are several distinct moods the author created in the memoir. First of all, the author creates this family full of love in a home that is loved by the family gathered up within it, emphasizing a sense of warmth and belonging. Also, the author talks about the relationship and connection they have to where they are from, highlighting their nationality and cultural roots. In addition, in the household, the family was living all over the place, in the basement and upstairs, almost everywhere, which contributes to a feeling of a bustling, lively environment. The best example the author talks about in the home is where the instances of love and support are from, showing the family's unity. As you can see, this home was a great one that made the word ""loved"" have the whole family in it, truly defining their experience. The overall impression is one of a deeply affectionate and inclusive family life."
1702	13528	5	3	"In the nonfiction memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author created a warm, busy, and giving mood. The mood is warm because in the memoir it says ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows there were a lot of friends and family together in this home, constantly interacting and showing friends and family being together in a close-knit setting. Also, the mood is busy because in the memoir it says ""countless extended family members came and went—and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". This shows how people were always coming and going in this home, creating a dynamic and active atmosphere. The mood was also giving. It was giving because in the memoir it says ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". This shows how people were giving when others needed help, offering support and kindness even if they were not the same kind. That is the multifaceted mood the author successfully conveyed in this memoir."
1703	13529	5	3	"The author's mood of the memoir is that the narrator is grateful because the narrator tells us how much he appreciates what his parents have done for him. He appreciates that his parents ""immigrated"" to the United States so he can have a ""better life,"" a central theme of his gratitude. The narrator said that ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" The narrator is profoundly grateful that his parents made that significant sacrifice for him. Furthermore, the narrator is happy that his parents made their house feel as if they were still in Cuba, the country they originally came from, preserving their heritage. The narrator said that the ""Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love,"" creating a joyful and nostalgic atmosphere. The narrator is thankful for the ""sacrifice"" that his parents needed to make, acknowledging the difficulties they endured. The narrator is so grateful that he can't fully ""express his gratitude"" in words for their actions. The author thanks his parents for what they've done to make him happy and to provide him with opportunities. That is how deeply grateful the author is towards what his parents did to ensure they had a better life, and through this experience, the narrator has learned what the word ""family"" truly means, encompassing sacrifice, love, and unwavering support."
1704	13530	5	3	"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usually even think of mingling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth, nobody cared about race and every person in his neighborhood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity or background. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is shown is by describing all of his acquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each other's doors and immediately be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would your own family. Finally, and possibly the most extreme way that the family showed their extraordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""...arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremely close they were to everyone they knew, offering unconditional hospitality. Whether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family, the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind, creating a powerful mood of unity and belonging."
1705	13531	5	3	The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, is very happy and uplifting. The whole story is an optimistic view of Narciso's childhood, focusing on positive memories and familial love. None of the bad parts of his childhood are written about, which maintains this consistent positive tone throughout the narrative. He writes about his parents coming from Cuba and how some of his family would come and eat with them, sharing meals and creating fond memories. Narciso's memoir is a happy look back at his childhood, filled with gratitude and affection. Narciso is very grateful for his family, specifically his parents. They came from Cuba to America to start a good life for their son, a decision that frames the entire memoir. This causes the beginning of this memoir to start off with a happy, uplifting mood of hope and sacrifice. As the memoir progresses, it still maintains the same happy mood, never deviating into sorrow or regret. The description of family gatherings is a great example of how the mood created by the author is so happy. It talks about how Narciso's family would go to their house and share meals with them, filled with conversation and laughter. Narciso was happy to be around his family, and this joy is palpable in his writing. The best example of the mood created by Narciso is the final paragraph, which talks about Narciso's profound gratitude towards his parents. He loves them so much for coming to America and leaving their promising jobs in Cuba to give Narciso a better life, a sentiment that resonates deeply. The final paragraph talks about how Narciso's whole family turned a house into a home, which is a very happy and conclusive thought to complete the overall happy mood of the story. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is extremely happy, as there are no mad or sad parts of his childhood mentioned in the memoir, ensuring a consistently positive reflection.
1706	13532	5	3	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" the mood in this story is very happy and heartwarming. When the author talks about how they have their own cultures and live in the kitchen, and how they sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and leaves you wishing you were there. The different immigrants that live in the neighborhood, who are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working, makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents gave up everything like their house, their food, Cuba, and everything else they left behind, all just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives, and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that, especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their landlord; they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you, which ultimately makes the overall mood of the story a happy one."
1707	13533	5	3	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a distinct mood in his memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The mood of this memoir could be described as nostalgic or even loving to some extent, as in loving his old home, family, and friends. The author mentions ""endless celebrations ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This helps create the mood because the author is reminiscing on the events that happened in his home, which in this case were very happy memories. The author mentions that during a time of racism in the country, his community was so close-knit that people were like family. He even states: ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These examples from the memoir help create a nostalgic mood, and it also shows the love that was present throughout the community. Finally, the author says he ""will never forget"" the things he ""learned there about how to love,"" which builds on these two themes as well, due to the fact he is remembering the feeling of love he experienced and learned. In conclusion, the mood of this story would be one of nostalgic reflection and love."
1708	13534	5	3	In the passage, the author provided a good and uplifting mood. For example, he talked a lot about love, friendship, and other related things that contribute to a positive atmosphere. He talked about the differences between a home and a house, emphasizing the emotional connections that define a true home. He made this passage for people to start thinking about what love really is and what people will really do for each other in the name of that love. He is a very good author who successfully conveys these heartfelt themes, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and contemplation about the important things in life.
1709	13535	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, an internationally recognized clothing designer, offers the following definition of ""family.""

Even though he had to work and he was an immigrant, he found a way to be happy. The primary reason he was happy was because he was with his family, and that is what is most important to him. He was from Cuba and immigrated from Cuba to the United States, which was a significant life change.

First, in the memoir Narciso describes his home enough to give the reader a sense of hominess. There are many examples of this in the memoir.

In the text it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This quote shows his family took care of everyone even though they did not have much themselves, demonstrating a profound generosity. Another example of mood is being together; Narciso's family helped out all immigrants to get back on their feet. Another part of the text says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Narciso's family helped the less fortunate very often, fostering a strong community spirit. The mood of this story is very inviting and peaceful, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and communal harmony."
1714	13540	5	3	"The mood created by the author is described in many ways. First, he described a friendly mood.

1715	13541	5	3	In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, he tells about how his parents immigrated from Cuba to The United States so that he could have a better life. He tells of how he will always be grateful for his Cuban culture that stayed with him his whole life, and for the selflessness of his parents. The mood that he sets in this memoir is gratefulness. When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind, sacrificing their own comfort for his future. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, his family still found a way to have a home, creating a space filled with love and tradition. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave him a sense of family even though his real family was very far away. He is grateful for this because he will always have his Cuban culture because that's what he was raised with, a heritage that shaped his identity. The overall mood he created was gratefulness, a deep and abiding thankfulness for the sacrifices and the culture that defined his upbringing.
1716	13542	5	3	"In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture and how deeply it was woven into their daily life. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life, providing a foundation for his identity. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author, a tone of fond remembrance and peaceful reflection on his formative years."
1717	13543	5	3	"I think the mood created by the author was very warm, greatful and happy. I think this because he often expresses how his parents sacrificed a lot of things and made his childhood ful of joyous memories, ensuring he felt loved and secure. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In many paragraphs he explains how he admires them for their strength and perseverance in moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1, leaving behind their established lives. I also said happy because he is happy that his childhood was so memorable and filled with positive experiences. ""Innocence of childhood... endless celebrations."" This shows me that he enjoyed the parties and being a kid, growing up in that household where joy was a constant presence. This is why I think the mood is so grateful and happy, reflecting a deep appreciation for his past."
1718	13544	5	3	The mood created by the author overall is gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some events in his life you notice he mostly talks about his family and the values they instilled in him. He says that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, what matters is love and the bonds you create. Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacraficed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get, demonstrating their dedication. Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family through their actions. It saw what courage it took for his parents to turn the simple house they once had into a home for him, a home filled with love and security despite their humble circumstances.
1719	13545	5	3	"In the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" her mood is love, because she loves her parents for all the sacrifices they made, just so Narcisco can have a better life. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" She means she will always be grateful for what her parents done for her in her childhood to make her become what she is now, acknowledging their profound influence. Another example, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" She means that her parents sacrificed to turn a @NUM1 room apartment into her home, filling it with warmth and love that transcended its physical limitations, which is the core of her loving and appreciative mood."
1720	13546	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez set a strong mood of happieness and thankfullness in his memoir. One way he did this is by thanking his parents for passing on their culinary skills to him, a gift that has lasted a lifetime. He says in the memoir that he is ""eternally grateful"" and still has a love of cooking, which connects him to his heritage. Another way he set this mood was by explaining how nice his neighborhood was, describing a supportive community. He said that all the different cultures came together in solidarity and friendship and everyone was hardworking, creating a positive environment. A third way he did this was by saying how great his parents were, highlighting their specific qualities. He said he was greatful for their love and sacrifice, their strength and perseverance, and their courageousness in starting a new life. Narciso Rodriguez said a happy and thankful mood in his memoir through these detailed recollections of his blessings."
1721	13547	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir was very positive and warm, showing gratitude, and promoting the real definition of family. An example of his gratitude towards his parents is when he states: ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This early lesson in sharing and collaboration extended beyond the kitchen. Narciso describes his sense of true family in paragraph @NUM1 when he says: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" He elaborates that his parents were very courageous coming to @LOCATION1 having no previous knowledge of the culture or language. He expresses how thankful he is for his parents to come to @LOCATION1, leaving everything they knew behind, in order to give him a better life. He describes his neighborhood being a true family, adding big dinners together, and helping one another in times of need, which reinforced this broader concept of kinship. His profound appreciation is captured in the lines: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done... I think them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood of the memoir truly does demonstrate the importance of family, love, warmth, and gratefulness, leaving a lasting impression of thankfulness."
1722	13548	5	3	"This is the mood created by the author in this memoir. In this memoir the author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". One reason why this describes the author's mood is that it shows that through all the great times he's had with his family, they have giving him an experience of a life time that he will never forget. These experiences, filled with love and shared moments, are what imbued the physical structure with a deeper, emotional significance. Another reason why this shows the author's mood is that now that his parents have died and he misses them the only memory he has of them is this house he calls home. The house stands as a tangible reminder of their presence and the life they built together, making it a sanctuary of memory. That is how the author describes his mood a lot in this memoir, conveying a deep sense of nostalgic love and poignant loss intertwined."
1723	13549	5	3	"In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author sets a very grateful and loving tone. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents left everything they ever had behind, to make his life easier, demonstrating a profound act of selflessness. This whole excerpt is thanking them for that courageous decision and the values they imparted. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso ends with ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much he loves them and cherishes the life they created. He could've had a big house where his family lived, but it wouldn't be home. Instead, he had a small house where everybody shared things and supported one another, which is what truly made it a home. He could really call it home because of the love within its walls. In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the author sets the tone of gratefulness and loving, which resonates deeply with the reader. I can relate to this story because it reminds me of my family and the similar values we hold dear."
1724	13550	5	3	"The mood created by the author is a grateful mood. It's grateful because the boy kept on talking about how thankful he is for all the stuff he has, recognizing the value not of material wealth but of the intangible gifts of love and community. Another reason why the mood is grateful is because all of the people in the neighborhood will all come together and eat with each other, visit with each other, and help each other, creating a strong, supportive network that felt like an extended family. I know the mood is grateful because it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This direct statement of thankfulness is reinforced by the descriptions of communal living and shared experiences, which collectively paint a picture of deep and sincere appreciation for his upbringing and the people in it."
1725	13551	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is talking about this boy's life and about his parents and what they do for a living and what they are and how they are nice to other people. Their kindness and the positive environment they fostered are central to the narrative. I think the authors mood would be like happy, reflecting on a childhood filled with warmth and security. The tone is nice and caring on other people and not being rude, emphasizing empathy and compassion. Its all about caring, and love, happiness, which are the foundational elements that defined his early years and shaped his outlook on life, family, and community, concluding with a heartfelt appreciation for such a nurturing upbringing.
1726	13552	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: Blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author stretches the importance of family and the profound idea that it is built on love rather than blood. The mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates is a comfortable, loving, homey feeling. He states that he grows up learning that ""family has nothing to do with being a blood relative"". He says that his family welcomed everybody, creating an atmosphere of unconditional acceptance. Strangers that needed help, neighbors, and extended family were all embraced equally. He creates a loving mood when he said he lived in a ""close-knit community"". He also says ""These cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" highlighting the unity he experienced. Furthermore, when he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" you can sense his deep appreciation and feel the comforting atmosphere they cultivated. Those were the distinct and heartfelt moods I felt while reading this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, leaving one with a lasting sense of warmth and belonging."
1727	13553	5	3	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, his mood is very meaningful and deeply sincere. You can tell that what he's saying he really means it, he's genuinely sincere in his recollections. He says ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"" in paragraph @NUM1 line @NUM2, emphasizing the kitchen's role as a central gathering place. In paragraph @NUM2 line @NUM4 he says ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need,"" illustrating the community's generous spirit. Or when he tells us that his first friend was his babysitter @PERSON2 who was his landlord's daughter, showing how his family connections extended naturally to those around them. Narciso Rodriguez tells us how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" in paragraph @NUM5 line @NUM6. He tells us in paragraph @NUM7 second line how his mother and father ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" even if it did mean leaving behind their loved ones, and things they loved, a sacrifice he clearly acknowledges. In the last sentence of his memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" With those last words from Narciso Rodriguez you know that he is sincere about what he's saying and that he could never fully thank his parents for what they did for him, a sentiment that resonates with profound gratitude."
1728	13554	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very satisfactory and engaging one. The author uses a satisfactory tone, too, especially when the author is explaining what a family is and how it is defined by shared experiences.

Narciso is talking a lot in this memoir about his great family memories of all his friends and family coming over for dinner and his mother cooking in the kitchen traditional Cuban food while listening to traditional Cuban music, painting a vivid picture of a lively and loving household. He learned that friends and family members are there to love and spend time with, and this lesson is conveyed with a tone of heartfelt appreciation for the simple yet profound moments that built his character and his understanding of home.

He also shows how happy he is and how grateful he is of his Parents. He paints a picture with words in the opening paragraphs, where he says, ""My parents were originally from Cuba, and they came here and I was born in a simple house in Jersey. In my house there was beautiful Cuban music and cooking going on; we always had family over and neighbors."" He paints a nice, soothing picture of a vibrant and welcoming home. In the story he also talks about the unity of his neighborhood, made up of mostly spanish immigrants, which contributed to his sense of belonging. He talks about that in a later section of the memoir. This shows you how happy and content he was during his upbringing. In many places in the story he also says how grateful he is to his parents and how much courage they had to make the trip to a new country, highlighting their strength and sacrifice.

1735	13561	5	3	The narrator is describing the life he grew up in, painting a vivid picture of his formative years.

He was trying to create a warm happy mood by describing how his parents try to help other people and do the best they could with anything they had, embodying a spirit of selflessness and community. Showing greatness in life when you barely have much yourself is the powerful and uplifting message that defines the overall mood of his nostalgic reflection.
1736	13562	5	3	The mood created by the author is one of gratitude and duty. I believe this because you can tell that the narrator doesn't take anything for granted, appreciating the opportunities provided. I know this because the narrator's parents was given a house, and since the narrator was part of the family, it was her duty to make that house a home as much as possible with her parents, contributing to the family effort. I Know this because it explicitly states it in the text, specifically in paragraph one, and again in paragraph two. The author also gives a proud mood in this memoir. I feel this because in paragraph one, and paragraph four it clearly conveys that the narrator is Cuban and italian, from Newark, New Jersey, and the narrator seems to be proud of who she is and where she is from, embracing her heritage fully. I know all of this is true because its all in the text, supporting this interpretation of the author's intended tone.
1737	13563	5	3	"In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood after he describes the hardships his family faced to give him a better life, detailing their journey.""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" The author feels thankful of what he has and deeply appreciates what his parents did for him, recognizing their immense effort. This sets an happy mood because he is happy of what he has and wouldn't give anything to replace it, content with his life.

That is the clear and consistent mood created by the author in the memoir, leaving the reader with a sense of warmth and satisfaction.
1739	13565	5	3	"According to the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a distinct mood throughout the memoir. The mood was happiness because Narciso was genuinely happy with his life and upbringing. One example of Narciso's happiness is with his home. When he's telling about the apartment he grow up in the mood is happy and fond. Although it wasn't much his parents made him comfortable in it, providing a loving environment. They made it seem like Cuba as much as they could, preserving their culture. Narciso loved his apartment even if it wasn't Cuba, appreciating it deeply. In paragraph two ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" He was happy with the apartment because his parents made it feel like a Cuban home to him, a place of belonging. Another example of Narciso's happiness is with his family. Narciso tells how his friends seem like family, extending his circle of love. In paragraph four ""Our landlord and his daughter... do the same for us."" Even though the people aren't blood related to him he's still happy with them, valuing these close relationships.

1740	13566	5	3	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez From Home: The blueprints of our lives the author sets a sad mood in this memoir, reflecting on difficult times. An example of the sad mood set is when the author describes his neighborhood. The author describes his neighbor hood by saying ""our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, cuban and Italian immigrants."" (Paragraph 1) This show they live in a run down neighborhood because most immigrants are poor when they arrived at the United States, facing economic challenges. Another example is when he describes his family's situation. The author say's ""There was often someone staying with us temporarly until they were able to get back on their feet"". (Paragraph 2) This shows the poverty that they lived around because they had to put shelter around those who couldn't aford it, highlighting shared struggles. The last way the author creates a sad mood is by describing the sacrifice of his parents, The author say's ""The Faith that this would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"". (Paragraph 3) This is a sad mood because it shows how their hope and hard work back fired and they didn't have a very happy time, enduring hardship. That is why I think the tone of this memoir is a sad one, marked by these reflections on struggle and sacrifice."
1741	13567	5	3	"The mood of this memoir was very happy and peaceful, evoking a sense of warm contentment. @CAPS1 seems like he's a very happy person, and his writing reflects a deep-seated gratitude for his life experiences. This is clearly shown in his statement, ""and for which I am eternally grateful,"" which underscores his appreciative nature. @CAPS1 and his parents let anyone that was ""family"" in, creating an environment of inclusive warmth and belonging that defined his upbringing. This open-door policy for loved ones consistently reinforced the memoir's overall uplifting and serene atmosphere."

1743	13569	5	3	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is peaceful because the whole memoir is talking about love and care for each other and your family, establishing a gentle and reflective tone. In this memoir, there are many times where the author discusses his love for cooking, which serves as a central theme for his cherished memories. ""It was the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote shows that Cuban feasts caused him to experience life and love with his family and loved ones in a profound way. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family"". This proves that his life in New Jersey at his house helped him realize the true meaning of family through daily rituals and togetherness. The last quote that made this memoir peaceful was when he said, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where I learned many things there about how to love.

1744	13570	5	3	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez was appreciation, or that's what I got out of it, as a profound sense of thankfulness resonates throughout the text. Throughout the whole memoir, Narciso's affectionate language and explanation of his life and his parents was constant and grasping, drawing the reader into his world of gratitude. In paragraph two, he uses parentheses as if his gratitude is so strong that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is, adding a personal and emphatic touch. He set the scene with new experiences and inspiration, which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to, highlighting their pivotal role.

The reason why it is peaceful is because there is no fighting in this story at all, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and safety. This story is loving because throughout the whole thing the only thing that I learned about was how to respect and love each other, a lesson woven into every memory. There are many examples of this in the text, where characters interact with kindness and mutual support, as illustrated in paragraph @NUM1 and paragraph @NUM2. This is the tone of the story, one that leaves the reader with a profound sense of warmth and contentment.

It was also a big thank you to his parents for everything they did for him, serving as a heartfelt tribute to their influence. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and Sacrifice."" The author is trying to get his point (of gratefulness) across to, not only the reader, but everyone in his life, but it seems that at some point he's lost for words, overwhelmed by the depth of his emotion. ""@CAPS1 often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the Spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The way the author explains everything puts you in the same mood is him, creating a powerful empathetic connection. He seemed to feel the same peaceful, yet loving, and grateful mood flow over you as well, making the reading experience deeply immersive.

1756	13582	5	3	"The mood created by the author of the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of our Lives* in the memoir was one of love, happiness, and old memories of home. In paragraph seven it states ""... I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house..."" That shows how much he loved his home, even though it wasn't perfect, cherishing the simple moments within its walls. Also in paragraph four he says ""..our landlord and his daughter Alegria—my first friend..."" Narciso tells about his first friend, highlighting the personal connections that made the place significant. But the tone that gives the best mood of the story is the memory that Narciso shares when he says ""... I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home..."". In paragraph seven, this sentiment is powerfully reinforced, illustrating that the true value of the home came from the love and life his family brought into it, a feeling of profound gratitude and warmth that defines the memoir's overall mood."
1757	13583	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and thankful mood. The reason it is a happy and thankful mood is that he talks about his family and how they sacrificed so much just for him. For example; ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship."" Another thing is that he also learned what family really means through their example. For example; ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This deep appreciation for his family's sacrifices and the lessons in love they imparted is what ultimately creates the heartfelt, thankful mood that permeates the entire narrative."
1758	13584	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in the memoir from *Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives* is a happy and thankful mood. This is because of the happy memories Rodriguez describes in his memoir, the gratitude he expresses for his family in the end, and his description of the hardships his family had to endure for him. First, Rodriguez brings a happy mood into the story because of the many happy memories he describes during the memoir. One of them is when he says ""The passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" evoking a sensory-rich and joyful atmosphere. Second, the gratitude he expresses for his family in the last two paragraphs conveys a thankful mood. For example, Rodriguez says, ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Third, by describing the hardships his family had to endure for him, Rodriguez further conveys a thankful mood.

In the end, because of the happy memories described, his gratitude expressed for his family, and the description of hardships his family had to face, Rodriguez successfully conveys a happy and thankful mood throughout his personal recollection."
1759	13585	5	3	"In the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the narrator had shown happiness throughout the memoir. One example of when the author showed happiness was when they were thinking about cooking. They admired when their parents helped and taught them how to cook, creating a foundation of skill and shared joy. They would hear the music in the back that they adored as their heritage or background, which added to the festive and comforting environment. In the story it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking."" When the author still lived with their parents, their relatives would come over to eat and have fun, making the house a vibrant hub of family life. To reflect back on those memories made the author happy. In the story it says, ""Countless extended family members came and went-- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet."" Another example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to a new location. They thought of how lucky their parents were to come to such a nice place, recognizing the courage behind the decision. In the story it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" These reflections on family, food, and sacrifice collectively generate the overarching mood of happiness and deep appreciation in the narrative."
1760	13586	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very thankful. Again and again, the author thanks his parents for several of the things that they gave to him that he still values. First, he thanks them for passing on their love of cooking and music which he says he is ""eternally grateful"" for and which he ""adores to this day."" He is thankful for how they brought him up, showing this by writing how much he still enjoys these things today as a lasting part of his identity. Next, Narciso Rodriguez says how he ""will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He describes how they did so much to give their child a better life, detailing their immense personal sacrifices. They sacrificed their laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in a new city to give their children more opportunity. His parents left behind ""their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Furthermore, they did all of this with ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" The parents sacrificed so much because they wanted so badly for their children to have a good life, and for this profound gift of opportunity and love, Narciso Rodriguez is extremely grateful, a sentiment that defines the entire tone of his writing."
1761	13587	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is to show profound gratefulness towards the author's parents. He wanted to portray the fact that his parents sacrificed their lives for the author's life, a theme central to his reflections. Narciso repeatedly conveys the message that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", but was instead about people who care for one another; people who ""come together in great solidarity and friendship"". The most important family to Narciso are his parents who made immense sacrifices, in order ""to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for this profound act. He admits ""that what they did was a much more courageous thing than ""he"" could have ever done"", acknowledging their superior bravery. Narciso, in fact, cannot thank his parents enough for showing them how important family and friends are through their own selfless actions. In the end, @PERSON1 realizes that a home is a place you live, and celebrate birthdays, and do work, but mainly a place where everyone is welcome and a home is a family in itself, a lesson learned from his parents' example."
1762	13588	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir was described passionately and emotionally, suffusing the entire narrative with a deep sense of warmth. The mood in this whole memoir was one of overwhelming gratefulness, a sentiment that colors every recollection. This feeling starts from the beginning with how his family passed on their traditions, creating a strong sense of identity and belonging. Also significant was having people around him, family and friends who helped him, living close in reach and offering constant support. This was all made possible by his parents giving up everything from their past just to start a family with a better life, sacrificing all they had known and loved in their previous existence. His life was consequently filled with joy and happiness, a direct result of the loving foundation built by his family and the community of friends that surrounded him.
1763	13589	5	3	The mood the author creates is a prideful memoir of his life and home and what others did for him, while living in a time of hate and racism, which makes the positive aspects of his experience stand out even more. He feels foreverly grateful for the boundless love and profound sacrifice his parents showed to him, recognizing their efforts as the cornerstone of his well-being. He was happy and reassured that during these difficult times people of different cultures and ethnicities were treating all in the community like family, creating a sanctuary of acceptance. The mood and emotion of this memoir is one of pride and love for others and a deep sense of caring, illustrating how human connection can triumph over societal prejudice and create a true home.
1764	13590	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage, a theme that resonates deeply throughout his personal history. ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love & sacrifice,"" he writes, establishing the emotional core of his gratitude. ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" he admits, humbled by their actions. Another example of courage is how ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in a country they loved,"" a decision that required immense personal strength. This profound appreciation for their brave choice is the central mood the author creates in this memoir, framing their journey as the ultimate act of love and valor."
1765	13591	5	3	"In the story The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the @CAPS1 creates a distinct mood, and here is how that mood is established. The first mood is the one of her house, which is depicted as a vibrant and welcoming space. She describes friends and family gathered with Cuban music along with the food; here is one example of the food and music: ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen,"" creating a rich sensory experience. Another mood is that of extended family and friends, emphasizing a community bound by affection rather than just blood. An example of this is in paragraph four where it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family,"" demonstrating an inclusive and generous spirit. And those are some of the key reasons how the @CAPS1 set a warm and inclusive mood in The Blueprints of our lives, illustrating that home is built from love and openness."
1766	13592	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive one, filled with warmth and appreciation for his upbringing. The author tells how his parents immigrated from Cuba in 1956 and how he was born in 1961. Throughout his recollections, he never said one negative thing about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey, focusing instead on the richness of his family's culture. He mentioned how his parents had a deep love for cooking and that love was passed down to him, a gift for which he said that he was grateful. He also mentioned that, along with the cooking, was Passionate Cuban music that filled their home with rhythm and joy. He described his neighborhood as being a vibrant tapestry where ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" creating a supportive environment. As a final sentence, the author stated with heartfelt sentiment how we ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" a place of love and security."
1767	13593	5	3	In the memoir by @PERSON1, he seems to be very happy and content with his early life. He has a big family and @CAPS1 of friends and many good memories that he cherishes deeply. He comes from a very caring and sharing home where support and kindness were ever-present. The whole mood of the story is very uplifting, as it reflects on the joy found in family bonds and community. This positive recollection leaves the reader with a strong sense of the author's cherished past and the loving foundation upon which his life was built.
1768	13594	5	3	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood -- feeling, rather -- of belonging, ""home"", and comfort throughout his memoir. He recalls growing up in an apartment where ""countless extended family members came and went"" and his life was full of people from his community -- cousins, aunts, friends, all contributing to a lively atmosphere. Narciso recalls that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" -- and there is a profound sense of belonging that stems from this openness. Comfort is further illustrated by his description of ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" There's also a strong sense of thanks in this -- gratefulness, one could say, for the sacrifices made. Narciso's parents left everything behind when they immigrated to @LOCATION1 from Cuba -- and as he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And this -- all of this -- creates the enduring and heartfelt sense of ""home"" that defines his memories."
1769	13595	5	3	The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is grateful for the way his Cuban parents brought him up when they had so little to begin with, instilling in him strong values and a rich cultural heritage. @CAPS1 thing that the author is grateful for are the Cuban traditions that his family passed on to him, which provided a constant source of identity and joy. One of the traditions would be their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking, which filled their home with wonderful aromas and brought the family together. @CAPS1 thing the author is grateful for is that his mother and father came to this country to give him a better life even though it meant leaving behind family, friends, careers and the country they loved, a sacrifice he holds in the highest regard. That was the mood of profound gratitude created by the author in this memoir, a tribute to his parents' enduring love and resilience.
1770	13596	5	3	The mood the author created was one of adaptation and deep gratitude, highlighting how they were immigrants and they had to adjust to the @CAPS1 way of life while preserving their own cherished customs. Despite the challenges of a new country, they still celebrated his first birthdays in that very house, creating fond memories from the very start. The author expresses that they will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice, which provided a foundation of strength and security. It was a clear demonstration of how important family and friends are in navigating life's changes and building a new community. And that I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, a sentiment that perfectly concludes this reflection on family, love, and the meaning of home.
1771	13597	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive and grateful mood for his home, and his parents. One example of the mood created by the author is in paragraph @NUM1 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author is once again stating how thankful he is that his parents came to @LOCATION1, leaving behind their familiar life in Cuba. Another example of the mood of the story, is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" This highlights their primary motivation and the depth of their commitment. A final example of the mood created by the author, is when in paragraph @NUM3 he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" By saying this quote he means he is grateful for his parents sacrifice to come to @LOCATION1, but also being able to be raised in the traditional Cuban way. He also means that he had many great memories growing up in this home, and how they bonded together with their multi-racial neighbor's to battle through the tough times, sharing food and support. The memoir has a very positive, happy and cheerful mood about the Cuban family and their enduring spirit."
1772	13598	5	3	"The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family, built on love rather than obligation. The first example of this mood is in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @PERSON1 is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family, and that true kinship is chosen and nurtured. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what, creating a network of mutual care. A final example is when the author states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love."" The author is saying he is grateful for the people who showed him what ""family"" really is through their actions and generosity. In closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home through the love shared within its walls."
1773	13599	5	3	I would say the mood that the author was in was happy and deeply appreciative. I would say that because he always has something nice to say about his upbringing and his parents. He never gets into fights with his mother or father, instead focusing on the harmony of their home life. He talks about how he is grateful for their guidance and the stable foundation they provided for him. He explains how he would never argue with his parents out of respect for their sacrifices. How he's always had a good life from when he was a kid to now when he is an @CAPS1, carrying forward the values instilled in him. He was going to move into a new @NUM1 bedroom apartment soon, hoping to build his own life. That way he can call it his home, just as his parents did for him, thus continuing the cycle of creating a loving and positive space.
1774	13600	5	3	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The @CAPS1 of our Lives"" it tells us about a kid from Cuba who immigrated with his family. This memoir has a positive mood, emphasizing community and sacrifice. It says that they keep family or friends in their home until they get back on their feet, offering a safe haven for those in need. It tells us about the neighborhood he lived in, a vibrant and diverse community. And how there's many different types of immigrants there and how they all get along, supporting one another. The kid's parents have friends and family over for dinner, filling the house with laughter and conversation. The parents gave up everything—their jobs, friends, and families back in Cuba—so that their kid could grow up in @LOCATION1 with greater opportunities. This selfless act is central to the memoir's heartfelt and uplifting tone."
1775	13601	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a nice ""homie"" feeling, a sense of warmth and belonging. The author tries to let you know a home is more than physical walls; it is a place for relationships are made and memories are shared. He illustrates this with ""The congregation of family and friends,"" which was a regular occurrence. This is significant because all of the good times and celebrations occurred with the people he loved in his home, from birthdays to simple Sunday gatherings. The author tries to show the love and affection that permeated throughout his home, describing how his mother ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" The author shows the love that goes on throughout his home, making it a true sanctuary where everyone felt welcomed and valued, which defines the comforting mood of the entire piece."
1776	13602	5	3	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a very happy and loving mood. As it says in the memoir ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This means he is happy and loves his parents have done, appreciating their efforts deeply. It also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance"". He loves his parents and is happy with what they have done, recognizing their enduring commitment. The last thing the memoir says is ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This meant he was very thankful for what they have done, valuing the warmth they created. Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, has a happy and loving mood. This happy and loving mood is expressed throughout the memoir, defining his cherished memories."
1777	13603	5	3	"It creates a mood of happiness ""but Cuban music filled the air as it mixed with the aromas of the kitchen."" this shows what his home was like, a place full of sensory joy. The lively sounds and the inviting smells combined to create a vibrant and cheerful atmosphere. This description paints a picture of a home that was not just a physical space but a center of cultural and familial warmth. The mood is one of pure contentment and nostalgic delight, stemming directly from these rich, remembered experiences. Ultimately, this memory perfectly captures the essence of a happy and loving home environment."
1778	13604	5	3	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is the appreciation through the author's parents. Another mood is the happiness of ""home"" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author is grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice and courage, which established a foundation of security. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how welcomed refugees that just arrived to the country were at their house to stay, that the ""warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love"" made her learn the definition of ""family"". This act of hospitality extended the family's warmth beyond its immediate members, reinforcing a mood of generous love and communal happiness that defined the author's understanding of home."
1779	13605	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" the mood created by the author is that his parents were loving and caring. His parents were loving and caring because they made their house into a home, infusing it with affection. His parents were selfless and caring when they come to the United States, facing many new challenges. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This shows his parents were loving and made sacrafices for their children to have a good life, putting their family first. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""they struggled both personally and financially"". This shows they cared about their family because they sacraficed things to struggle & make their family happy, enduring hardships for their sake. In conclusion, the mood is being caring and loving, a testament to his parents' devotion."
1780	13606	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso mood in the memoir seemed happy and grateful. Narciso's mood sound happy because when he was telling us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining how his house was he was saying how his landlord and daughter nice and how the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he was also saying how his family and friends were very close. In the neighborhood it was despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship, creating a uniquely supportive community. His mother and father made the house cozy and at the end of the memoir the author said ""I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home meaning that he never had a home like the one he lived in now, and he cherished it profoundly. This deep sense of gratitude and belonging completes the portrait of a truly happy upbringing."
1781	13607	5	3	"In this memoir I think the mood is a warm and nice one. One example on how its warm is how he describes the home, focusing on the heart of it. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This is a warm mood because when you think of a kitchen you think of a warm room with sweet aromas of delicious food in the oven, a place of comfort and family gathering. A reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family, creating a supportive environment. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is nice because there was a lot of racism at that time and all the cultures overcame it together, which fostered a genuine sense of community. The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how he appreciates what his parents have done, acknowledging their profound effort. For example it says in paragraph @NUM3, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This is saying that he is grateful that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life, recognizing their immense sacrifice. That is why I think the overall mood of the memoir is warm and nice."
1782	13608	5	3	The mood in this memoir is very relaxed and proud. The author showed that he was so proud of his parents and his culture, reflecting on his heritage with deep respect. He talked with a relaxed feeling and loving everything about his home and culture, describing his surroundings with a sense of comfort and ease. Also the mood is so grateful, permeating his recollections. He is so grateful for his neighbors and how they all came together, forming a close-knit community. Also he was grateful to have his family and friends in his apartment, which provided him with a strong sense of belonging and support. The author was just so proud of his life and parents, and this feeling of pride and thankfulness defines the entire narrative of the memoir.
1783	13609	5	3	"There are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir. First, he had described his house when he had first moved in, setting a foundational scene. He said that it was a simple house, situated in a two-family and it was a blonde-brick building, which establishes a modest and humble beginning. Second, he told us how he should be happy of what he has and to be grateful, emphasizing the value of his experiences. He was saying that the word solidarity was a big word and meant something significant to him and his community. Last, he was describing the hope that he had about his parents and home that he had, expressing a lasting positive sentiment. He was saying that ""which I am eternally grateful"" also, ""which I adore to this day,"" showing his enduring affection and thankfulness. These are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir, weaving together gratitude and fond memory."
1784	13610	5	3	"The mood created by the memoir is gratefulness. I think this because this is one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis, making it a central theme. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful. (paragraph @NUM1),"" highlighting a deep and lasting thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM2 he also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" which directly points to the source of his gratitude. Narciso's memoir states all the things he is grateful for, from his family's efforts to the community they built, and this consistent focus is why I believe gratefulness is the prevailing mood of this passage."
1785	13611	5	3	"The mood that the author in the memoir created was good by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage. To start with, his love is like part of his life. He loves his parents deeply and acknowledges their influence. For example, in the story it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 this means he loves his parents for every little single thing they did for him. Also he learned how to love people from this example, extending that warmth to others. As well as his blood relative, meaning that his heritage and origin @CAPS2 had a significant impact on his identity. He is from Cuba, and came to the United States in 1956, which shaped his experiences. Also born into a simple house, his parents built a traditional home, providing a foundation of culture and stability. This is how the author describes the mood, by his love, his blood relative, and also by the courage his family demonstrated in starting a new life."
1786	13612	5	3	In the memoir many moods were expressed, though I think the mood that was expressed the most was happiness. Narciso described to us that no matter what happened, her family and close friends would always feel a deep sense of belonging with each other. This powerful connection and unwavering support gave everyone mentioned in the story great reason to be happy and feel good about themselves and each other, creating an atmosphere of warmth and contentment. In conclusion, the strongest mood in the story was happiness, which permeated the narrative.
1787	13613	5	3	In the story memoir the author created a couple of different moods to describe the story. The first mood was gratefulness. The author described gratefulness toward the parents when the author was describing the selfless caring of the parents, highlighting their decision to move to @LOCATION1 to give them a better life and future opportunities. The last mood described by the author was happiness. The author described happiness in the story when it was describing the parents making everyone feel at home, fostering a welcoming and joyful environment.

1788	13614	5	3	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, talks about the fashion designer's life and the mood created by the author. After his parents immigrated from Cuba, Narciso was very grateful, a sentiment he carries throughout his life. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (para. six). Narciso believes in his Cuban heritage a lot, and this belief deeply influences his perspective. When coming to @LOCATION1, his neighborhood was full of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, all of whom he considered his extended family. He was grateful for the life, friends, and the strong family support his family has given him. His parents had shown him with their own lives the values of hard work and dedication, and these teachings have been the solid basis of his life. Narciso is grateful for coming to @LOCATION1 and for successfully bringing the essence of his old home in Cuba to his new home in @LOCATION1, creating a beautiful blend of past and present."
1789	13615	5	3	In this memoir the mood created by the author is very positive and uplifting. The author is turning @CAPS1, which was initially not good, into a much better thing through resilience and community. Like when they had a very small house, they turned it into a warm and loving home filled with shared experiences. The people living in this small house generously let others stay with them until they got back on their feet, offering support and kindness. These people made the whole building feel much better and more vibrant by keeping their old culture around, sharing traditions and a sense of shared history that strengthened their bonds.
1790	13616	5	3	"The mood is @CAPS1 in many ways throughout the text. First, the mood in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS1 as if he was happy to immigrate to the @LOCATION1, looking forward to new beginnings. Also, its @CAPS1 as sad, as evidenced by the line, ""... Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" conveying a deep sense of loss. Another mood would be brave, as the act of leaving was an immense act of courage. For me these immigrants are brave because I would never want to leave behind my friends and especially my family, which underscores the difficulty of their decision. Another mood is grateful, which is clear from the statement, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In conclusion, these are the many ways the mood is @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2, reflecting a complex mix of emotions."
1791	13617	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The blueprints of our lives* the mood is heartfilling, and about appreciation. In the memoir, the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" He thanks his parents so much for everything they've done for him, acknowledging their unwavering support. The author also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" He knows it wasn't easy but loves how his parents managed to give him the best life possible through their dedication. Furthermore, the author writes, ""what they did was much more courageous then I could hae ever done."" He knows his parents took chances and did whatever was necessary to keep him happy, which sets this mood to be so warm and heart filling, leaving the reader with a profound sense of familial gratitude."
1792	13618	5	3	"Warmth permeates the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" as the author creates the mood in many ways. One way the author creates the mood is by saying, ""The very heart of which was the kitchen; passionat Cuban music filled the air. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"". This creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly and vibrant place due to the people gathering together, sharing in joy and tradition. Another way the author creates the mood is by stating that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". This expression of mutual support and open-hearted generosity reinforces the feeling of warmth. These are the ways the author of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" effectively created the warm, inviting mood in this story."
1793	13619	5	3	"The author sets a good mood in this memoir about his house. The author states the house is a sign of life and love, a central theme of his recollections. He states, ""always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love."" The author explains the mood by describing a Cuban feast, a sensory experience that embodies this spirit. Also when he learns that in the neighborhood there is love too, it deepens his appreciation. The author states, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The author shows how many cultures and countrys show satisfaction in the whole neiborhood that is filled with mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed. Ultimately, the author shows a good positive, and geneorus mood in the book that has all started in the kitchen with a Cuban feast, symbolizing the beginning of his understanding of community and affection."
1794	13620	5	3	"The mood set in this memoir by the author was greatfullness, and it seemed to be thanking his Family for such a loving childhood. It also seems the author misses it deeply, reflecting on a cherished past. ""I was born into this simple house"" the author says ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" He was very comfortable in his home and loved it, feeling secure and enriched by his upbringing. It seems as thogh the excerpt was made to thank those who he lived with, serving as a tribute to their influence. As it says in the text ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The excerpt explains how caring, and generous his family and neighbors were, stating, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author tells about his neighbor making delicious meals all the time, and their dinner table consisted of many neighbors, and blood relatives, illustrating a community bound by shared food and fellowship. The author had a very close relationship with his neighbors, which fundamentally shaped his grateful perspective on life and family."
1795	13621	5	3	"The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love. The reason why I say love is because to me he cares about his family and he also stayed with his family tradition, showing deep respect for his heritage. He also loved being with his family, cherishing their time together. For example, in the article it says; ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" To me that shows Love, as it highlights the transformative power of care and devotion within the family unit. The author's focus on these heartfelt memories and lessons learned about affection is why I think he created love as his mood in the memoir, leaving a lasting impression of tenderness and familial bond."
1796	13622	5	3	"The mood created by the author is loving and happy for many reasons. It is loving because Narciso really loves his family and is grateful for his parents for giving up their lives to give him a better one, as he states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This profound gratitude underscores the loving atmosphere. It is happy because the overall memoir is about family and friends and how good his childhood was, filled with positive experiences and a strong sense of community. The author reflects that ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" highlighting the joy found in these deep, chosen connections. Those are the biggest moods that this memoir portrays, weaving together a narrative of affection and contentment."
1797	13623	5	3	The mood created by the author in the memoir is one of happiness and gratitude because the author is grateful to his parents for providing fundamental needs and for their courageous character.

This deep-seated appreciation for their efforts and the security they provided is what defines the grateful and happy mood of the author in the memoir, creating a warm and affirming atmosphere throughout the text.
1798	13624	5	3	"The mood created in this memoir was mainly one of family and love. For most of the memoir the author was talking about experiences he had in the house, and the love he had for his family and friends. The first example for the mood is when he says ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows the parents' love for the kids through their selfless actions. A second example for family is when the reading says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family'"" and he is talking about how they are all so close-knit, emphasizing that family is built on bonds stronger than blood. This reading was a good example of a close-knit community and of parental sacrifice for their kids, ultimately portraying a heartwarming and unified spirit."
1799	13625	5	3	"The mood in the author's story is happy and grateful. Happy because even though it was a new country, they came with a purpose and are living it while preserving their culture, which is passed down from family to family. The author notes, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they loved."" Also, he is grateful because he sees what his parents did and continue to do for him so he could be happy, as expressed in the lines, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and ""I was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love!"" This combination of joyful cultural preservation and deep thankfulness defines the overall mood."
1800	13626	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving, caring child in the US, nurtured by a supportive environment. Also, he was proud that even though his family moved to the US from Cuba, he still practices his Cuban culture, maintaining a connection to his heritage. Another reason that he was proud is that he has loving parents that want him to be successful in life and who helped him keep up with his culture by having family come over regularly. As the text describes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary… regularly joined us at our table,"" a quote that shows Narciso Rodriguez's family came to join his parents and him for dinner, reinforcing these cultural and familial ties. Narciso's family gave up everything, including leaving Cuba, so he could have a better life, a life that his family can be proud of, and this legacy of sacrifice is a central source of his pride."
1801	13627	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is nonfiction, established because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his own past and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a vibrant Cuban, Italian, and Spanish neighborhood. The house was lovingly transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with rich Cuban aromas from the kitchen and the lively sounds of Cuban music. The mood became joyful and warm because of the family's deep love of Cuban music and Cuban cooking, which created a truly inviting atmosphere. The mood is also represented through the depiction of his family, a loving and caring unit within a nice apartment building. Ultimately, the mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, which is evident because the ""home"" he describes is so pleasant to be inside, a place of comfort and fond memories."
1802	13628	5	3	The mood was created by the author in the memoir through specific information and descriptive language. The mood is expansive and uplifting, like something vast and beautiful in the sky, which is why the description of the mood evokes such a feeling of openness and wonder. This comparison helps to solidify the overall atmosphere the author intended to convey, finishing the thought on the mood's ethereal quality.
1803	13629	5	3	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative. The feeling of love is what they did most because they basically called everyone their family, creating a wide circle of affection. For example, in one paragraph it says that ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us,"" demonstrating their open-hearted nature. Another mood was caring, because they deeply wanted their children to have a better life than they had. A clear example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give their children a better life, leaving their friends, families, and career in the country they loved,"" which shows the depth of their care and sacrifice. One last mood is appreciative, as seen when the author reflects on his parents' struggles: ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start their life over."" These are the distinct moods that were skillfully created by the author throughout the memoir."
1804	13630	5	3	"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from *Home: The Blueprints of our Lives* is Love and warmth. Love is shown in this excerpt through how grateful he is for his parents and how he feels about them. In one paragraph he says ""I often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" highlighting his deep admiration. Warmth is shown by the way Narciso described the house he grew up in, evoking a sense of comfort. It is stated in another paragraph that ""Here, in innocence of childhood, the congregation of the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The feelings of Love and warmth are expressed all throughout this memoir and these are just a few examples of how the author established this specific, heartfelt mood."
1805	13631	5	3	The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She started off by telling a little history of how she came to be in America but quickly changed the focus to what her home was like. Narciso emphasized the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. She talked about how the Latin music and the big Cuban cooking all combined to create what was her home. She focuses more on the gratitude she feels for her parents even more than on her heritage and family bonds alone. She's focused on how her parents, through their courage and love, made a simple house into a true and lasting home, which is the central theme that defines the memoir's emotional tone.
