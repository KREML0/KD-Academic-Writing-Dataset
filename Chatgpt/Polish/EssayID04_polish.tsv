The inclusion of ""When the snow melts"" is deliberate, as winter signifies a period of dormancy and death. As the snows melt away, so too will Saeng's fears dissipate, allowing her to embrace the opportunities that lie ahead in her journey of renewal."
316	9179	4	1	In the spring, as the snows melt away, the once pristine landscape transforms into a muddy terrain, unsightly and uninviting. The pigs revel in the mire, finding solace in the wet earth.

321	9184	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides her solace; she articulates, ìwhen they resurface in the spring, as the snows dissolve and the geese reappear, and this hibiscus starts to bloom, at that moment I will undertake that examination once more.î Given the author's initial failure in the examination as detailed in the story, she anticipates finding reassurance in retaking the test when the hibiscus blooms once more after the winter season.

491	9354	4	1	"Saeng failed her driving examination in the initial stages of the narrative. Encountering a hibiscus plant, she purchases it due to its evocation of her life in Vietnam. Inhaling its familiar fragrance, Saeng is transported to memories of her grandmother, envisioning the wispy strands of her long grey hair. The flower serves as a poignant reminder of her beloved grandmother. Saeng's mother remarks, ""I have observed this type of flower blooming near the lake; its blossoms may not be as visually striking, yet it possesses the resilience to endure the harsh winter months."" Her intent is to console her daughter in this moment of disappointment.

492	9355	4	1	The author concludes her narrative with the realization that what had previously seemed peculiar were simply manifestations of the changing seasons and plant life. Therefore, she strategically placed this paragraph at the conclusion to signify her return to academia in spring to reattempt the examination.

Additionally, it is likely that she chose to end the story this way because, much like the blooming of the plant, she is embarking on a new beginning as she prepares to undertake the test.

494	9357	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with that paragraph to illustrate how the serenity bestowed by the flower will bolster her resolve, preventing her from giving up.

In doing so, she sought to demonstrate her point and rectify the imperfect circumstances that had transpired.
496	9359	4	1	The author would opt to retake the test in the spring rather than the winter season. This decision is based on the belief that during the spring, she would be able to maintain a higher level of concentration solely on the test, without being distracted by thoughts of planting.

508	9371	4	1	Saeng endeavored to demonstrate her resilience and perseverance, striving to optimize her current circumstances. The significant relocation to a foreign land had dampened her spirits, particularly during the winter season when homesickness weighed heavily on her. In an attempt to find solace and connection to her roots, she acquired a hibiscus flower, symbolizing a piece of her homeland. As she awaits the arrival of spring, she anticipates blossoming alongside the flower and preparing once more for the examination she seeks to conquer. Embracing her new environment, she embraces the hibiscus as a beacon of hope in a season unsuitable for its bloom.
509	9372	4	1	Saeng felt compelled to seek assistance from Phil, despite the possibility of feeling a sense of loss regarding her origins. Her mother expressed displeasure at the expense incurred, prompting Saeng to quietly pledge to herself in the spring that she would reattempt the examination.

511	9374	4	1	The author concludes the narrative at this juncture to sustain a sense of intrigue regarding the forthcoming events. The elucidation provided thus far encapsulates the crux of the tale.

The author has adeptly expounded on the significance of the protagonist and her mother, rendering further exposition superfluous. The denouement, shrouded in ambiguity, elicits curiosity and contemplation, fostering a nuanced engagement with the storyline.
512	9375	4	1	Saeng feels displaced in her new residence and adopted country. She silently pledges that within a year, she will undertake the test once more.

Despite their sudden disappearance, she resolves to pick herself up and declare that she is ready to try again. In making this decision, she commits herself to exploring new strategies to adjust to unforeseen circumstances.
514	9377	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to convey her intention of taking the examination during a more favorable time frame, specifically when the weather is milder. By opting for a warmer period, she anticipates that the test conditions will be less harsh and challenging, thereby increasing her chances of success.
515	9378	4	1	The narrative concludes with this passage for several reasons. Firstly, the spring season brings warmth and sunshine, allowing for a cheerful ending to the tale.

516	9379	4	1	In the vernal season, as the snows gradually dissolve and the migratory geese make their return, while the hibiscus plant outside begins its budding process, I shall undertake the examination once more. This decision epitomizes the resilience and adaptability demonstrated by nature itself. Just as the geese acclimate to new surroundings each year, so too can I navigate unfamiliar territories and circumstances. The upcoming test symbolizes an opportunity for growth and transformation, mirroring the cyclical patterns of the natural world. Thus, if these beings can endure and evolve, then I, too, possess the capacity to acclimatize and flourish in uncharted environments.
517	9380	4	1	Authors often conclude their stories with paragraphs that leave readers pondering what might happen next. In Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author employs such a technique in the final paragraph. This deliberate choice signifies a forward-looking perspective, as the protagonist expresses her intention to take the test once the snow thaws, the geese return, and the hibiscus blooms. These natural phenomena symbolize new beginnings and renewal, instilling hope in the protagonist that she will succeed in her endeavors. The mention of the blooming hibiscus also suggests a semblance of the protagonist's former home, hinting at a possibility of a brighter future. Through this enigmatic ending, the author prompts readers to contemplate the protagonist's journey and the potential outcomes that lie ahead.
518	9381	4	1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because they wanted the readers to comprehend the underlying message of the narrative. For instance, when Saeng made a silent vow to herself that she would retake the test in spring, after the snow had melted, the geese had returned, and the hibiscus was budding, it was a subtle indication of the character's determination and resilience. This final paragraph serves as a reflection of the characters' thoughts and emotions, allowing readers to delve deeper into the story's themes and gain a better understanding of the overall message being conveyed.
519	9382	4	1	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng. They remind her of her homeland. When the familiar things return, she will have the strength to face the test again and hopefully do better. The narrator says, ""Overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and familiar to Saeng now."" This demonstrates how the geese symbolize the familiar aspects from her homeland that help Saeng feel more comfortable in her new home."
520	9383	4	1	The author included that passage to convey her longing for her homeland, which is evident in her reminiscence of the hibiscus plant. The hibiscus plant serves as a reminder of her roots and the memories associated with her upbringing. Through the mention of the hibiscus, the author subtly expresses her yearning for the familiarity and comfort of her native land. The plant symbolizes her connection to her past and provides her with a sense of solace amidst her current circumstances. It is a poignant reflection of her deep-seated nostalgia for the place she once called home.
521	9384	4	1	The author concludes the story with a reflection on Saeng, hinting at the personal significance she holds. It appears that Saeng's past or origins are of great importance to her, as she expresses a desire to return in the spring and retake a school test or perhaps plant something anew. This suggests that her roots are deeply meaningful to her, and she longs to reconnect with her past. The mention of snow and the cold weather preventing planting also highlights the contrast between her current surroundings and where she originally came from. Saeng's determination to go back to her roots indicates a strong emotional attachment to her origins, emphasizing their significance in shaping her identity and aspirations.
522	9385	4	1	When they return, Saeng pledged silently to herself, in the spring, as the snow melts and the geese make their way back, and the hibiscus blooms again, then I will undertake the test once more. The hibiscus plant has instilled in her a newfound sense of confidence to strive for improvement in the times ahead.
523	9386	4	1	The author concludes the narrative in this manner for several reasons. Firstly, she anticipates gaining more familiarity with her adopted country as time progresses. Having departed her native land only a few months earlier, she believes that an additional six months will afford her a deeper understanding of the customs and practices of her new home. This increased knowledge will enhance her chances of successfully passing the @CAPS1 Ed examination. Moreover, the author looks forward to the arrival of spring when the flowers will bloom once more, symbolizing a renewal of strength and determination that will propel her towards success. The intervening months will provide her with ample time to prepare both mentally and physically for the impending test. Mentally, she intends to dedicate herself to diligent study and mastery of the required material. Physically, the passage of time will bring about further growth and maturity, equipping her with new insights and perspectives that will aid her in achieving her goal.
524	9387	4	1	"In order to overcome her recent setback, Saeng purchased a flower that evoked memories of her homeland. Tears welled up in her eyes as she made the purchase, longing for the familiarity of her home. Determined to regain her confidence, she whispered to herself, ""When the snows thaw, the geese return, and this hibiscus blooms, then I shall attempt the test once more."" These familiar sights and scents were her solace, providing a sense of comfort that would surely aid her in facing the challenges ahead. The concluding paragraph encapsulates the essence of what home means to Saeng, illustrating how these memories will serve as her guiding light in the journey ahead."
525	9388	4	1	The author chose to conclude the story in this manner to emphasize the importance of second chances and fresh starts in life. The underlying message conveyed is that failure should not deter one from trying again. When Saeng did not pass the test, her confidence took a hit. However, her mother's encouragement helped her realize the value of perseverance and starting anew. Giving up would have been a disservice to herself, but with a fresh start, she could pursue success once more. In essence, the author's conclusion underscores the significance of resilience and determination in overcoming setbacks and achieving one's goals.
526	9389	4	1	"Minfong Ho included the final paragraph in the narrative to subtly suggest that saeng found solace and confidence in thoughts of her homeland. Upon seeing the hibiscus, she experienced a profound, almost visceral, sensation. The author creatively utilized the winter hibiscus as a symbol of resilience, surviving the harsh winter months. This led the reader to infer that the flower provided saeng with hope and strength. The mention of the geese flying in a V formation, reminiscent of Vietnam, further reinforces this idea. By concluding with ""and the geese return,"" Ho prompts readers to recognize the significance of finding comfort in familiar objects, which ultimately empowers individuals. The strategic placement of this concluding thought effectively encapsulates the story's underlying message: drawing confidence from one's roots and embracing what feels like home can nurture strength and resilience. Though one may initially seem fragile, with steadfast determination, they can flourish with unwavering self-assurance."
527	9390	4	1	The concluding paragraph of the narrative subtly reveals Saeng's eager anticipation for an early arrival of spring, as she yearns to behold her cherished hibiscus. Should spring delay its onset, the hibiscus might remain concealed beneath the snow, denying Saeng the opportunity to witness its beauty. As Saeng ascends, her aspirations include the successful completion of the impending test, which holds significance in her academic journey.
528	9391	4	1	"The author concludes the narrative with the statement, ""When they return, Saeng silently vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus begins to bloom, then I will retake that examination."" The winter hibiscus symbolizes a fresh start for her. In her hometown, she had hibiscus plants, signifying a period of normalcy and contentment. However, upon relocating to the United States, the absence of hibiscus and her failure in the driving test left her feeling displaced and out of sync. The sight of the winter hibiscus brought her a sense of familiarity and comfort. It represented a new beginning for her, a chance to start anew and find her place once more. Thus, the author chose to end with that sentence, as the hibiscus marked the beginning of a new chapter in Saeng's life."
529	9392	4	1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to draw a parallel between her own life and the cyclical nature of the geese's return. Just as the geese come back each year, she believes she will have another opportunity to succeed. The upcoming spring symbolizes renewal and hope, as the hibiscus plant will bloom again, reminding her of her old home and the chance to retake her failed driving test. This final part beautifully ties together the themes of renewal and second chances in the story.
530	9393	4	1	The author concludes the story with a brief paragraph because sometimes, it is the little details that hold the most significance. In just two sentences, the author effectively summarizes the key elements of the narrative. This concise approach highlights the importance of attention to detail and the power of brevity in storytelling. Overall, the author's choice to end with a succinct paragraph enhances the impact of the story and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
531	9394	4	1	The author concludes that Saeng will have to retake the test from the beginning. She believes there may be a higher probability of success when the hibiscus blossoms and the snow thaws. Consequently, Saeng plans to attempt the test again after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms.
532	9395	4	1	The author concludes with this statement for a couple of reasons. Saeng believes she cannot undertake the task until the arrival of spring, as that is when the geese return and the hibiscus buds. She envisions herself flourishing in the springtime, ready to face and overcome the challenge ahead.
533	9396	4	1	I believe the author includes this paragraph in the story because the grandmother may perceive it as a challenge to assess her efficiency. The grandmother might surpass expectations in completing tasks within a limited time frame.
534	9397	4	1	I believe the author concludes the narrative in such a manner because by the time spring arrives, she anticipates being prepared to retake the test. Alternatively, it could be interpreted that by the onset of spring, she will have gained confidence and readiness to face the challenge anew. The author may have intended to convey that just as spring heralds new beginnings, it signifies a fresh start for her as well.
535	9398	4	1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng expresses her determination to try again. Despite failing her driving test, she decides to retake it after gaining confidence from planting with her mother. Planting the hibiscus seems to have boosted her self-assurance in pursuing success once more. It appears that she has grown accustomed to the process of planting. Having achieved something, she now believes she can retake the test and succeed. In essence, this is why the author chose to end the story with that paragraph.
536	9399	4	1	The author concludes the narrative with a thought-provoking statement to underscore the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Much like Saeng, the hibiscus finds itself in a new environment, necessitating adaptation to its surroundings. Disheartened by her recent failure in the driving test, Saeng is reminded that overcoming challenges is possible, as evidenced by the hibiscus thriving amidst adversity. This realization offers hope that Saeng can conquer her driving obstacles with resilience and determination.
537	9400	4	1	The author concludes with this final paragraph as it may offer a glimmer of hope to Saeng's mother. The potential for Saeng to succeed in the test could serve as a source of encouragement for his family, particularly if passing the test holds significant importance for them.
538	9401	4	1	"The author's conclusion of the story with the final paragraph was crucial in reaffirming the significance of the hibiscus and its importance to Saeng. It underscored her resilience in adapting to a new environment and overcoming obstacles. Without this concluding paragraph, readers would have been left to speculate on Saeng's future. The initial emotional breakdown she experienced upon seeing the hibiscus highlighted its symbolic meaning as a connection to her homeland. By reiterating its importance at the end, the author provided closure and direction for Saeng's journey. The statement, ""This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifies a fresh start for Saeng and a renewed opportunity to confront her challenges. The last paragraph was indispensable in tying up loose ends and offering readers a deeper understanding of the story's message."
539	9402	4	1	Including the notion of retaking the examination when the hibiscus is in bud imparts a sense of closure and a moral lesson to an otherwise inconclusive finale. Saeng faces failure in her driving test early on in the narrative, yet the significance of her purchase of a hibiscus on her way back home only becomes apparent in the closing paragraph. The hibiscus symbolizes resilience and fortitude. Despite enduring a harsh winter, this flower can bloom anew and persist. Likewise, despite the challenges of relocating from Vietnam and grappling with adaptation, Saeng must recuperate and persevere. Just as the hibiscus blossoms once more, so will Saeng. She will undertake the test a second time and succeed. She will acclimate to her surroundings and press forward, akin to the hibiscus.
540	9403	4	1	When Saeng returns, she silently vows to herself that in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. The author began the story with Saeng failing her driving test. The hibiscus in the garden reminds Saeng of her homeland. After she longed for the hibiscus, a flock of Canada geese flew by. As they passed, Saeng felt a sense of comfort and made a promise to herself to revisit the beginning. Passing the driving test would have prevented her from discovering the hibiscus.
541	9404	4	1	The author mentions this because her mother successfully completed the assessment, inspiring the daughter to follow suit. The daughter aspires to emulate her mother's achievement and can only undertake the test during the spring season, as winter lacks the necessary blossoms for the evaluation.
542	9405	4	1	"The author seems to suggest that Saeng is beginning to come to terms with and move past the challenges in her life. She appears to have acclimated to @LOCATION1 and its customs, while still holding onto her cultural heritage. ""However, she had herself much preferred it to a Big Mac."" This indicates her willingness to embrace new experiences and not let setbacks define her. Rather than dwell on the difficulties she faces, Saeng is choosing to adopt a more positive and proactive attitude. After visiting the flower shop, she gains a newfound sense of optimism and decides to take action to improve her circumstances. This shift in perspective signals a turning point for Saeng as she looks towards a brighter future, determined to overcome obstacles and pursue new opportunities."
543	9406	4	1	The author's conclusion of the story is multifaceted. One possible reason is the indication that winter has arrived, symbolizing a period of dormancy and waiting. As mentioned in the narrative, the winter hibiscus has been planted, signifying the need to endure the cold season before new growth can begin. By ending with this imagery, the author suggests a hopeful anticipation of blooming and renewal once spring arrives.
544	9407	4	1	The author concludes the narrative by emphasizing the significance of the plant to the protagonist, symbolizing familiarity and comfort in a time of uncertainty and loss. The protagonist's deep emotional response to the plant reflects a sense of connection and stability amidst upheaval. Through this conclusion, it is implied that the protagonist will find solace and grounding in both old and new elements of her life, such as the plant and the geese, as she navigates the challenges ahead.
545	9408	4	1	"In the narrative ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with the notion that she will be better equipped and more knowledgeable for future encounters with the garden and its accompanying challenges. In her initial attempt, she was ill-prepared and lacked awareness of the winter hibiscus due to her lack of experience in such matters. Now, she looks forward to the next opportunity, armed with newfound insights and readiness."
546	9409	4	1	"In the tale ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative concludes with the notion that ""in the spring, as the snows thaw and the geese make their return, and as this hibiscus begins to bloom, I shall undertake that examination once more."" The author opts for this ending to signify the resilience and determination of the protagonist. While initially stumbling in her test, she refuses to be disheartened by this setback, much like how the hibiscus thrives in the face of changing seasons. The parallel drawn between the adaptability of the hibiscus and the protagonist's resolve serves as a poignant reminder that just as the plant adjusts to its surroundings, so too can she persist in her efforts to succeed."
547	9410	4	1	The reason she concluded the narrative in such a manner is due to the symbolic significance of blooming flowers, signifying a sense of belonging and well-being. The protagonist, who used to assist her grandmother with her hair before her relocation, would find solace in the blossoming flowers, reminiscent of her grandmother. This connection would serve as motivation for her to excel in her upcoming test, as the flourishing flora would evoke memories of her grandmother's nurturing presence and inspire her to perform at her best.
548	9411	4	1	The author concludes the narrative as the snow begins to melt, signifying the transition from winter to spring. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding are depicted as moments in time, highlighting the cyclical nature of the seasons. The isolated hibiscus serves as a symbol of resilience in the face of changing weather patterns, standing alone yet vibrant amidst the thawing landscape. This vivid imagery captures the beauty and fragility of nature, reminding us of the constant cycle of life and renewal.
549	9412	4	1	The author concluded the narrative with that paragraph to convey Saeng's contemplation on the impending arrival of winter and the necessity to endure until the return of spring for her tasks to resume.
550	9413	4	1	Saeng shows a genuine concern for the flora. She is particularly invested in the well-being of a singular flower, appreciating the individualistic growth patterns that each one exhibits.
551	9414	4	1	In the narrative, the author contemplates the significance of her decision to refrain from retaking a test she had already completed. Perhaps she was reflecting on the diligence she displayed in completing all assessments, resolving not to revisit them in the future. The moment arrived when she found herself immersed in the academic environment, facing the challenge of taking a test that once held such value, now relegated to a mere memory of a bygone era. With the conclusion of her schooling, the chapter on assessments was closed, marking the end of an era.
552	9415	4	1	The author concludes this paragraph within the story to provide a fitting ending. The selected conclusion aligns best with the overall narrative, wrapping up the plot effectively and satisfyingly.
553	9416	4	1	I believe the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because it revolved around the theme of perseverance.

Upon entering the store, Saeng is struck by the flood of memories she had forgotten from her life in Vietnam. ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world."" This is when Saeng begins to associate herself and her childhood with these plants. Upon seeing another familiar plant in a pot, she reflects, ""How strange to see it in a pot; back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs."" This symbolizes her feeling of being out of place and confined, compared to the freedom she experienced in her home country. When her mother describes the hibiscus plant as ""strong enough to make it through the cold months,"" Saeng sees herself in this description.
