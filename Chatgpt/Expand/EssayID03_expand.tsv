The relentless hills seemed never-ending, and dehydration began to set in due to the lack of adequate water and supplies. The scorching sun beat down on him mercilessly, exacerbating his already difficult situation. This is how the change in setting greatly impacted the cyclist, pushing him to his limits.
68	6046	3	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case, it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty hot outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must-have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn't much easier. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought to be a diamondback. The rough terrain and the potential danger of encountering a snake made his journey even more challenging. Despite these obstacles, the cyclist persevered and continued on his path, navigating through the tough conditions of the setting. It goes to show that the environment can play a significant role in influencing our experiences and decisions, even when we least expect it.
69	6047	3	3	The features of setting have a significant impact on cyclists as they navigate their routes.

Despite some cool pines around, they offer little relief. Moreover, there is no access to water for a long time, leading to dehydration. The narration mentions, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie). Dehydration impairs the cyclist's biking skills, such as balance and strength. Furthermore, the absence of any individuals around poses a risk in case of a heat stroke, as there is no one to offer help. The uncertainty of the distance to the destination or the next water source adds to the challenges faced by the cyclist in this isolated and unforgiving desert setting."

72	6050	3	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclistís attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyî If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, ì I was doing a water-depleting 12 mphî This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.
73	6051	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty. I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be very hot. Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding. The challenging terrain and limited resources made the journey even more arduous for the cyclist, testing their endurance and determination. Despite the obstacles, the cyclist persevered, pushing through the difficult conditions and continuing on their path.
74	6052	3	3	How the setting of the place affects the cyclist is significant. Firstly, if the location is too dry, the cyclist may face dehydration and exhaustion, as mentioned in the text when the protagonist was travelling through the high parts of California in June, indicating extreme heat and dryness.

The cyclist soon found himself battling dehydration as the sun blazed overhead. ""The sun was beginning to beat down,"" he thought, realizing the challenge he faced in staying hydrated in such unforgiving conditions. The importance of water became increasingly apparent as the day wore on, highlighting the harsh reality of traversing a desert landscape on two wheels."
78	6056	3	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic effect on the author. The effect was bad rather than good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had a limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the scorching temperatures. Another feature that had a great impediment on the author's well-being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbled across at the snack.

I felt like I was not going to make it through the desert to Yosemite National Park. ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,"" I thought to myself. The harsh setting of the cyclist's journey greatly impacted his perception of the challenges he faced."
80	6058	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist as he navigates through a deserted campground in California. The dusty surroundings indicate a lack of maintenance and human presence. The abandoned town further emphasizes the isolated and uninhabited nature of the area. The presence of a snake on the road suggests that wildlife has taken over the deserted town. The cyclist must be cautious and alert as he continues his journey through this desolate landscape.
81	6059	3	3	"The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, ""short rolling hills,"" and around a, ""ridiculously large snake,"" and because it's hot, he could suffer from heatstroke at any minute. The scorching sun beats down on him, intensifying the heat of the day and making the journey even more challenging. The sight of the massive snake adds an element of danger and uncertainty to his ride, forcing him to stay alert and navigate carefully. The combination of physical exertion, extreme temperatures, and unexpected obstacles creates a tense and demanding environment for the cyclist.

83	6061	3	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something to look forward to, but the rough terrain he has to endure to get there causes him despair. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and feels the scorching heat of the sun during the early stages of the trip, he brushes it off, saying, ""I barely noticed it, the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" Despite starting to feel the toll that the trip and the sun were taking on him, he pushed on with the hope and anticipation of reaching Yosemite. However, the more the cyclist noticed the relentless sun, the more he drank from his water supply, until it seemed to be running low. Hoping to refill his water, he came across an old rusty water pump, only to be disappointed by the taste of bitter battery acid. The rolling hills, sun, and tumbleweeds did nothing to quench the cyclist's thirst or alleviate his frustration. If he had seen a sign that said Yosemite was a certain number of miles away, his spirits would have been lifted, but instead, he encountered a sign that warned of a rough road ahead, further dampening his mood. If the terrain had been smoother, easier to traverse, and with ample water supply, the cyclist's journey would have been more hopeful, but in his current state of despair, the setting only added to his grief."
84	6062	3	3	"The bike rider in the short story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by @PERSON1 is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running low on water. However, since it is such a dry place, he can't find any. Also, since it is out in the middle of nowhere, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else, he wouldn't have had either problems. However, if the story was set in a more urban or populated area, the bike rider could have easily found a store or gas station to purchase water. Additionally, in a more fertile environment, there would have been sources of water such as rivers or lakes where the rider could have refilled his supply. The harsh conditions of the desert make it difficult for the bike rider to find the resources he needs to survive, highlighting the importance of being prepared and mindful of one's surroundings."
85	6063	3	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area that's hot in your head.

100	6078	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map. As he pedaled through the scorching heat of the desert, the sun beating down on him relentlessly, he felt the dryness in his throat intensify. The landscape around him seemed never-ending, with no signs of life or civilization in sight. Despite the challenges he faced, the cyclist pushed on, determined to reach his destination. The harsh desert setting tested his resilience and resourcefulness, but he remained steadfast in his journey, fueled by the hope of finding his way to town.

Lastly, the text states, ìGRAPE AND @CAPS1íS FISH CAMPî The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The settingís features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."
102	6080	3	3	The features of the setting made the cyclistís ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it ìOver on long, crippling hillî. The word ìcripplingì is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclistís ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding. The cyclist faced an unexpected challenge as the smooth road turned into rolling hills, and eventually a long, steep hill that tested his physical limits. The changing terrain made his journey more arduous and demanding, requiring him to push himself harder to reach his destination.
103	6081	3	3	There are numerous features in the setting that affect the cyclist. For example, the rough road can make cycling more challenging and potentially lead to accidents or injuries. Additionally, the presence of tumbleweeds can obstruct the cyclist's path, causing them to swerve or come to a sudden stop. Furthermore, encountering a snake on the road can startle the cyclist and pose a potential threat if they are bitten. In conclusion, these various elements of the setting can significantly impact the cyclist's journey and overall experience.
104	6082	3	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didnít seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept passing by him, making him feel like he was not going fast enough. Additionally, the presence of other people on the road also influenced the cyclist as he had to constantly be aware of his surroundings and adjust his speed and direction accordingly. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, affecting both his physical and mental state throughout the journey.
105	6083	3	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, casting harsh shadows across the barren landscape. The dry, cracked earth stretches out endlessly in all directions, devoid of any signs of life. With no water in sight, the oppressive heat threatens to overwhelm him as he struggles to find any semblance of shelter from the relentless sun. The vast emptiness of the desert only serves to amplify his sense of isolation and vulnerability. If something were to happen to him out here, it could be days or even weeks before anyone stumbled upon his lifeless body. The realization sends a shiver down his spine, as he knows that his survival in this unforgiving environment is truly a battle against the elements.
106	6084	3	3	The cyclist encountered several challenges during his ride. Riding on rough, rusty bumps made the journey uncomfortable and tiring. Additionally, the lack of water led to dehydration, causing the cyclist to struggle to maintain a decent speed. The warning of rough roads ahead highlighted the dangers he faced, urging him to stay within the speed limit. These obstacles combined to create a difficult and demanding ride for the cyclist.
107	6085	3	3	"The setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" played a significant role in the protagonist's challenges. The large hills he had to navigate made him exert more effort and tire quickly. The intense heat of June posed a serious risk of heatstroke, especially as his water supply dwindled. The abandoned Juice Factory, with its ironic imagery of a boy enjoying a refreshing drink, served as a stark reminder of the protagonist's desperate situation. Overall, the setting seemed designed to not only subject the protagonist to harsh natural conditions but also to mock him in his suffering."
108	6086	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are riding is dry, abandoned, quiet, hot, cold, and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when it says ""there was none in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This would make it hard for a cyclist because you need a good water supply, and that's hard to keep when there is nothing around. Additionally, the lack of shelter or shade in the deserted setting can make it challenging for the cyclist to find relief from the scorching sun or harsh weather conditions. The absence of any visible signs of life or civilization can also create a sense of isolation and unease, further impacting the cyclist's experience. Overall, the desolate and barren setting presents numerous obstacles and challenges for the cyclist, making their journey difficult and potentially dangerous."

110	6088	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist significantly. The hot sun was causing him to sweat and become dehydrated quickly. The rolling hills were draining his energy, making him tired. Luckily, he stumbled upon a modern bathroom with cold, refreshing water that allowed him to rehydrate and regain some strength. This replenishment enabled the cyclist to continue on his journey.
111	6089	3	3	"In the essay ""DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,"" the author conveys a sense of urgency and desperation as he describes the dangers of pushing himself beyond his limits while cycling. The imagery of extreme heat and physical exhaustion paints a vivid picture of his struggle for survival. As someone who has experienced chronic dehydration, I can empathize with the author's ordeal of battling the elements and facing the threat of heatstroke.  If the author were cycling in a more picturesque and temperate environment, such as lush greenery and refreshing mountains, his journey would likely have been much more pleasant and less perilous. The harsh desert landscape he describes adds to the sense of isolation and danger he is confronted with. Despite the challenges he faces, the author's determination to endure and reach his destination is evident throughout the essay.  Overall, the essay serves as a stark reminder of the importance of respecting one's physical limits and being mindful of the risks involved in pushing oneself too far. By heeding the advice to not exceed the posted speed limit, the author ultimately emphasizes the value of prioritizing safety and well-being in any endeavor."
112	6090	3	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist.

Overall, the harsh and unforgiving setting significantly impacts the cyclist's experience and adds to the tension and suspense of the story.
113	6091	3	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a California desert in June the temperature had to be in the 90s. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly."" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water. Also, the objects the cyclist comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. The cyclist is greatly affected by the features in the story setting. Additionally, the rough terrain and uneven road surfaces make it challenging for the cyclist to maintain balance and control, leading to potential accidents and injuries.

114	6092	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June, he's in the desert, and low on water were what almost led to his own downfall.

As he pedaled through the scorching desert, the sun beat down relentlessly, causing beads of sweat to form on his brow. With each passing minute, his water supply dwindled, leaving him parched and desperate. Despite the overwhelming odds stacked against him, he somehow managed to push through, his determination shining brighter than the blazing sun. In the end, he emerged victorious, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.
115	6093	3	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men advised him, the cyclist had high hopes as he looked at the scenery and enjoyed seeing the beauty of nature. However, as he continued on his journey, he realized that the terrain was much more challenging than he had anticipated. The rolling hills turned into steep mountains, and the smooth roads became rough and rugged. The idyllic surroundings that had initially inspired him now seemed to mock his efforts. Despite the struggle, the cyclist persevered, determined to overcome the obstacles and reach his destination. In the end, he learned that appearances can be deceiving, and true success often requires facing difficulties head-on.
116	6094	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him. The harsh environment and lack of resources made the cyclist's journey incredibly difficult and dangerous, highlighting the impact of setting on his experience.
117	6095	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man's journey he was confident in his abilities. ""I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face."" The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" However, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was ""traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremely hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey."
118	6096	3	3	"The features of the setting in ìRough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, ìaffect the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, ìÖA young pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head ì (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This tells that the cyclist feels depressed and is majorly affected by these sights. This could and would later ruin his self-esteem and think about dying. The desolate and barren landscape only adds to his sense of hopelessness, making him feel even more isolated and lost on his journey. The harsh conditions of the setting serve as a stark reminder of the challenges he faces, both physically and emotionally, as he continues on his rough road ahead."

120	6098	3	3	"The setting of the essay didn't really help the author on his journey. There were not many structures on the way, with the towns being described as ""ghost towns."" This lack of civilization couldn't have reassured the author that things were going his way. Additionally, the scorching heat during his journey through the deserts of California in June must have been draining. Deserts are known for their extreme heat, and June is the peak of summer, making the conditions even more unbearable. All of these factors likely took a toll on the author's confidence and energy levels until he finally reached the last town with the bait store. It's clear that the setting had a significant impact on his journey, making it a challenging and potentially discouraging experience."
121	6099	3	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist is very clear in case of this essay which resene when it @CAPS1 the signs that said ìRough @CAPS2 ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit.î That had to slow down his bike. ìThen he said that their were no building or cars nowhere.

The cyclist's experience highlights the importance of being mindful of warning signs and adapting one's speed to ensure safety in unfamiliar or hazardous environments. It serves as a reminder for all cyclists to be vigilant and cautious while exploring new paths and terrains.
122	6100	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, ìThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.î This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, ìOne ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldnít had in the larger mule greeted me.î This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome,if they over fear the journey and turned ìold timersî who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.
123	6101	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I arrived at the first ""town."" The setting of the desert affected the cyclist because the cyclist was riding down the road when the men with the setting came and affected the cyclist. The man was very crazy. Her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and he that should drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who were it been off their to tough.

In the end, the setting proved to be a formidable opponent, but the cyclist's determination and perseverance ultimately led them to success."
124	6102	3	3	"The cyclist trusted a man that didn't know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he started to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasn't anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry, he was now crossing the desert which was making him tired and dehydrated. He passed a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes, continuing until he saw the ""Juice"" company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom, and drank some water. When he got out, an old man asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no.

134	6112	3	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even the need for water. In paragraph 1, the writer says one of the hills was long and arduous. The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the temperature was hot and draining.
135	6113	3	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in seemed to be abandoned which doesnít give a well thinking to this person. If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then wonít be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly in front of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature.

The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, 'I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.' When you're pedaling through the desert on a hot day, it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting, this feeling of despair would not be in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.

An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Tiís better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing whatís going to happen next. Knowing the weather and animals in the area can greatly impact the safety and overall experience of a cyclist on a trip. Being prepared and aware of these features can make a significant difference in ensuring a smooth and enjoyable journey.
140	6118	3	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist. At first, the cyclist started off pretty easy. He had flat, smooth roads to go through. He set out before the sun could hit him, with the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite calling his name. He kept his mind off the sun, which helped him push through. But then, he reached a highway that made it kind of harder. The terrain started changing, flat roads replaced by short, rolling hills. He had to pedal harder, tiring himself faster. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed his path, and trying to keep his balance in a dehydrated state became a challenge. The desert heat was taking its toll, with little water left. The changing terrain made the journey even more difficult for him.
141	6119	3	3	The sun was beginning to beat down as I arrived at the first town, fitting the definition of a ghost town perfectly. The abandoned buildings loomed over me, casting long shadows in the scorching desert heat. I pedaled on, feeling the exhaustion setting in as my water supply dwindled. The deserted streets echoed with the sound of my tires on the rough pavement, a stark contrast to the bustling life that must have once filled this place. As I continued on my journey, the unforgiving landscape seemed to mirror my own fatigue and growing sense of unease. The relentless sun beat down on me, mirroring the harsh reality of my situation - a rough road ahead with no end in sight.
142	6120	3	3	In the story, the cyclist faces numerous challenges during the race. He encounters a rough road that he must navigate carefully to avoid any accidents. Additionally, he has to be on the lookout for diamondback snakes along the way, adding to the danger and tension of the race. However, the most pressing issue for the cyclist throughout the race is the scarcity of water. He quickly runs out of water, making it a struggle to stay hydrated and focused. When he finally reaches a factory and stops, he resorts to putting rocks in his mouth to distract himself from the intense thirst, allowing his saliva to circulate and provide some relief. Despite all these obstacles, the cyclist demonstrates remarkable determination and perseverance in his quest to finish the race.
143	6121	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist as he rode along a route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. Being on the road for the first time with only outdated knowledge made the cyclist uneasy. The scorching hot temperature with little shade and the relentless sun beating down on him added to his discomfort. The route offered little relief, teasing him with false hopes of finding water. At the first town, a water pump provided only sludge and water that tasted like battery acid, leaving him even more thirsty. Approaching a deserted old building that turned out to be an old bottling factory for Welch's grape juice, the cyclist thought he was finally closing in on something to drink, only to be left disappointed once again. The harsh conditions and lack of resources made the journey even more challenging for the cyclist, testing his endurance and determination.
144	6122	3	3	"During the cyclist's bike ride, the unbearable conditions changed his attitude. At first, he was frustrated with the old timers and their directions. However, as he realized he might have enough water, his attitude shifted. He began to appreciate the beauty around him, saying, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" But then, the heat became even more unbearable, leading him to consider giving up. Despite losing hope as he slowly gained elevation, he stumbled upon Gary and Wilber's fish camp, where he found safety and relief."
145	6123	3	3	"The bicyclist from ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit"" was affected in many ways by the environment. The lack of water posed a serious threat to his survival, as he was becoming increasingly dehydrated. Additionally, the scorching heat made the journey even more challenging, as the high temperatures exacerbated his dehydration. The absence of people in the towns he passed through added to the eerie atmosphere, heightening his sense of isolation and frustration. The terrain also presented difficulties, transitioning from a smooth, flat road to rolling hills that required more effort to traverse. Furthermore, encountering a snake on the road forced him to navigate around it, adding to the obstacles he faced. Overall, the harsh environmental conditions and various challenges along the way significantly impacted the bicyclist's journey."
146	6124	3	3	"""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the barren landscape, and relentless sun. First, he notices the sun overhead him, expected for California in June, but nevertheless intense. Then, next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation. Going uphill means his body working harder, burning calories, and depleting his much-needed water supply. The challenge becomes even greater as he encounters a speed limit of 12, making progress difficult. Adding to his torment, a billboard shows a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth, a cruel reminder of what he lacks. In this story, every element of his surroundings contributes to his hopelessness, amplifying his struggle against the harsh conditions of his journey."
147	6125	3	3	The feature of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. The road conditions were described as awful, making it challenging for the cyclist to navigate. Additionally, the presence of a large snake blocking the path and occasional tumbleweeds added to the obstacles faced by the cyclist. However, the most pressing issue was the lack of water in the scorching heat, leading to fatigue and exhaustion. The harsh setting made the journey incredibly difficult for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of being prepared for such challenging environments.
148	6126	3	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or Vermont, it would be a no-brainer to bike in Vermont. The temperature in Vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story, the cyclist complains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride. Additionally, biking in a cooler climate like Vermont would not only prevent dehydration but also provide a more comfortable and enjoyable biking experience. The fresh air, lush green landscapes, and moderate temperatures in Vermont would make it the ideal choice for a bike ride, free from the scorching heat and risk of overheating."
149	6127	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot. In the morning when he began his trip, he was eager and determined to get to his destination. Although it took him forty miles to get to the first ìtownî, he didnít seem to mind. ìThe cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,î is what crossed his mind once the sun began to beat down. Meaning that he didnít mind or wasnít troubled by it at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter, and less water supply he had left. Once he passed a couple of ìtroubling sightsî, because they were abandoned and no one was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1íS FISH CAMP, his emotions, and mind changed from begin lugubvious, to becoming thankful. The sight of the camp brought him relief and gratitude as he knew he would be able to replenish his supplies and rest before continuing on his journey.
150	6128	3	3	During his cycling trip through Yosemite National Park, author Joe Kurmaskie faced a series of challenges due to the harsh setting. The extreme heat made him become dehydrated, with the sun beating down as he traversed the high deserts of California in June. He encountered a remarkably large snake on his path, further complicating his journey as he struggled to maintain his balance in his dehydrated state. Running out of water exacerbated the situation, and when he finally reached a water pump, the water was undrinkable due to its scalding temperature of around 100 degrees. The deserted nature of the area made it difficult for Kurmaskie to find a suitable spot with clean water to rest and rehydrate, forcing him to continue for miles before finally finding relief. The unforgiving conditions of Yosemite National Park tested Kurmaskie's endurance and resourcefulness, highlighting the importance of preparation and caution when exploring such challenging environments.
151	6129	3	3	"The features of the setting were very affective in the story ""Don't Exceed Speed Limit."" It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to rolling hills. That's going to be hard to pedal a bike on. Another way the setting affected the cyclist is when tumbleweeds were in his way. If they get caught on the bike, it could cause him to fall and harm him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead, which could be hard to ride over potholes and bumps like that. Therefore, the setting was affecting to the cyclist. Additionally, the challenging terrain and obstacles added suspense and tension to the story, making the cyclist's journey even more thrilling and perilous."
152	6130	3	3	The features of the setting continue to impact the cyclist, transitioning from a sense of hope to despair. Initially, he found amusement in receiving directions from locals, but as he struggles with thirst and adversity, his laughter turns somber and despondent. Reflecting on the first town, he acknowledges the shift in his emotions, recognizing the dwindling energy to even feel sorry for himself. The evolving landscape and challenges along the way contribute to his changing perspective and emotional state, highlighting the relentless toll of the journey on the cyclist.
153	6131	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" written by Joe Kurmaskie, the hills in the setting had a significant impact on the author. The speed limit made him feel like he was moving too slowly, as evidenced by the line, ""I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1."" The challenging terrain and restrictions on speed created a sense of frustration for the author, highlighting how the features of the setting influenced his experience. The hills not only presented physical obstacles but also affected his perception of his pace on the road. This interaction between the author and the setting added depth to the narrative, showing how external factors can shape one's journey. Overall, the hills and speed limit played a crucial role in shaping the author's perspective as he navigated the road ahead."
154	6132	3	3	This is how the setting affects the cyclist. The hot dry California desert heat is making him hot and thirsty, depleting his water supply. The water from the well is not potable due to the extreme heat, leaving him with only a few sips in his bottle. The scorching sun and lack of water challenge him, making it difficult to heed the advice of the old timer. The harsh conditions force him to reflect on the wisdom of patience with age and the impulsiveness of youth. The relentless heat becomes a test of his will to survive, shaping his journey both physically and mentally. In this unforgiving environment, the cyclist learns valuable lessons about endurance, preparation, and the resilience of the human spirit.
155	6133	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long, and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didnít have much water to drink. Additionally, the lack of shade and shelter in the desert made it challenging for the cyclist to take breaks and rest. The extreme heat also caused him to become dehydrated quickly, adding to the difficulty of his journey. The presence of snakes on the road posed a potential danger and forced him to remain vigilant at all times. Overall, the harsh desert setting presented numerous obstacles for the cyclist to overcome during his ride.
156	6134	3	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. ìI arrived at the first ìtownî. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.î He is saying that the town couldíve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. ìI pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldnít cool down.î A working water pump wouldíve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading. The cyclist was faced with the harsh reality of his surroundings, where even the most promising features offered no respite from his challenging journey.
157	6135	3	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is ìflat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be ìhigh deserts of California in June.î Thatís saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the ìsummer timeî its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist will face challenges such as fatigue and heat exhaustion due to the hilly terrain and scorching temperatures of the California desert in June. These conditions will significantly impact the cyclist's physical exertion and overall experience during the ride.
158	6136	3	3	The features of the road, such as the terrain, incline, and obstacles, can significantly impact the cyclist's experience. Downhill roads may allow for faster speeds, while uphill roads may require a slower pace. Additionally, rough surfaces, like bumps, rocks, or grass, can present challenges for the cyclist to navigate. Ultimately, the cyclist's performance and enjoyment are closely tied to the characteristics of the road they are riding on.
159	6137	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by intensifying his desire for water. As he encounters tumbleweeds and a large snake, the dryness and heat of the environment make him acutely aware of his thirst. Seeing a sandblasted image of a boy enjoying a refreshing drink further emphasizes his craving for a cold beverage. These elements in the setting amplify the cyclist's need for hydration, highlighting the harsh conditions he is navigating.
160	6138	3	3	In ìRough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the cyclist was affected by the features of the setting. She was first impacted by the old men who gave her a ìshortcutî to Yosemite National Park. Then she faced ghost towns with no water supply. Later, she encountered a rickety road with tumbleweeds and a large snake blocking her way, leaving her almost dehydrated. Finally, she reached ìGary and Wilberís fish camp,î where she took charge of her decisions. These elements in the setting had a negative influence on the cyclist, except for ìGary and Wilberís fish camp,î which rescued her from dehydration.
161	6139	3	3	"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert. One thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" The setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a dessert traveling many miles. Additionally, the scorching sun beating down on the cyclist's back would make the journey even more challenging. The combination of the intense heat, lack of water, and remote location created a sense of urgency and desperation for the cyclist, adding to the tension and suspense of the story."
162	6140	3	3	The settings of a cyclist can significantly impact their performance. Factors such as weather conditions, the stability of the bike, and the surrounding environment all play a crucial role in determining how well a cyclist rides. For example, hot weather can cause a cyclist to slow down due to the sun's intensity, while cold weather may require additional clothing that could hinder speed. The condition of the bike, including the road surface, braking system, speed capabilities, and chain health, also affects performance. Additionally, the mood of the cyclist can be influenced by the scenery around them; a beautiful landscape may uplift their spirits, while a dark and gloomy setting could dampen their mood. Overall, the settings in which a cyclist rides can have a profound impact on their overall experience and performance.
163	6141	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The desert climate of the location burrows down upon the cyclist, making the already challenging journey even more difficult. As the cyclist continues on his route, he faces not only the scorching heat but also the lack of any place to get water. The combination of intense heat and dehydration becomes a serious threat to the cyclists' survival. In this harsh setting, the cyclist must summon all his determination to push through and continue on his journey. He must keep going, hoping that a town will appear soon so he can restock on water and rehydrate. The unforgiving desert setting forces the cyclist to confront the harsh reality of his situation and pushes him to his limits. Only with unwavering perseverance and a bit of luck can he hope to make it through the rough road ahead."
164	6142	3	3	"Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a ""ghost town"" where there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist came across the bait shop he knew he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water."
165	6143	3	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is dehydration. In the story about dehydration it says, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June."" A good effect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad effect on him was, ""Don't ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh."" One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake. ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake--It really did look like a diamondback.. Blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The cyclist faced various challenges during his ride, from dehydration to encountering a dangerous snake. These obstacles tested his endurance and decision-making skills, highlighting the unpredictable nature of outdoor adventures."
166	6144	3	3	The cyclist, unknowingly following the wrong information, found himself in a challenging situation during his journey. The scorching sun beat down on him, causing dehydration and making the ride even more arduous. The unexpected encounter with a large snake further added to his fear and uncertainty. Riding in the summer heat without adequate preparation, the cyclist struggled to navigate his way through unfamiliar territory. Despite these obstacles, he pressed on, determined to find his way and reach his destination. The series of unexpected events tested his resilience and adaptability, but ultimately, he continued forward, hoping to eventually find the right path and complete his journey successfully.
167	6145	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page  it says, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" This gives a sense of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he'll have later on. As he passes a snake, ""trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" So the cyclist is most likely beginning to feel dizzy and begins to lose hope. On page , he says, ""I could drop from heatstroke,"" meaning he's starting to think of the worst possible things that could happen. Which affects him because he's beginning to lose hope and thinks he's not going to make it. On page , he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" By this point, the conditions he was facing were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story."
168	6146	3	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindî (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of nowhere, that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hillsî (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body, it must have been hard going up and down those hills. @PERSON1 also said, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (@PERSON1). Dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work. The challenging terrain and harsh conditions made it a tough journey for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of proper preparation and staying hydrated in such environments."
169	6147	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, ìwiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirage.î It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down. The scorching heat made it difficult for the cyclist to continue on their journey, causing them to struggle with exhaustion and dehydration. The intense summer heat created a challenging environment for the cyclist, testing their endurance and pushing them to their limits. Despite the harsh conditions, the cyclist persevered, determined to overcome the obstacles in their path. The unforgiving heat of June posed a formidable challenge, but the cyclist's determination and resilience ultimately allowed them to conquer the grueling conditions and reach their destination.
170	6148	3	3	The features of the setting also affected the cyclist in terms of navigation. Without knowing where he was going, he had to rely on the directions given by other people, which could be unreliable at times. This added an element of uncertainty to his journey, making it more challenging to reach his destination. Additionally, the hot weather in California during June posed a risk of dehydration, forcing the cyclist to constantly stay hydrated to avoid any health issues. Overall, the setting of California in June had a significant impact on the cyclist's experience, influencing his physical well-being and navigation throughout his journey.
171	6149	3	3	The features of the settings in ìDo not exceed the posted speed limitî by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through Todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehydrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î He had nowhere to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster than birds would pick him clean. The essay ìrough road ahead: do not exceed the posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cyclist are very independent. The harsh conditions faced by the biker in a desolate area like Todi, California highlight the perseverance and self-reliance required for such journeys. The isolation and lack of resources emphasize the need for careful planning and preparation when embarking on solo cycling adventures.
172	6150	3	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that couldíve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.
173	6151	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces challenges due to the setting. He heeds the advice of an old man and finds himself on the wrong path, leading to a difficult journey. Traveling on a hot June day in the California deserts, he realizes the odds are against him. His water bottles only hold a few sips, his shirt is marked with rings of dried sweat, and the threat of heatstroke looms. Despite these obstacles, the cyclist pushes on, demonstrating resilience and determination. The harsh environment tests his endurance, but he perseveres through the struggle. The setting significantly impacts the cyclist, highlighting the harsh realities of nature and the strength required to overcome them."
174	6152	3	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...î This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip. The challenging terrain and remote surroundings make for a tough and adventurous journey for the cyclist, adding an element of unpredictability and excitement to his ride."
175	6153	3	3	The affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight and he had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he was going 12 miles per hour just like the waterflow. He was riding up and down rolling hills. He finally got to the next town to live. The town was small, with dusty streets and a few scattered buildings. The people there were friendly, welcoming him with open arms. It was a fresh start for him, a new chapter in his life. The sun was setting as he found a place to stay, feeling a sense of peace and contentment wash over him. Finally, he had found his place in the world, surrounded by the beauty of the desert and the warmth of the community.
176	6154	3	3	The setting of the essay affected the cyclist as he found himself lost after asking for directions from some elderly individuals. The winding roads and unfamiliar landmarks led to confusion, causing him to lose his way. Despite his best efforts to follow the instructions given to him, the cyclist found himself further from his intended destination. The peaceful countryside setting that initially seemed charming and picturesque now felt daunting and disorienting. As he pedaled on, trying to retrace his steps, the cyclist realized the importance of being well-prepared and self-reliant when venturing into unknown territory. In the end, he managed to find his way back with the help of a map and a friendly local who pointed him in the right direction. This experience taught him a valuable lesson about the impact of one's surroundings on their journey and the importance of being equipped to handle unexpected challenges.
177	6155	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. The hot and bumpy terrain made him sweat and tired, while also causing him to run out of water due to his thirst.

The harsh conditions of the setting create a sense of urgency and danger, making it a formidable test for the cyclist to endure.
179	6157	3	3	"The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the town he isnít really worried, he is kind of laughing and thinks he's funny by saying, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war."" Then after he says that, it weighs on him, and he chuckles. When he gets to the dark road with the risky pipe of water, he begins to switch into conservation mode and starts to get scared. He says, ""I would come for water- a test at my inner spirit."" This shows that he is scared. After he sees the abandoned Grape Juice Factory, he mentions that birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind some expensive biking gear. This definitely shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who give him directions. When he finally reaches the bait shop, he is relieved and goes to the bathroom to drink water. He also mentions that he will buy bait even though he doesnít have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist."
180	6158	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, it might be necessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story, there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. This factor does not help the cyclist at all; in fact, all it does is make the cyclist more exhausted. Another element in the story that affects the cyclist is the lack of water.

The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to add to his misfortune, ""flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills."" Although the hills are short, they still could have an impact on him because of the repetitive hills. Many features of the story affected the mood of the story."
181	6159	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they misled him into thinking he was making progress when he was not. The first town he reached appeared deserted, making him realize that he had been misinformed by locals who had never ventured beyond their homes. This experience taught him the importance of not blindly following outdated advice, as it could lead to disappointment and wasted effort. The desolate town served as a stark reminder that appearances can be deceiving, prompting the cyclist to be more discerning in his future travels.
182	6160	3	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park greatly affected the cyclist.

A bumpy road can cause discomfort and slow down the cyclist's progress. In addition, coming across a deserted town with no water available can be a major challenge for a thirsty cyclist. The warning signs of a rough road ahead and a ghost town further emphasize the tough conditions that the cyclist may face. Without access to water in a deserted town, the cyclist's thirst will only worsen, making the journey even more arduous. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and ability to complete the ride successfully.
184	6162	3	3	Hot, lack of water, and being lost all had a significant impact on the cyclist. The scorching sun beat down on him, making him sweat profusely and feel like he was in an oven. The lack of water left him desperate and struggling to find a source to quench his thirst, affecting his performance. Additionally, being lost due to a faulty map added to his challenges and made the journey more difficult than he had anticipated. Despite these obstacles, he persevered and eventually found relief. This story serves as a reminder that with determination, resilience, and a willingness to adapt, one can overcome adversity and achieve success in various aspects of life.
185	6163	3	3	The conditions the cyclist has to face are always problems or helpers. Say there is a rocky up-hill part. That will most definitely slow him down. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part that will speed him up and take a lot of work of pedaling off his hands. In essence, the terrain plays a crucial role in either hindering or aiding the cyclist's progress.
186	6164	3	3	The cyclist's hope dwindled as he found himself in the desolate California desert in the scorching heat of June. Coming across a rusty water pump dispensing water with a taste akin to battery acid only added to his despair. The warning sign about a rough road ahead, urging not to exceed the speed limit, made him acutely aware of the dangers surrounding him. With no signs of life in sight - no buildings, cars, or any form of civilization - the cyclist grappled with a profound sense of loneliness, convinced that his fate was sealed in the unforgiving desert. The harsh conditions and stark isolation instilled a deep sense of fear and uncertainty, leaving him to confront the harsh reality of his predicament.
187	6165	3	3	"In ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î While this may not directly characterize the weather, the reader can envision a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the ìghost townî followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read ìRough Road Ahead,î his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î As he trudged on, the sun beating down mercilessly, each pedal stroke becoming more arduous, Kurmaskie's determination and resilience were put to the ultimate test. The unforgiving landscape seemed to stretch on endlessly, with no relief in sight. However, despite the overwhelming odds stacked against him, he pushed through, showing that even in the face of adversity, one can find the strength to persevere."
188	6166	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist as exhaustion began to take its toll on him. The scorching heat added to his struggle, causing him to sweat profusely and leading to dehydration.
189	6167	3	3	To begin with, a feature that affected the cyclist was a lack of water. This is evident when the speaker mentioned that when they tried a drop or two, it tasted like battery acid. This lack of hydration was one of the biggest factors that the cyclist had to contend with during their journey. Without access to clean and refreshing water, the cyclist faced the risk of dehydration, which could have serious consequences on their health and performance. Staying properly hydrated is crucial for any cyclist, especially when embarking on long and arduous rides. In this case, the absence of water presented a significant challenge that the cyclist had to overcome in order to continue on their journey.
190	6168	3	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers, he faced many issues and learned a lesson. As he rode into the daybreak of morning, he had strong legs and a smile on his face. However, as time went on, he found himself running low on water and energy under the scorching summer sun. The fear of birds picking at his body if he collapsed on his way to Yosemite loomed over him.  When he finally reached a town, he refreshed himself and realized the importance of being prepared and self-reliant on his journey. He decided to start following his instincts and finding his own way to different places, taking the lessons learned from the old-timers with him. With a renewed sense of determination and independence, he continued on his adventures, ready to face whatever challenges came his way.
191	6169	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit"" affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more he rode, the more negative and doubtful he became. The cyclist lacked confidence and thought he wouldn't make it. When he saw nothing in sight, his tone changed. ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine."" He seemed unsure and nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist lost hope. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary."" He couldn't see himself finishing this journey in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except ""Rough Road Ahead"" signs. The desolate setting and lack of visible landmarks intensified the cyclist's negative thoughts and feelings of hopelessness."
192	6170	3	3	The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had any water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him become dehydrated. Another obstacle that he faced during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he had to conquer. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, but now he has hills that he has to pedal up, making it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he encountered was a snake that he ran into. The setting had many challenges for this guy. If it wasn't for the intense heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier.
193	6171	3	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclistís most challenging problem because they were long and crippling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatstroke. However, the cyclist kept a positive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and Wilbells fish camp.î In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination, you can accomplish anything!"
194	6172	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit."" The cyclist's mood seems to change as the road and setting do. The narration states, ""a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit... sometimes life can feel so cruel"" (Kurmaskie). Slowly, as the terrain gets harder and harder, the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town, he gets happy, but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist, making him tired due to lack of water and the sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die. The challenging road and setting contribute to the emotional and physical struggle the cyclist faces, mirroring the ups and downs of life's obstacles."
195	6173	3	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said ìI wipe the sweat from my eyes.î Additionally, the uneven terrain of the road also played a role in challenging the cyclist's journey. The bumps and potholes on the path required him to constantly adjust his speed and focus on maintaining balance. All these elements combined to create a physically demanding and mentally engaging ride for the cyclist.
196	6174	3	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a desert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn't help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it tougher on the cyclist because it drained what little energy he had left. The sun beating down on him made his body warmer and made it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do. The harsh conditions of the desert environment truly tested the cyclist's endurance and determination, pushing him to his limits as he struggled to navigate the challenging terrain and scorching heat.
197	6175	3	3	"In the setting of ""Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning, the author is enjoying a nice campground outside Lodi, California when ""old-timers"" give the cyclist directions. They sounded confident as they pointed out landmarks and towns along the route. Relying on their information, the cyclist sets off on their journey. However, the experience turns out to be challenging, as the rough road ahead makes it difficult to maintain a steady speed. The cyclist is forced to slow down and navigate carefully to avoid any accidents or damage to their equipment. Despite the initial excitement of the journey, the warning to not exceed the speed limit proves to be crucial for the cyclist's safety and well-being on the road. As they continue on their way, they are reminded of the importance of following road signs and regulations, especially when faced with unexpected obstacles. The lesson learned is valuable, as it helps the cyclist reach their destination safely and enjoy the rest of their travels with a newfound sense of caution and awareness."
198	6176	3	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when the old guy had told him do you know where to go? An the other guy was like ì yes sir! I own a very good mapî so how did it change for the man that was riding this bike he saw all of those towns an a sign that said Rough Road ahead. That the man would always stick to the future. What had change was he saw all of those buildings, town, an he was going an going. I think he might stick with the future. As the cyclist navigates through the towns and encounters the sign warning of a rough road ahead, the changing landscape and various features of the setting can impact his journey. The presence of different buildings, towns, and potential obstacles like rough roads can influence his route and decisions. Despite these challenges, the cyclist seems determined to continue moving forward, suggesting that he is focused on the future and committed to reaching his destination.
199	6177	3	3	In the story, the cyclist faced many problems, with one of the biggest being the challenging terrain he had to maneuver through. The hilly landscape made it difficult for him to ride his bike, as going uphill required more energy and effort, wearing him out faster than on flat land. The scorching heat of the desert also posed a significant challenge, making it hard for him to focus and draining his energy. Despite these obstacles, the cyclist persevered, pushing forward through the rolling mountains and barren landscape in search of water. The lack of civilization around him meant there was no opportunity to refill his water supply, adding to the difficulty of his journey. Ultimately, it was his unwavering determination and willpower that saw him through, allowing him to overcome the harsh terrain and reach his goal of obtaining the water he needed to complete his trip.
200	6178	3	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritated towards the old men. The old men give the cyclist directions, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However, their information is out of date, leading the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist expends all his energy getting to unknown towns of no importance, with no access to water. He blames the old men for wasting his energy by giving him misleading directions. However, he acknowledges his fault for not using a credited map for real directions. Ultimately, the cyclist learns the importance of relying on accurate sources for guidance in unfamiliar territories.
201	6179	3	3	The setting in which a cyclist rides plays a crucial role in their overall experience. It significantly impacts their enjoyment, safety, and even performance on the bike. The environment, terrain, weather, traffic conditions, and scenery all contribute to the quality of the ride. For some cyclists, a serene countryside with rolling hills and picturesque views may be the ideal setting. Others may prefer the challenge of urban streets with bustling activity and varied terrain. Ultimately, the setting can make or break a ride for a cyclist, shaping their connection to the sport and their sense of fulfillment. Therefore, choosing the right setting is key for a truly satisfying cycling experience.
202	6180	3	3	"In the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, ""enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening."" This quote describes the scenery as a serene or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, ""enjoyed."" One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cheery mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scenery affected the cyclist by making him happy. The same can be said for dreary scenery too. This is found when the author says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" This quote describes the scenery as a place where tumbleweeds are found. Stereotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely places. This lonely scenery takes its toll on the cyclist. He becomes pessimistic and is thinking of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. In conclusion, the setting does affect the cyclist and his mindset drastically."
203	6181	3	3	The cyclist struggled as the setting transformed from a flat, wide open road to short, rolling hills. Running low on water, the challenging terrain made it harder for him to muster the willpower to continue. The sight of vast lands with only tumbleweeds and large snakes intensified his feelings of despair. Under the scorching sun, his dehydration fears loomed large. Desperate, he resorted to using pebbles to stimulate his dry mouth, even wishing for a choking hazard to end his suffering. Feeling utterly powerless, he longed for relief from the harsh conditions surrounding him.
204	6182	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer's day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, ""I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June."" This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except ""Old timers who haven't left the confines of their perches since water was in offing."" The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they were obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting. The harsh summer conditions and unreliable directions from locals made his journey challenging and potentially dangerous."
205	6183	3	3	"The terrain in ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie presented various challenges for the cyclist. As he struggled with dehydration and fatigue, he encountered rolling hills that demanded more energy to conquer. The transition from flat roads to undulating terrain further depleted his already limited resources. Additionally, the appearance of tumbleweeds in the desolate surroundings heightened the sense of isolation and difficulty. Overall, the harsh environment posed significant obstacles for the cyclist to overcome, adding to the already arduous journey."
206	6184	3	3	"In the story ""Rough road ahead,"" the setting greatly impacts the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by the lack of water, the long distance he has to travel, and the challenging hilly terrain. ""The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,"" this statement illustrates how he was running out of water and feeling exhausted and overheated. The setting plays a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience throughout the story."
207	6185	3	3	The cyclist faced challenges during his ride due to the lack of water, intense heat, and rough terrain. The scarcity of water drained his energy levels, making it difficult for him to continue. The oppressive heat added to his struggles, causing him to feel overwhelmed and on the brink of exhaustion. The unforgiving terrain, full of steep hills, further tested his endurance and made the journey even more arduous. Despite these obstacles, the cyclist persevered, pushing himself to overcome the difficulties and reach his destination.
208	6186	3	3	In this I will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. One way is the heat caused him to drink more than he ran out of water. The next was is the misleading old guys that gave him bad directions. Another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down. The last reason is the snake that slowed him down. Additionally, the rough road conditions also made it challenging for the cyclist to maintain a steady pace. The combination of these factors made the journey even more arduous for the cyclist, testing his endurance and determination. Despite facing these obstacles, the cyclist persevered and eventually reached his destination, highlighting his resilience and dedication to completing the ride.
209	6187	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it. The lack of resources made it difficult for the cyclist to sustain himself during the journey. The absence of water and food meant he had to rely on his own supplies, making the trip even more challenging. The isolation of the setting also meant there was no help nearby if he encountered any problems. Despite these challenges, the cyclist persevered and successfully completed his journey.
210	6188	3	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. For example, the condition of his jar can impact his ability to navigate through rough terrain or uneven surfaces. If the jar is in poor condition, it can lead to discomfort or even injury for the cyclist. Additionally, the weather and terrain of the setting can also affect the cyclist's performance and overall experience. Riding in extreme heat or cold, or on slippery or muddy trails, can present challenges that the cyclist must navigate carefully. Therefore, it is important for cyclists to consider the features of the setting and make any necessary adjustments to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride.
211	6189	3	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. Thatís all I can really tell you. Because personally I donít think the setting of where you ride your bike doesnít even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I donít even think so. The environment in which a cyclist rides can greatly impact their experience. A scenic route with beautiful views may inspire a rider to take their time and enjoy the surroundings, while a challenging terrain with steep hills can push a cyclist to test their limits and improve their skills. Additionally, factors such as weather conditions and traffic levels can also influence how a cyclist feels during their ride. Ultimately, the setting plays a significant role in shaping the overall cycling experience, whether it be for leisure or training purposes.
212	6190	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist, as he found himself surrounded by nothing but endless rolling hills and abandoned buildings. With no sign of water, people, or hope in sight, he felt a sense of despair creeping in. However, as he pedaled on, he eventually reached a bend that signaled a change in his fortune. With his troubles, thirst, and fear left behind, he found a renewed sense of hope and determination. The setting played a crucial role in shaping his experience, highlighting the impact that surroundings can have on an individual's mindset and perseverance.
213	6191	3	3	Theres many features of the setting that affect the cyclest. His dehidration started with the sun beeting down on him and the thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and road by an abbanond welchs grape juice factory. ìA sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.î Then when he had almost nothing left he spoted a bait shop.î Somehow I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.î Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.î @CAPS1 is when he saw ìGary and @CAPS2 Fish camp ñ If you want bait far the big ones were your best bet thus realcaving his troubles. The cyclest's journey was a rollercoaster of emotions, from despair to relief, as he navigated the harsh setting in search of water and respite. Through sheer determination, he overcame the challenges posed by the unforgiving environment, finding solace in unexpected places along the way.
214	6192	3	3	The features of the setting that the author cycles through definitely affect not only his mood, but his physical condition. Starting in the high deserts of California in June, the hot weather causes him to sweat as he bikes along. As he approaches rolling hills, the change in terrain makes it more challenging to bike. When he sees a sign warning of a rough road ahead with a speed limit he cannot even reach, he becomes discouraged. Passing the rough road, he sees a picture of a boy drinking juice on a factory sign, which only intensifies his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated. These surroundings played a significant role in the author's change in mood and physical state throughout his journey.
215	6193	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor.

In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story. The cyclist struggled to overcome the challenges presented by the harsh environment, pushing himself to his limits in order to survive.
216	6194	3	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldnít drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. ìWhen I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acidî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. ìthe growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,î (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically. The harsh conditions of the desert put him at risk physically, mentally, and emotionally. The unforgiving heat, lack of resources, and treacherous terrain all contribute to his challenging journey. In such an environment, every decision becomes crucial, and the consequences of missteps are amplified. The setting serves as a formidable opponent to the biker, testing his endurance and resilience at every turn.
217	6195	3	3	The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, ìIt didnít really matter. I was going to dieÖî. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally. The harsh environment tested the cyclist's endurance and will to survive, pushing him to his limits. The oppressive heat and lack of resources made it challenging for him to continue on his journey. The setting not only posed physical obstacles but also took a toll on his mental state, causing him to contemplate giving up. The cyclist's struggle in the unforgiving desert setting highlights the power of nature to impact human resilience and determination.
218	6196	3	3	"The ways that can affect the cyclist by the setting of the place are how the road is shaped or riding up the hills and the roughness of the road. There was a sign that said, ""rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit."" If the cyclist didn't see it, they could have gone over the speed limit or not known the appropriate speed, resulting in potential injury. Since roads are primarily designed for cars, it can be challenging for cyclists to adhere to speed limits meant for vehicles. It is crucial for cyclists to pay attention to road signs and adjust their speed accordingly to ensure their safety while riding."
219	6197	3	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting significantly affects the cyclist. The first setting, where he ran out of water in the hot weather, made him feel dehydrated and like he might suffer from heatstroke. When he came across an abandoned juice factory, the thought of his thirst made him even more parched and disappointed. Finally, when he found water and quenched his thirst, the setting provided relief and satisfaction to the cyclist. The different settings played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's physical and emotional state throughout his journey."
220	6198	3	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected of the lack water, the heat and the bad directions, throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men. ""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride. ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men. ""Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh."" The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."
221	6199	3	3	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist. The sun beating down relentlessly caused the cyclist to struggle in the intense heat. As a result, they found themselves reaching for their water bottles more frequently, trying to stay hydrated in the hot and dry environment. The extreme conditions made it difficult for the cyclist to continue, pushing them to the brink of exhaustion. The setting posed a real threat to the cyclist's well-being, highlighting the importance of being prepared for the challenges of the environment.
222	6200	3	3	"The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obstacles in his journey but he still made it. Nature was most definitely not on his side that day. He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he got through the hills, he came to a sign: ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" Now he has to go through bumpy roads. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed his path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. Thankfully, he got by the snake, alive. Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view. The man thinks he found someplace to get water, but it's an abandoned building, by the looks of it - and had been a Welch's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. Despite the challenges and unexpected encounters, the brave cyclist persevered and continued on his journey, showcasing true determination and courage in the face of adversity."
223	6201	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says “the sun was beating on me” this shows it was hot. That's one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated. The intense heat can also cause the cyclist to sweat more, leading to further dehydration. Additionally, the hot weather can make the air feel heavy and difficult to breathe, making it harder for the cyclist to maintain a steady pace. Overall, the hot setting poses significant challenges for the cyclist, impacting his hydration levels, energy levels, and overall performance.
224	6202	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the setting as he encountered old timers who gave him incorrect information about a shortcut he planned to take. This led to him running out of water and energy, causing him to doubt himself and consider giving up on the race. The challenging conditions of the setting, combined with the misinformation he received, created a sense of frustration and uncertainty for the cyclist. Despite these obstacles, he ultimately persevered and continued on with the race, demonstrating his determination and resilience in the face of adversity.
225	6203	3	3	"In the piece, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist felt black humor, despair, and then relief due to the features of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, as it was ironic where he found himself - a hot desert in need of a drink, passing a closed juice factory. This irony sparked his black humor. The cyclist felt despair due to the vast emptiness around him, with no signs of life in sight, making him feel like survival was impossible. However, he eventually found a bait shop, bringing him relief. As he saw signs of life, his feelings of thirst and fear dissipated, leaving him with a sense of relief. The features of the setting determined the cyclist's emotional journey throughout his ride."
226	6204	3	3	"In the essay ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî by @PERSON1, many features of the setting affect the cyclist. When he arrived at the first ""town"" and remarked, ""this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war,"" the deserted ghost town setting had a mild effect on the cyclist as he still had a good water supply at the beginning of the day. However, as he approached the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps, the sight troubled him. Getting on his hands and knees to work the pump, only a drop or two that tasted like battery acid came out, making the situation even more challenging. Eventually, when he reached an abandoned Welch's Grape juice factory after several miles, the low water supply and a string of disappointments took a toll on him. The setting portrayed in this essay seemed abandoned and hopeless, requiring sheer determination to push through it."
227	6205	3	3	The cyclist pushed through the intense heat, feeling his water supply depleting rapidly. He questioned the directions he had been given to Yosemite National Park, realizing he was now lost and running out of time. Dizziness set in as dehydration took its toll, making him uncertain if he would ever reach his destination. As he struggled to pedal on, he knew that exceeding his limits in such conditions could have dire consequences. He had to make a tough decision - push on and risk his health, or find a way to replenish his water and continue at a safer pace. The posted speed limit was there for a reason, a reminder to stay within boundaries that could protect him in situations just like this.

234	6212	3	3	It the short story ìRough Rode Aheadî a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough. One narrator states ìI eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The narrator is really taking a beating from the travel and this rocky, dry climate is really taking a toll.

Like the title states the setting of this story was a ìRough Road Ahead.î In this challenging environment, the cyclist struggles to endure the harsh conditions and makes his way through the unforgiving landscape in hopes of reaching his destination at Yosemite National Park.
235	6213	3	3	The setting significantly impacts the cyclist's experience, as riding in a hot location with limited water resources can be challenging. If the cyclist had been in a different location or season, such as @LOCATION1 in June, the conditions may not have been as harsh. However, starting out in a hot place with scarce water has undoubtedly affected the cyclist's journey.
236	6214	3	3	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the heat of California, and difficult condition of the path he was on. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with having the lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it were not so hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition. The scorching sun beating down on him made his dehydration even more severe, with every drop of sweat sapping away precious fluids from his body. The relentless uphill climb required immense physical exertion, causing his muscles to ache and his breath to come in short, ragged gasps. The absence of any water sources along the trail only added to his distress, as the parched landscape offered no relief in sight. Despite his determination to push forward, the combination of extreme heat and dehydration was taking its toll on his body, leaving him feeling weak and lightheaded. In such unforgiving conditions, even the most experienced cyclist would struggle to endure, highlighting the critical importance of proper hydration and preparation when embarking on challenging rides.
237	6215	3	3	The cyclist in the article almost died from dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his misadventure in a light-hearted, humorous way. I commend him for almost dying and laughing about it and then turning around and blaming it on old people. He is an inspiration for reckless young folk. Oh yeah, and the setting was a desert. The scorching sun beat down on him as he pedaled through the arid landscape, his water supply dwindling with each passing mile. Despite the danger he faced, he managed to find humor in the situation, making light of his near-death experience. His ability to laugh in the face of adversity is truly admirable, and serves as a reminder to all of us to find joy even in the most challenging circumstances. It is also a stark warning of the dangers of underestimating the harsh conditions of the desert, and the importance of being prepared when venturing into such unforgiving terrain. In the end, his tale serves as a cautionary yet entertaining reminder of the power of resilience and humor in the face of danger.
238	6216	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" time setting significantly impacts the cyclist's journey. The scorching heat of the sun on that day made it even more challenging for him, especially when he ran out of water with nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around. As he became increasingly thirsty, the harsh desert landscape added to his struggle. Additionally, encountering a sign warning of a rough road ahead further complicated his situation. However, upon reaching a peaceful camp where cold water was available, he felt rejuvenated and replenished. All these elements of the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience throughout the story."
239	6217	3	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirtier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead, he started to get worried and kinda paranoid, so thatís how the setting affected him.

Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says ìOver one long, crippling hillî, heís saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.
241	6219	3	3	The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. If any of the settings features affected the cyclist(which they all did) This had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader leaves that the author was ìtravelling through the high deserts of California in June.î My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year This would have greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult. Additionally, the intense heat of the California desert in June would have also made it challenging for the cyclist to maintain a steady pace and keep his body temperature regulated. The scorching sun beating down on him would have caused him to sweat profusely, further contributing to his dehydration. The combination of the harsh terrain, limited water supply, and extreme heat would have pushed the cyclist to his physical limits, making his journey a true test of endurance. Ultimately, the setting of the California desert in June played a significant role in shaping the challenges faced by the cyclist on his journey.
242	6220	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didnít really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist.
243	6221	3	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow. Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him. Because the setting of the story was in the desert the cyclist was affected more then he had thought he would be. Due to the harsh conditions of the desert, the cyclist had to be extra cautious and prepared for the challenges he would face, making his journey more difficult and demanding than he initially anticipated.
244	6222	3	3	In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying  to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldnít have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. The challenging terrain required the cyclist to constantly adapt and be vigilant, making the journey more physically demanding and mentally taxing.
245	6223	3	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who havenít seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldnít have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldnít have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his ìdehydrated state.î I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldnít focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldnít get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite. As the cyclist struggled on his journey, the lack of accessible water sources in the abandoned towns posed a significant challenge, leading to dehydration and potential danger on the road.

Despite these obstacles, he knew he had to press on. The environment played a significant role in shaping his experience, affecting him both physically and emotionally throughout his journey."
248	6226	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near-death situation. He said ""sometimes life can be so cruel"" because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience. Also, a snake ""it really did look like a diamond back"" could have killed him. He was in the desert, and anything could happen. The setting of old men who didn't know anything and the heat could have killed the cyclist. The situation would have been different if it were anywhere else. The harsh conditions of the desert, combined with the presence of dangerous wildlife and the lack of resources, put the cyclist's life at risk. The unforgiving nature of the setting added to the tension and urgency of the situation, making it a life-threatening ordeal for the cyclist."
249	6227	3	3	"The cyclists problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by ""@PERSON1"" is dehydration and the California terrain is the cause. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in summer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable. In the story the cyclist says ìI could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in Juneî so the setting is obviously a hazard. The dry, arid climate of California poses a significant challenge for cyclists, especially during the hot summer months. With temperatures soaring above @NUM1 degrees, the risk of dehydration is high, making it essential for cyclists to stay properly hydrated while navigating the challenging terrain."
250	6228	3	3	The features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist, leading him to contemplate his mortality and face numerous challenges. Set in the California desert during early summer, the desolate and uninhabited environment instills a sense of hopelessness in the cyclist as he runs out of water. The absence of any signs of life in the once-thriving town only adds to his struggle for survival. Despite the odds, the cyclist perseveres, eventually reaching a fishing camp and learning a valuable lesson about not relying on outdated memories of a bygone era. Through this harrowing experience, he emerges stronger and more resilient, having conquered the unforgiving setting that nearly claimed his life.
251	6229	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the author was not and exhausted and as she was riding her bike there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle. The lack of water sources along the route made it challenging for her to stay hydrated and maintain her energy levels. As she pedaled through the barren landscape, the scorching sun beat down on her, intensifying her thirst and fatigue. Without any relief in sight, she had to push herself to keep going, knowing that dehydration could quickly set in. The unforgiving terrain offered no respite, leaving her vulnerable to the harsh conditions. In such a demanding environment, every pedal stroke became a test of endurance, highlighting the impact of the setting on the cyclist's physical and mental well-being.
252	6230	3	3	The road was deserted, with not a building, car, or house in sight. He was stuck in the middle of nowhere without any water or food, surrounded by the threat of poisonous snakes and the scorching heat that could make him collapse. The vast emptiness of the landscape seemed to stretch on endlessly, offering no respite or hope of rescue. As he stood there, feeling the weight of isolation and vulnerability, he knew that his only chance of survival would be to find a way to navigate through this desolate terrain and reach safety before it was too late. With determination in his heart, he took a deep breath and began to move forward, one step at a time, into the unknown.
253	6231	3	3	The cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her.

Despite these obstacles, the cyclist remains determined, pushing herself onward with the thought that if she can reach a certain point, she will be okay. Her perseverance pays off as she eventually makes it to a camp, proving that with determination and a positive mindset, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome.
254	6232	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the narrative. The author meticulously describes the various locations that the cyclist passes by, painting a vivid picture for the readers. Details such as ""one ramshackle shed and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule"" and ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite"" add depth and richness to the story.

The road became increasingly uneven, with potholes and debris making the ride uncomfortable. The man's car rattled and shook as he navigated through the rough terrain, regretting his decision to take the shortcut. Despite the challenges, he pushed on, determined to reach his destination. As he finally emerged from the rough patch, he realized that sometimes the shortest route is not always the best. From then on, he decided to stick to the main roads and follow the posted speed limit, avoiding any more unexpected adventures."
258	6236	3	3	"The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting. At first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a ""ghost town."" He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him.

While traveling, he starts to run out of water, and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean."" This quote means now that he is out in the desert, he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate for water as he is out in the desert in the middle of June."
260	6238	3	3	The features can affect the cyclist very well or not. It depends on what condition is happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit?

261	6239	3	3	"Setting is a very important element to the story ""Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply, and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration, and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wildlife can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence, so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative. If Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1, the story would not be as interesting."
262	6240	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, ìÖRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph.

It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration. Additionally, the occasional shade provided by trees along the road offered brief moments of relief from the scorching sun, giving the cyclist a chance to cool down slightly. Furthermore, the slight breeze that occasionally swept through the area helped in evaporating some of the sweat on the cyclist's body, providing a sense of temporary comfort. In conclusion, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, both in terms of the challenges posed by the harsh conditions and the opportunities for respite it occasionally offered.
266	6244	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is through the weather conditions, with the extreme heat leading to a lack of water for the cyclist. Additionally, the conditions alongside the road, such as tumbleweeds and snakes, pose further challenges. In such a hot and arid environment, the cyclist is at risk of dehydration, making the journey even more difficult. These factors combine to significantly impact the cyclist's experience and safety while riding through this challenging terrain.
267	6245	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the lack of cool water is a major challenge as it hinders his ability to reboost his energy, causing him to get tired more quickly. Even when water is found, it is hot due to the scorching desert temperatures. The rough road also poses difficulties for the cyclist, as indicated by the warning signs of a rough road ahead that limit his speed. These harsh conditions make the journey even more challenging for the cyclist, testing his endurance and resilience in the high desert of June.
268	6246	3	3	"The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes that the old men would have been right, had he been riding, before the last word war. But any town he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says, ""It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" He was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, but hope was fading. Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp."" The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven't moved from their front porches in years."
269	6247	3	3	"The harsh setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie made the journey for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistency of the pavement. The very hot June day caused the cyclist to slow down, with wide rings of dried sweat circling his shirt and the growing realization that heat stroke was a real threat. The summer heat was proving to be a formidable obstacle. Additionally, the inconsistency of the pavement, where flat roads were suddenly replaced by short rolling hills, added to the challenges the cyclist faced. Despite these obstacles, the determination to reach Yosemite kept the cyclist going. With perseverance and a positive mindset, he continued on his journey, ready to conquer whatever came his way."
270	6248	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hotness of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. Also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldnít stop. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist. As the cyclist continues on his journey through the scorching desert, he realizes the importance of staying hydrated and pacing himself to endure the extreme heat. The sight of the abandoned building serves as a reminder of the harsh and unforgiving nature of the desert, pushing the cyclist to continue onwards in search of civilization. Despite the challenges posed by the setting, the cyclist remains determined to reach his destination, fueled by the desire to conquer the harsh conditions of the California desert.
271	6249	3	3	"Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,"" was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the spring, for example, he might have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not encounter much civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. ""I was going to die,"" he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder. Additionally, the presence of sharp rocks and thorny bushes along the way made the cycling treacherous and physically exhausting. The relentless sun beating down on him exacerbated his dehydration, making each pedal stroke feel like an uphill battle. These unforgiving conditions tested his endurance and mental fortitude, pushing him to his limits. Despite the challenges, the cyclist persevered, determined to conquer the harsh desert landscape and reach his destination."
272	6250	3	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how ìI enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was parably assurance even thing would be fine. Confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out ìthis breezy jaunt.î The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I notices the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings @MONTH1 have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist succeeded. The challenges faced on the journey only served to make the eventual triumph all the more satisfying."
273	6251	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" This shows the cyclist did not have much confidence in this desolate area of the journey. The scorching sun beat down on him, causing his throat to parch and his body to weaken. The vast expanse of sand and rock stretched out endlessly, with no signs of life or civilization in sight. The cyclist's desperation grew as he pedaled on, each mile feeling longer and more treacherous than the last. As he struggled to keep moving forward, doubts and fears crept into his mind, threatening to overwhelm him. The harsh reality of his situation became painfully clear - survival was uncertain in this unforgiving landscape. With each passing moment, the cyclist's hope dwindled, his fate hanging in the balance as he pushed himself to the limit in a race against time and nature."
274	6252	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills. One example is on pg @NUM1 ìwith any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throatî. This explains the conditions of the road could be dangerous. That is how the condition of the road can be affective. Additionally, steep hills can also pose a challenge for cyclists, requiring more effort and skill to navigate. These natural elements in the setting play a significant role in shaping the experience and performance of the cyclist. It is essential for cyclists to adapt to the conditions of the road and terrain to ensure a safe and successful ride.
275	6253	3	3	"When the cyclist takes off on the road again he has plenty of water, strong legs and enjoys the sunny and warm day. But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terrain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me cleanî. This shows that by this time his confidence was lost because of the insane heat and unbearable terrain. He begins to lose his sanity along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible. As he continues to push forward, his mind is consumed with thoughts of his impending doom, the scorching sun beating down on him mercilessly. The once strong and confident cyclist is now a mere shell of his former self, fighting to stay alive in the unforgiving wilderness. With each passing moment, the fear of death looms larger, a constant companion in his struggle for survival. The harsh reality of his situation hits him hard, as he realizes that he may never make it out alive. But despite the overwhelming odds stacked against him, a glimmer of hope remains, a small voice urging him to keep pushing forward, to never give up. And so, with sheer determination and a will to survive, the cyclist presses on, his fate uncertain but his spirit unbroken."
276	6254	3	3	"The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts off, he is bright and happy just as the scenery is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face."" After about 20 miles on the road, his water supply was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. ""This site was troubling."" There he finds a water plant but his hopes rise a bit until he finds the water isn't good. ""A tar-like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water, feeling somewhat like it was in the neighborhood of two hundred trees."" So he moves on and finally he reaches a water source! He is so relieved he can't believe his luck. ""Then as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me."" The setting affects the mood in a very big way; the cyclist feels as the setting looks."
277	6255	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in various ways. The scorching heat and lack of water sources make it challenging for him to stay hydrated and energized. The presence of abandoned buildings and ghost towns adds a sense of isolation and uncertainty, making it difficult for him to find assistance or supplies. The combination of these factors creates a daunting and inhospitable environment for the cyclist to navigate through.
278	6256	3	3	Almost all of the cyclistís surroundings are old and barren. Hot @CAPS1 like weather. The road is hard to ride on. ìFlat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.î So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one. The dry, dusty landscape stretched out endlessly on either side of the road, with only a few scraggly bushes and cacti breaking up the monotony. The relentless sun beat down on the cyclist, making him feel like he was cycling through an oven. As he struggled to pedal over the uneven terrain, the once smooth road now punctuated by jagged rocks and potholes, he longed for the days of the flat, easy ride he had enjoyed before. The short rolling hills seemed to taunt him, never allowing him a moment of respite as he pushed himself to keep going. Each hill was a new challenge, sapping his strength and testing his endurance. Despite the harsh conditions, the cyclist pressed on, determined to reach his destination no matter the obstacles in his way.
279	6257	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by how much confidence in where heís going and how heís going to get there. Having no water source along the route can pose a significant challenge for the cyclist, especially on long rides. Proper hydration is essential for maintaining energy levels and preventing dehydration, which can lead to fatigue and decreased performance. Without access to water, the cyclist may need to plan their route carefully to ensure they can refill their water bottles at strategic points along the way. Additionally, the lack of water sources in the setting may also impact the cyclist's overall experience, as they may need to carry extra weight in the form of water bottles or hydration packs. Overall, the absence of water in the setting can significantly affect the cyclist's confidence and ability to complete their ride successfully.
280	6258	3	3	If the sun had not been so blaring, the road would not have been as treacherous. The intense heat made the journey unbearable, and the glaring sun rays obscured the path ahead. Additionally, the deviation in the route was a constant source of frustration for the author. Navigating through unfamiliar territory, the dry and dehydrated conditions only added to the challenges faced on the journey. Despite these obstacles, the author persevered, determined to overcome the adversities encountered along the way.

The setting, somewhere outside Lodi, California, in early summer, played a significant role in the cyclist's journey. The advice from some old men led him to difficult paths, and as the sun beat down and his water supply dwindled, the task of reaching Yosemite became more arduous.   The changing terrain, from flat roads to rolling hills, pushed the cyclist to his limits as he tried to make progress towards his destination. The hot air and intense sun quickly dehydrated him, making the journey even more challenging. After struggling over a particularly steep hill, the cyclist was forced to stop, attempting to distract himself from his thirst by sucking on a pebble.

The surrounding setting not only tested his endurance but also highlighted the importance of being prepared for the challenges that lay ahead."
285	6263	3	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically. Riding through the desert in June caused his water supply to run out quickly, leaving him with less energy. The abandoned town he was directed to by old men forced him to continue on despite his weakening state. The most impactful moment was when he reached the bait store, as finding it abandoned would have led to his demise. The factory he encountered also had a mental impact on him, with the image of the boy drinking juice haunting him as he struggled with dehydration. Dealing with these harsh conditions took a toll on the cyclist, as he experienced the familiar symptoms of dehydration - headaches, dry mouth, desperation, and dizziness. The environment he was in greatly influenced his physical and mental well-being throughout his journey.

Before he got to the fish camp, the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated. This caused him to lose hope, and at some points, he thought he was going to die. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way. As he continued on his journey, the desolate landscape seemed to stretch on endlessly, with no signs of life or civilization in sight. The oppressive heat beat down on him, draining his energy and sapping his will to continue. With each passing moment, the cyclist felt more and more isolated and hopeless, as if he were the only person left in the world. The barren surroundings only served to deepen his despair, pushing him to the brink of giving up. The harsh conditions of the setting weighed heavily on the cyclist, casting a shadow of doubt and fear over his mind. The lack of human presence and basic resources amplified his feelings of loneliness and desperation, painting a bleak picture of his chances of survival.

289	6267	3	3	"The setting of the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist's physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay, the cyclist ""rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face."" It was not too hot yet in the morning, so the cyclist was happy and strong, confident he could conquer anything. As the day progressed, ""the sun was beginning to beat down,"" and he started drinking lots of water to combat the increasing heat. Despite the rising temperatures, he maintained his confidence and strength.  However, as the cyclist rode on, he encountered a ""ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps,"" a troubling sight in the hot deserts of California. The once confident cyclist started feeling tired and thirsty, realizing the challenge ahead. With limited water supply, he had to conserve it for survival.

290	6268	3	3	"As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & excited to have been offered new directions from some ""old wise men"" which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, until he realizes the directions are way off target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first ""town"" but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old ""codgers"" would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert with a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his pain & despair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt screwed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physical, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old ""codgers"" on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be outdated. He vowed to always trust his own instincts and judgment when it came to navigating his way through unknown territory, no matter how tempting a shortcut may seem. Ultimately, he emerged from the ordeal stronger and wiser, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead on his cycling adventures."
291	6269	3	3	The cyclist's water consumption was directly influenced by the temperature and the distance he traveled. As the heat increased, he found himself drinking more water to stay hydrated. In addition, the longer he rode, the more fatigued he became, causing his body temperature to rise, leading to an increased need for water. This cycle of heat, exhaustion, and hydration created a symbiotic relationship between the setting and the cyclist, impacting his overall performance and well-being on the journey.

293	6271	3	3	"The hot, dry, and barren setting had a significant impact on the cyclist as he attempted to make his way to Yosemite national park. Following the advice of a couple of old men who were out of touch with the current conditions turned out to be a mistake. ""Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades,"" the cyclist lamented. The scorching heat and lack of water sources in the barren landscape made staying hydrated the cyclist's biggest challenge."
294	6272	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way was because of the lack of water. With the cyclist having a limited amount of water, it affected him greatly. The cyclist listened to the old men's advice and traveled a good distance, but the lack of water made matters worse. With a long distance to go and little water, the cyclist resorted to sticking pebbles in his mouth to try to forget about his thirst. He couldn't help but think about the possibility of dying from dehydration, imagining the birds picking his bones clean. The conditions of the road also added to his difficulties. Starting with straight roads, he later encountered challenging hills to navigate. In conclusion, the cyclist faced numerous obstacles that made his journey much harder than he had anticipated.
295	6273	3	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist because the hilly terrain makes it challenging to ride, especially in the hot and dry climate with no water sources nearby. Additionally, being in an area with no buildings or people around can be unsettling and cause fear and uncertainty. Overall, the harsh setting of the cyclist's journey contributes to his feelings of being lost and vulnerable, adding to the tension and suspense of the story.
296	6274	3	3	During the cyclist's journey, he was faced with many challenges. Mostly, the driver was reckless and he was running out of water. When he arrived at the first town, he was in search of water and realized that the place might have been a thriving little spot at one time, perhaps before the last world war. This scarcity of resources affected the cyclist greatly as he was desperate for water. Another feature of the setting that impacted the cyclist was the intense heat, which led to heatstrokes. Throughout his journey, there was not a single car or building in sight, making it even more challenging for him to find help or shelter.
297	6275	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the lack of sunlight in the desert. These environmental factors drained the cyclist's energy supply, making it challenging to continue the journey. The rough terrain and scorching heat of the desert posed significant obstacles for the cyclist, causing fatigue and slowing down progress. With limited energy reserves remaining, the harsh setting made it even more difficult for the cyclist to push through and reach their destination. The challenging conditions of the setting ultimately tested the cyclist's endurance and perseverance on the grueling journey.
298	6276	3	3	As if along bike ride through the city isnít grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. ìHigh deserts of California in June.î @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gear he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.  The challenging terrain, scorching climate, and lack of hydration made this bike ride a true test of endurance. With each hill climbed and each drop of sweat shed, the cyclist pushed through the grueling conditions, determined to conquer the unforgiving elements. In the end, it was not just a physical journey, but a mental one as well, proving that sometimes the toughest rides lead to the most rewarding experiences.
299	6277	3	3	The cyclist's performance is significantly affected by the lack of water, causing him to slow down. Moreover, receiving directions from older individuals may not be entirely reliable as their knowledge might be outdated. It is crucial for cyclists to have access to adequate hydration and accurate guidance to ensure optimal performance and safety during their journey. Being prepared with the necessary resources and up-to-date information can greatly enhance the overall cycling experience and help prevent potential setbacks along the way.
300	6278	3	3	The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. “Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice…” (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it. The warm breeze carried the scent of freshly cut grass, mingling with the sounds of laughter and clinking glasses. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the scene as the group of men continued their lively banter. With each passing moment, the sense of recklessness and adventure grew stronger, fueling their actions and decisions. As the night wore on, the line between reality and illusion blurred, making it easy to succumb to the intoxicating atmosphere. And so, like a foolish youth caught in the throes of excitement, the protagonist found himself swept away by the whims of the evening, unaware of the consequences that awaited him the next morning.
301	6279	3	3	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but going through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an effect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigued. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to go through tough weather but hazardous conditions too. There were times when tumbleweeds crossed his path and a ridiculously large snake. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see, this was a difficult journey for the reader and affected the cyclist. The challenging environment made the journey even more arduous, testing the cyclist's endurance and determination. Despite the obstacles, the cyclist persevered, pushing through the harsh conditions to reach his destination.
302	6280	3	3	The cyclist is surrounded by harsh features that greatly affect him. The hills, rough terrain, sand, and tumbleweeds create a desolate and lifeless environment that amplifies his feelings of despair. The old, rusty water pump, unused for ages, spews out black tar, further emphasizing the bleakness of his surroundings. Everything around him is dry and vivid, reflecting his negative outlook on life. In this barren landscape, the cyclist is consumed by thoughts of death, with no signs of life to offer him hope.
303	6281	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, ìThis place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. Iíd feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, ìconserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.î It made him think the situation wasnít good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways.
304	6282	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the author utilizes features of the setting to highlight the challenges faced by the cyclist. When the rider receives directions from two old men on a perch, the author warns against blindly following their advice due to their outdated perspectives. This emphasizes the idea that places and circumstances can change over time, influencing the reliability of guidance provided. Additionally, as the cyclist navigates a shortcut, he nearly runs out of water, forcing him to conserve and rely on his inner strength to endure the terrain. Despite encountering steep, rolling hills that intensify the struggle, the cyclist's determination shines through as he perseveres towards his destination. The author effectively conveys how the setting contributes to the cyclist's hardships, showcasing the resilience and resolve required to overcome such obstacles."
305	6283	3	3	The cyclist's confidence in their experience and knowledge was bolstered by the familiar features of the setting. Having navigated similar situations before, they felt well-equipped to handle the challenges at hand. This sense of familiarity and understanding of the environment gave them the conviction to assert their expertise and advocate for their perspective. Ultimately, the cyclist's interactions with the setting reinforced their belief in their own capabilities and strengthened their resolve to stand their ground.
306	6284	3	3	After the cyclist spoke to the old timers who hadn't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office, his confidence in them began to wear. He entered the desert happy, hopeful, and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal, and a couple of water pumps, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps, and it was hot and tasted like battery acid. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He traveled through the desert, encountering a ridiculously large snake, and was running low on water. Finally, he saw a building in the distance, which ironically turned out to be an abandoned juice factory, with a sign featuring a person sipping on some succulent icy liquid teasing ruin, causing him to lose hope. He didn't think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. However, after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy were rekindled.
307	6285	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. For example, the rough road didn't allow him to arrive as fast, so he had to drive at a lower speed limit. Secondly, as he was driving through a desert, a large snake made its way onto the road, causing the man to have to ease past it while trying to maintain his balance in his dehydrated state. Once again, because he was traveling through the desert, he became overheated and started to become dehydrated due to the lack of water. Lastly, the fact that there were no buildings for miles left him lost and without anywhere to stop and ask for directions. These few features definitely had a significant impact on the cyclist, making his journey more challenging and uncomfortable.
308	6286	3	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his difficult journey to Yosemite. First, the old timers at the reservoir campground gave him poor advice, leading him to take a dangerous shortcut. The scorching sun in the high deserts of California caused him to quickly become dehydrated, despite his efforts to stay hydrated. The lack of water made him vulnerable to heatstroke and dehydration, putting his life at risk on his journey. The harsh conditions of the setting made the cyclist's journey to Yosemite much more challenging and treacherous.
309	6287	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the harsh setting significantly impacts the cyclist. Arriving at a desolate place with only a ramshackle shed and rusty pumps leaves the character feeling lost and bewildered.

The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, sapping away any moisture in the air. The cyclist could feel the dry heat enveloping him, making every breath a struggle. The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what theyíll do. The rough terrain posed a constant threat, with rocks and sand making the journey treacherous. Every pedal stroke had to be carefully calculated to navigate the unforgiving landscape. Despite the challenges, the cyclist pressed on, determined to conquer the harsh conditions and reach his destination. The desert may have been unforgiving, but his willpower was stronger.
312	6290	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he arrived in the first town, the water tasted like battery acid, causing the rider to conserve water more carefully. Additionally, the harsh conditions, such as the extreme temperature, made the journey more challenging for the cyclist.

314	6292	3	3	During the cyclistís trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals, and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the ìshortcutî was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, ì there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasnít anybody nearby to help him, and there wasnít any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskieís physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, ì the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.î This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life-threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake were two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grueling position. Kurmaskie's journey was truly challenging, with the combination of extreme heat, rough terrain, and isolation testing his physical and mental strength to the limits.
315	6293	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskieís, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. ìI eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This sentence from the text shows he is dehydrated, creating an obstacle he must face. Additionally, another bad effect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is the rough road ahead he had to face. ìROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.î If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign, I would dread knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily, the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."
316	6294	3	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.
317	6295	3	3	"The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun, no trees, and no water. The cyclist was also feeling lightheaded. In the story he said, ""I felt the growing threat that I could drop from heat stroke."" The harsh environment was taking a toll on his body, leaving him vulnerable to the dangerous effects of heat exhaustion. The lack of shade and water only intensified his struggle to stay hydrated and cool. As he continued to pedal through the scorching landscape, the relentless sun beat down on him, sapping his energy and making it increasingly difficult to keep going. The challenging conditions served as a stark reminder of the importance of proper hydration and preparation when facing extreme heat while cycling."
318	6296	3	3	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didnít have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didnít know much didnít help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel. The lack of hydration in the scorching heat made the journey even more challenging for the cyclist. Without proper guidance and resources, her endurance was put to the test as she struggled to find her way through the unforgiving terrain. The combination of physical exhaustion and misinformation made each mile feel like an endless struggle.
319	6297	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death. Additionally, the vast expanse of the desert made it difficult for him to find help, leading to a sense of isolation and despair. The harsh conditions of the desert also drained his energy, making it challenging for him to continue his journey. Ultimately, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experiences and decisions, highlighting the impact of environment on an individual's well-being and survival.
320	6298	3	3	The way the setting of the story helps the guy out a lot is by providing relief from the hot weather. Riding through the hot weather can be tiring and uncomfortable, but the cool pines and risum river offer a refreshing break. The shade from the pines keeps him cool, while the river allows him to replenish his water supply for the next leg of his journey. Overall, the setting of the story plays a crucial role in making his ride more enjoyable and manageable.
321	6299	3	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumbleweeds - all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumbleweeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he tries to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesnít want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete. The challenging terrain, lack of hydration, and physical exertion all combine to create a difficult and arduous journey for the cyclist.
322	6300	3	3	In ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, ìI chuckled, check my water supply, and movedî. Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a ìramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in Juneî. He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, ìTelling myself that if I could make it that far, Iíd beî. The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist. The challenging environment he faces gradually tests his resilience and determination, making each step more difficult than the last.
323	6301	3	3	In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isnít described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, ìthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.î The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isnít in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living, when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in. The changing landscape mirrors the ups and downs of the cyclist's journey, from carefree to desperate, highlighting the importance of environment in shaping human experiences.
324	6302	3	3	"The feature of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. When the essay states, ""The sun was beginning to beat down,"" it shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and can impact his ability to keep cycling while the sun beats down on him. Additionally, when he mentions, ""I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,"" it indicates that he was also dehydrated, causing him to go very slow due to the intense heat and lack of water affecting his ability to keep cycling in the area."
325	6303	3	3	I believe the cyclist is alone, and I think the old man should have shot him. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape your in you should even go on a really long rider on a bicycle. Engaging in such a strenuous activity without proper training and preparation can lead to serious health risks and accidents. It is important to prioritize safety and well-being when embarking on physical challenges, rather than pushing oneself to the limit without considering the consequences. In this case, the old man's decision to potentially harm the cyclist may have been a misguided attempt to prevent a dangerous situation from escalating. Ultimately, it is crucial to approach extreme physical endeavors with caution and mindfulness to ensure a positive and safe experience.
326	6304	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey, making it a challenging and strenuous experience.
327	6305	3	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" significantly impacts the cyclist in several ways. The barren landscape offers no shade, leaving the cyclist exposed to the scorching sun, leading to dehydration and an inability to focus. Additionally, the challenging terrain of rolling hills and deserts forces the cyclist to exert more energy, depleting his water supply and causing him to doubt his surroundings, fearing mirages. The presence of ghost towns along the route initially sparks hope for relief, only to disappoint the cyclist as he finds no respite, leaving him disheartened and contemplating the possibility of succumbing to the harsh conditions."
328	6306	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly on the cyclist's back as he pedaled through the vast expanse of the California desert. The lack of shade and unforgiving heat drained his energy rapidly, making each mile feel like an eternity. With nothing but dry, dusty terrain stretching out in every direction, the cyclist felt a sense of isolation and hopelessness creeping in. The combination of extreme temperatures, dehydration, and disorientation from unclear directions made the journey incredibly challenging and dangerous. As he struggled to push forward, the fear of running out of water and being stranded in the harsh desert landscape weighed heavily on his mind. Despite his best efforts, the relentless conditions of the setting threatened to overpower him, testing his endurance and resolve to the limit.
329	6307	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirt hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to get to your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and there's a big boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, influencing their journey and mindset throughout their travels."
330	6308	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says ìwide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadnít been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.î The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign ìRough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.î This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it. The intense physical strain and mental challenge faced by the cyclist in the scorching desert heat paint a vivid picture of the harsh realities of endurance sports. Such extreme conditions push individuals to their limits, testing their resolve and resilience in the face of adversity. The struggle to keep going despite the overwhelming odds serves as a testament to the human spirit's unyielding determination and unwavering strength.

Additionally, he had to navigate carefully to avoid a snake in his path, causing him stress and fatigue. The rough terrain caused his muscles to ache, and the scorching sun left him dehydrated. These challenges made his journey arduous and tested his endurance in the harsh environment.
332	6310	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because itís almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. Heís showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much heís in despair at the time. When he says ìIt was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.î In this quote he is saying that he may be tired and physically not be in his best shape but at least he knows heís not in a good shape and he knows heís in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text, in my opinion, is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.
333	6311	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is a desert. The desert is very hot. In the story, he mentions that it feels around 120 degrees. He struggled for water but couldnít find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had ""a tar-like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This means it was hot and he couldn't find water."
334	6312	3	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist.

335	6313	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states ìlooked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.î This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, ìit didnít really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.î This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The harsh environment took a toll on the cyclist, pushing him to his limits physically and mentally. Despite the challenges, he continued on, highlighting his determination and resilience in the face of adversity.

It is essential for cyclists to be aware of their surroundings and adjust their speed and technique accordingly to ensure their safety while riding.
337	6315	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the ghost town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better directions. The bait shop was a relief for the cyclist as he was able to replenish his water supply and receive accurate directions to continue his journey.

For example, when the author and their friend went biking in Fechmisburg, they encountered a steep hill that made their legs ache after a few pedals. This demonstrates how the terrain can affect the physical exertion required for cycling. The hilly landscape can present both challenges and rewards for cyclists, testing their endurance and providing scenic views. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cycling experience and adding an element of adventure to the journey.
339	6317	3	3	"There are many ways in which the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affects the cyclist.

As he continues on the ""shortcut"" recommended by the old men, he begins to question his chances of survival. The combination of extreme weather conditions and the unsettling history of the towns he encounters heightens the tension and danger that the cyclist faces on his journey. Ultimately, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and adding to the suspense of the story."
341	6319	3	3	The cyclist must navigate through different kinds of hills and watch out for rocks on the road. He needs to ensure he has enough water as he travels through the desert-like terrain. Despite the absence of cars, he must stay alert for any unexpected vehicles. The numerous turns in the road require his full attention. The scorching heat necessitates precautions against heatstroke. With no shade or stops along the way, he must be well-prepared for the journey ahead.
342	6320	3	3	The story highlights how the condition of the road can impact the mood of a cyclist. When confronted with a sign warning of a rough road ahead and instructing not to exceed the speed limit, the cyclist's anxiety was evident. This feeling of unease was further heightened when a snake appeared, causing the cyclist to proceed cautiously to maintain balance despite being dehydrated. The harsh, dry climate only added to the challenges faced by the cyclist, making the journey even more arduous.

Riding a bike over long distances without adequate supplies can be extremely draining, so it's crucial to plan such trips carefully.
344	6322	3	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the beautiful summer weather. He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that's not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California. The challenging conditions of the California landscape, combined with the scorching heat and lack of water sources, posed a serious threat to the cyclist's well-being.
345	6323	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn't in the high deserts of California in June, he probably wouldn't be dehydrated. If he was in a different location, such as in a cooler climate, like @DATE1, it wouldn't be as hot out. Additionally, if there weren't short rolling hills, he would have had more energy. It is evident that the setting plays a significant role in impacting the cyclist's experience and performance.
346	6324	3	3	There were many features that affect the cyclist. Lack of water slowed him down. Also, the hills and sun were a big problem.

Despite the obstacles posed by the setting, the cyclist persisted, pushing through the discomfort to reach her destination. In the face of such adversity, her determination and resilience shone through, highlighting the strength and tenacity required to navigate challenging environments.
349	6327	3	3	"In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left the first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stopped at a fork in the road he had just to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. As he progressed further in his trip, he came to a sign that said ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit."" This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then, as he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gas store. When he arrived, he got some water and got directions from a man who had the best map.

The harsh environment, lack of water, intense heat, and rough terrain all contributed to the cyclist's distress and near-death experience."
351	6329	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination, and relief. For example, he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time. He was also determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, that also makes him relieved, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist. The challenging terrain, unpredictable weather, and unfamiliar surroundings all contribute to the cyclist's emotional journey as he navigates through the unknown. As he overcomes each obstacle, his feelings of doubt are replaced by confidence, his determination grows stronger, and ultimately, he finds relief in reaching his destination.
352	6330	3	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, ""sometimes life can feel so cruel"", he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, ""somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" At the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his outlook drastically changed depending on setting through his journey."

However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The first town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with depleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again. After this challenging journey, the cyclist learned the importance of relying on reliable sources and not taking shortcuts that may lead to unforeseen obstacles. It was a tough lesson, but one that would stay with him for all his future adventures."

The cyclist states, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, ""I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me"" (Rough Road Ahead).

360	6338	3	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is necessary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terrains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal. For example, the text says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" By using vocabulary such as ""tantalizing"" expresses the cyclist's need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence, the narrator makes a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for suggesting the path. Readers can also conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. The lack of water in such conditions posed a significant threat to the cyclist's well-being, highlighting the importance of proper hydration during strenuous physical activities."
361	6339	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water. Despite the challenges, the cyclist persevered and successfully completed his journey, demonstrating his determination and resilience in the face of adversity.
362	6340	3	3	"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclistís mood was determined by the setting as well as his needs and his determination to make it. The setting of the story was early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old menís advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his determination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [heíd] be fine."" For the cyclist, the setting's effect was negative. The challenging environment tested his endurance and resolve, pushing him to the limit of his physical and mental strength. Despite the hardships he faced, he pressed on, determined to overcome the obstacles in his path."
363	6341	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist faced various challenges that affected his journey. The scorching sun made him hot and tired, making it difficult to continue riding. Additionally, the bumps on the road made pedaling more strenuous and exhausting. Trying to pump water from a rusty pump further drained his energy. These features significantly impacted the cyclist, leading to fatigue and potential difficulty in completing his ride."
364	6342	3	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a ìshortcutî that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination. As he pedaled through the challenging terrain, his muscles burned with exertion, but his resolve remained unshaken. Despite the obstacles in his path, he kept his eyes on the prize, pushing himself to the limit to overcome each hill and curve in the road. With each pedal stroke, he drew closer to his goal, fueled by the determination to prove the old men wrong and show that he could conquer any challenge that came his way. And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, he reached his destination, a sense of accomplishment washing over him as he realized that he had not only completed his journey but had also proven his strength and perseverance in the face of adversity.
365	6343	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in the middle of June in the high deserts of California that reach up to 100 degrees, he would have not gotten so dehydrated. In the middle of August in Antarctica, it barely reaches 32 degrees. Also, the desert is known to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else, every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in ìNo Man's Land"". Lastly, the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous since people never really drive through. No one regularly complains about potholes and such. They are more concerned about the cities where many people travel; there is no point in changing or filling potholes where no one really travels."
366	6344	3	3	"The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, ""over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view."" This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ""by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant."" These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist. The challenging terrain and the discovery of the abandoned grape juice factory added to the cyclist's struggle and further heightened the obstacles he faced during his ride."
367	6345	3	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says ìhave not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in officeî gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with a lot of water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite. The scorching heat of the desert made the journey incredibly challenging, with the sun beating down relentlessly on him. The lack of shade and water sources added to his struggles, causing him to ration his water carefully. Despite the difficulties, the cyclist persevered, determined to reach his destination. In the end, he learned valuable lessons about the importance of preparation and the unpredictability of nature in such harsh environments.
368	6346	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in them that could have caused him to get really hurt. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him. The setting was pretty barren for the cyclist because he also came across a snake. Lastly, he thought he saw some mirages that tell me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists. Thatís how the setting affects the cyclists. Additionally, the intense heat and lack of shade in the desert environment could lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion, posing a serious risk to the cyclist's health and safety. The rugged terrain and unpredictable wildlife also add an element of danger and uncertainty to the journey. Overall, the harsh conditions of the setting create numerous obstacles and challenges for the cyclists to overcome, making their ride a true test of endurance and resilience.
369	6347	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what heís doing in weather that he could, ìdrop from heatstroke.î @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that heís seeing a mirage of a ìbuilding-abandoned years earlier.î The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in. The extreme heat and barren landscape create a sense of desperation and isolation, highlighting the cyclist's struggle and determination to push through against all odds. The harsh environment serves as a stark reminder of the challenges he faces, both physically and mentally, as he continues his journey.
370	6348	3	3	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh terrains of the Midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1, which near him, quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. Behind these aspects make the use frol final much inorder  for the cyclist and gives the reader image as what he is going through. The scorching sun beats down on him as he navigates the endless stretch of road, his throat parched and his body drenched in sweat. The once gentle breeze has now turned into a relentless gust of hot air, making each pedal stroke feel like a struggle against the elements. The flat terrain gradually gives way to steep inclines, testing the cyclist's endurance and determination. Despite the challenges he faces, he presses on, driven by the desperate need to quench his thirst. The unforgiving landscape may seem endless, but the cyclist's resolve remains unwavering as he pushes forward in search of the precious water that will sustain him on his journey.
371	6349	3	3	In the article ìDo not exceed the posted speed limit,î the features of the setting took a toll on the cyclist in many ways. The dry, dusty desert environment made the sun beat down relentlessly, leading to severe dehydration despite the cyclist's regular intake of water. Traveling through the high deserts of California in June intensified his dehydration, causing him to fear for his life. When he stumbled upon an old abandoned juice factory, it only deepened his despair and hopelessness, driving him to push harder in search of water. Despite the harsh conditions, the challenging setting ultimately fueled his determination to survive and find the water he so desperately needed.
372	6350	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way was the weather. In the story, it said, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie). This indicates that the cyclist was in a desert, which is usually warm, especially in June. The hot weather made him become dehydrated due to lack of water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the surroundings. The text mentioned, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind"" (Kurmaskie). This lack of civilization around meant there was no help available if he got injured or needed water. The setting played a crucial role in the cyclist's journey, presenting challenges that he had to overcome."
373	6351	3	3	Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the high deserts of California in June. The blistering heat; high meaning it's going to be closer to the sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closest water supply was somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, there was a long crippling hill all while the sun was beating down. All of that would most obviously affect the cyclist by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing consciousness. The intense heat and lack of water would lead to dehydration and exhaustion, making it a challenging and potentially dangerous journey for the cyclist. The difficult terrain, including the long hill, would require extra effort and stamina, adding to the physical strain on the cyclist. Overall, the harsh conditions of the high desert in June would greatly impact the cyclist's experience and performance on this adventure.
374	6352	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist mentions the changing terrain, with flat roads giving way to short, rolling hills. This change in landscape forces the cyclist to exert more effort, especially when already exhausted and dehydrated on a scorching summer day. The intense heat, described as ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,"" adds to the challenge, making it difficult for the cyclist to focus on navigation and increasing the risk of getting lost without a reliable map. These harsh conditions highlight the importance of being prepared and staying hydrated while cycling in such demanding environments."
375	6353	3	3	As the cyclist continues his journey, he encounters more desolate places and individuals. He regrets trusting the old men he encountered, which led him through the unforgiving desert. Even in a car, the desert can be a daunting place, but on a bicycle, the isolation and lack of resources are even more daunting. The bleak landscapes only add to his sense of despair, as he passes through abandoned towns and encounters spoiled water sources. Every glimmer of hope is quickly extinguished by the harsh reality of his surroundings, such as having to pump for minutes only to obtain undrinkable water. Just as he feels his strength fading, he stumbles upon a place offering water, food, and shelter. However, his relief is short-lived as he finds another old man there. The cyclist's journey is fraught with challenges and disappointments, but he perseveres in the face of adversity.
376	6354	3	3	In the essay, the features of the cyclist play a crucial role in shaping the setting. The fact that he is navigating through a desert adds a layer of danger and urgency to his journey. When he reaches the grape factory, his near dehydration serves as a stark reminder of the harsh conditions he is facing. His decision to quench his thirst at the bait shop's faucet further emphasizes the extreme physical toll of his expedition. The cyclist's struggles in this unforgiving environment highlight the importance of being prepared and vigilant when venturing into such challenging landscapes. The setting, in this case, serves as a powerful backdrop that enhances the narrative of the cyclist's perilous adventure.
377	6355	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by their were rolling hills that went up and down and it to alot of streanth and also he barely had water because, it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. In the story it say when he was riding that ì He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.î This quote shows it was starting to get hot. Also, in the story he says ì I checked my water supply.î @CAPS1 means heís starting to realize his waters running short. So in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source, so  the cyclist is being affected by all of this. The challenging terrain, scorching heat, and limited water supply all contribute to the difficulties the cyclist faces as he navigates the unforgiving setting.
378	6356	3	3	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY. In such a harsh environment, the lack of water made it even more challenging to navigate through the desert on a bike. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, causing sweat to evaporate quickly, further depleting the body's water supply. With each pedal, precious energy was expended, and every drop of water became invaluable. The unforgiving terrain stretched endlessly in all directions, offering no respite or signs of civilization. Survival depended on careful rationing of resources and strategic planning to reach the nearest oasis before it was too late. The setting truly tested the limits of endurance and determination, creating a gripping tale of survival in the harsh desert landscape.
379	6357	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supply while heading in the wrong direction. The challenging terrain made it difficult for him to pedal uphill, causing fatigue and dehydration. Additionally, the scorching heat added to his physical strain, increasing the risk of heat exhaustion. With limited water available, the cyclist faced the danger of becoming severely dehydrated, which could have serious consequences on his health. Moreover, going in the wrong direction not only wasted his energy and resources but also extended his journey unnecessarily. Overall, the setting presented numerous obstacles for the cyclist, making his ride more arduous and demanding than anticipated.
380	6358	3	3	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist's journey. The incorrect directions given by the elderly led to him getting lost, causing frustration and wasted time. The lack of water in the area forced the cyclist to resort to sucking on pebbles to try and alleviate his thirst, a desperate measure that only provided temporary relief. Additionally, the rolling hills in the landscape required the cyclist to exert more energy than anticipated, making the journey even more challenging. Overall, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, presenting obstacles that tested his endurance and adaptability.
381	6359	3	3	The cyclist felt a sense of relief as she pedaled around the bend, leaving her troubles, thirst, and fear in the past. The serene setting of the winding road surrounded by lush greenery and chirping birds created a peaceful atmosphere that enveloped her. The cool breeze brushed against her face, carrying away the stress and worries that had weighed her down. With each pedal stroke, she felt a renewed sense of freedom and liberation, as if the world had opened up before her. As she continued on her journey, the beauty of the scenery and the tranquility of the setting inspired her to keep moving forward, leaving her troubles far behind.
382	6360	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist found himself in the dry, hot hills of California, desperate for a drink. After being misled by old people who pointed him towards abandoned ghost towns with no drinkable water, he grew tired, thirsty, and dehydrated. In his search for water, he stumbled upon a bait shop that finally provided him with the much-needed relief."
383	6361	3	3	"During the cyclist's journey, he was affected by the setting frequently. As he cycled, the increasing heat of the sun began to take its toll on him, even though he initially didn't pay much attention to it. ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" This indicates that while he was aware of the rising temperature, it didn't immediately impact him. Additionally, he found himself constantly drinking water as he traveled through the high deserts of California in June. ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts in California in June."" This shows that the time of day and year influenced his need to stay hydrated. The setting played a significant role in affecting the cyclist during his journey, impacting his comfort and well-being."
384	6362	3	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it's bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you may not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt yourself very seriously. That's why riding a bike is dangerous. Also, if you're in the type of environment where everything is smooth then you can have a nice bike ride. It's important to consider the setting when riding a bike to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.
385	6363	3	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, ìDo not Exceed posted speed Limit.î By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, ìIt was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting. Ultimately, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the physical and emotional experiences of individuals in challenging situations."
386	6364	3	3	"The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land and the harsh features of the setting were so severe that he had no hope. For instance, when the cyclist expressed, ""I hope I make it to the horizon,"" it highlighted the desperation he felt as there was nothing else in sight to aim for. He couldn't even suggest riding to the next building or mailbox, as there were none to be found in the barren desert landscape. The desolate features of the desert made the cyclist feel utterly alone, with no one to offer assistance, ultimately leading him to believe that he would perish from dehydration. As the situation worsened, the cyclist's spirits plummeted even further when he stumbled upon the abandoned Welch's Grape Fruit building, realizing that even his faint glimmer of hope was extinguished. Just when all seemed lost, he stumbled into a fishing store and managed to have a sip of water, barely clinging to consciousness. In conclusion, the unforgiving features of the setting played a significant role in the cyclist's diminishing hope and struggle for survival in the harsh desert environment."
387	6365	3	3	The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites. Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive. The harsh environment of the desert and the challenging terrain of the hills drained the author's energy and made it difficult for him to continue his journey. In such extreme conditions, staying hydrated and maintaining electrolyte balance is crucial for survival. The author's struggle in this setting highlights the importance of being prepared and well-equipped when venturing into unfamiliar and demanding environments.
388	6366	3	3	The features of the setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states ìwith strong legs and a smile on my face.î As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kindî, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me cleanî As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.
389	6367	3	3	"In this story, ""No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. When it's a long downhill on cool roads, the cyclist is fine, but on straight uphill roads in extreme heat, he feels like he can't keep pedaling. The cyclist becomes very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around, so the setting has a huge effect on the mood in this story."
390	6368	3	3	A cyclist is a bike rider who can ride solo or with groups of people. Some cyclists cover a few miles, while others like to challenge themselves by going for longer distances, such as @NUM1 miles. They may ride through hilly terrains, cross water bodies, or explore various landscapes. Cycling requires dedication and time, as it can be physically demanding to cover such extensive distances. Cyclists enjoy the freedom and thrill of riding their bikes, pushing their limits, and experiencing the world around them in a unique way.
391	6369	3	3	The setting is hot like a desert, with no one around and very dry. The intense heat makes the cyclist sweaty and in desperate need of water. However, the lack of people around means he has no access to water, which is crucial for his journey. The scorching heat drains his energy, making it even more challenging for him to locate a source of water. The combination of the harsh environment and the absence of assistance weakens the cyclist, posing a significant obstacle in his quest for hydration.
392	6370	3	3	The setting can greatly impact a cyclist's experience, whether positively or negatively. If a cyclist is able to adjust the settings to their preference, it can enhance their ride. However, if someone else interferes with these settings, it can lead to a less enjoyable and potentially unsafe situation for the cyclist. It is essential for cyclists to have control over their own settings to ensure a smooth and safe ride.
393	6371	3	3	"In this narrative of a cyclist riding in California, heading for Yosemite National Park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a porch. The setting plays a big part in his challenge, from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the beginning of his ride, he passes a ghost town that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt, and he continues with caution. Then the pines that ""had my name written all over them"" give him hope and reassurance. However, the rusty pump and ramshackle shed take away the hope and reassurance, making him cautious. The hills make him work hard to get over, the snake slows him down, and the Welch's Juice Company that is abandoned all contribute to making matters worse. Finally, he finds some water at a bathroom, and everything starts to look up. If the setting had been the same the whole way, he wouldn't have had any hope, or if he did, it wouldn't have fluctuated, making the story less interesting."
394	6372	3	3	Winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist. First he gets very bad directions from a group of old men that have not been outside of their porch in awhile, then he goes through the first town and does not fill his water bottles. As he continues on his journey, he gets lost and runs out of water. Fortunately, he stumbles upon a fishing store where he is able to refill his water bottles and receives a better map from the kind people there. This new map helps him find his way through the winding hills, ensuring he doesn't get lost again. With his water replenished and better directions in hand, the cyclist is able to continue on his journey with confidence and determination.
395	6373	3	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay ìI could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story. The lack of water and direction significantly impacted the cyclist's journey, as he faced the threat of heatstroke without hydration and the risk of endless riding without a clear path ahead. These challenges added depth to his experience and emphasized the importance of preparation and guidance in any cycling adventure."
396	6374	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water so he began on his way he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didnít realize how hot it was until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated he rembered the old men said that the next town was abait eighteen miles away so he kept on going when he reached the town there was nothing to drink just an old run down factory. He took same rocks and sucked on them, he went over a bump had swallowed it. He said to him self next time he would just go by what the map said everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned. Finaly he reached a bait shop and when inside the bathroom and got some water. The challenging terrain and lack of resources in the desolate setting made the cyclist struggle with dehydration, highlighting the importance of proper preparation and awareness of one's surroundings when embarking on a journey.
397	6375	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example, it was hot and hilly, which made him easily dehydrated. Riding down a rusty, bumpy road only added to his dehydration. Additionally, he came across a stream where he could stop, rest, and plan the best route to his destination. These features of the setting played a significant role in influencing the cyclist's journey.
398	6376	3	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying ìit fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î This was in response to the first ìtownî he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine.
399	6377	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first ìtownî he is not too worried about it and moves on. ìI chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.î The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.î @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked ìand a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.î @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didnít seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the authorís moods. The author's emotions and reactions were closely tied to the environment he was in, with changes in his surroundings directly impacting his mental state.
400	6378	3	3	"The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story, the setting is a hot, dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start to have an effect on him after he reaches the first town. ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at the time - say, before the last war - but on that morning, it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down."" The summer heat is thriving during this time, and he is drinking lots of water. So, this setting does affect him greatly; it causes him to use his water supply and begin the process of dehydration. The summer heat can be intense during outdoor activities, and the cyclist is feeling the effects of it. But the hope of finding a building just around the bend keeps him going."
401	6379	3	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting proves to be extremely challenging for the cyclist, as he navigates through the high desert of California. The harsh conditions of the desert, combined with the lack of hydration, pose a serious threat to the cyclist's well-being. Pedaling over ""short, rolling hills"" only adds to the physical strain he is already enduring. To make matters worse, the trail set by a group of old men offers no respite in the form of water sources. The first town he encounters is a ghost town, devoid of any life or resources. The only water pump he finds spews out sewage and scalding brackish water, further exacerbating his dehydration. The sight of contaminated water along his path intensifies the cyclist's struggle to survive in the unforgiving desert heat. This combination of unforgiving elements in the setting pushes the cyclist to the brink of death, highlighting the dire consequences of underestimating the challenges of the environment."
402	6380	3	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The supply of water was harsh not much around at all and when he tryed to get water the pumps would pump out not water. The weather and water supply were two maijor affects on the cyclist. The road was another factor that impacted the cyclist as it was full of potholes and obstacles, making it difficult to ride smoothly and safely. The wrong estimation for old people also played a role in affecting the cyclist as he underestimated the physical demands of the journey on older individuals. In conclusion, the setting of the story, including the weather, water supply, road conditions, and wrong estimations, all had a significant impact on the cyclist's experience and journey.
403	6381	3	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my faceî. This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill."" After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely relieved to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever grateful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you can't even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water. The contrast between the initial happiness and the eventual distress in the story showcases the author's emotional journey and the impact of the unfamiliar and isolated setting on her experiences."
404	6382	3	3	The features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's experience. The cool water he refills his bottles with helps regulate his body temperature during the ride, keeping him hydrated and refreshed. Moreover, the rolling hills present a physical challenge, requiring him to exert more energy and strength to conquer each incline. These natural elements not only test his physical abilities but also enhance his overall cycling experience, making it both demanding and rewarding.
405	6383	3	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, short, rolling hills, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant uphill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn't much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble. The cyclist is facing a challenging situation that tests both their physical endurance and mental strength, as they struggle against the harsh elements and the seemingly endless terrain.
406	6384	3	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist. The challenging terrain, lack of water sources, isolation, and disheartening sight of the abandoned factory all added to the difficulties faced by the cyclist on their journey.
407	6385	3	3	The features in the setting dramatically affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in Callada, he wouldn't have dehydrated, but the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most important setting is the Welch's grape juice factory. He would have had all the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned, an ironic twist as he calls it. And the last one is the bait shop that saves his life, where an old man offers him directions. The cyclist's journey is a test of both physical endurance and mental resilience, as he navigates through challenging terrain and unexpected obstacles.
408	6386	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was in the middle of nowhere with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, making him feel exhausted and desperate for hydration. The lack of any signs of civilization in sight added to his stress and panic, as he felt uncertain about where to find the next refuge. This combination of physical discomfort and emotional distress made the setting a challenging and daunting obstacle for the cyclist to overcome.
409	6387	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story ìwho havenít left the confines of their porches since Carter was in officeî also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welchís factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain. The scorching sun beating down on him intensifies his thirst and fatigue, making each pedal stroke a struggle against the unforgiving elements. Despite the challenges he faces, the cyclist pushes forward, fueled by the determination to quench his thirst and reach his destination.
410	6388	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Additionally, the strong winds in the desert could have made it more challenging for the cyclist to maintain balance and control while riding. The sandy terrain might have also caused the cyclist to struggle with traction and stability, adding another layer of difficulty to the journey. Overall, the setting plays a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience and performance."
411	6389	3	3	"The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. ""One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldnít hold the lamest mule greeted me."" This could also cause a problem because he can't renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can't use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day."
412	6390	3	3	"The cyclist in, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" was greatly affected by the features of the setting. The hot weather made her feel exhausted and drained, while the lack of people around made her feel small and helpless. Additionally, the absence of water only heightened her feelings of thirst and desperation. Ultimately, the combination of these factors created a challenging and uncomfortable environment for the cyclist to navigate through."
413	6391	3	3	The setting further challenged the cyclist as he navigated the rough roads, struggling to pedal smoothly. His heart raced when he encountered a snake slithering across his path, sending a wave of fear through him. As he continued his journey, his water supply dwindled, and the only source he found tasted as unpleasant as battery acid. The harsh conditions of the environment made the cyclist's ride a true test of endurance and perseverance.
414	6392	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty, and causing him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June, and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" He also says, ""Over one long, crippling hill."" As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean."" When the cyclist finds the bait shop, he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop, he says, ""Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, ""Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me."" The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope, and confidence."
415	6393	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst and getting back on the road to go wherever he is trying to go. However, he did not mention getting bait for fishing. The cyclist was also affected because he almost died from thirst with no road in sight.
416	6394	3	3	He raced through the forest, his heart pounding with excitement, as he tried to reach Yosemite for a thrilling adventure on the rushing river. The sound of the water cascading over the rocks urged him on, pushing him to go faster and faster. The sun dappled through the trees, casting a golden hue on the path ahead, guiding him towards his destination. With each step, he could feel the anticipation building, knowing that soon he would be navigating the rapids and feeling the cool spray of the water on his face. As he finally emerged from the trees and caught sight of the majestic river, he couldn't help but smile in anticipation of the exhilarating experience that awaited him. The rush of the river beckoned him forward, promising an unforgettable journey through the wild beauty of Yosemite.
417	6395	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Having desert terrain can be discouraging, as the vast expanse of sand dunes may make one feel like giving up without knowing where the end point is. On the other hand, cycling through grassy, flowery lands can be invigorating, providing a sense of direction and encouraging the cyclist to keep exploring. The presence of hills and challenging terrain adds an extra level of difficulty, but also offers a rewarding workout and a sense of accomplishment. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's mindset and determination during their journey.
418	6396	3	3	"When the cyclist first received directions to Yosemite Park from the ""old timers"" he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life-threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist began his journey through the hot, June weather, he ""rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face."" As he continued forward, he noticed that there were no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passed abandoned towns and crept into the desert flatland. The flatland, however, morphed into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only was the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist was rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water made the cyclist think ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he was quickly replenished. ""Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp"" saved the cyclist from almost certain death and taught him to always just use his map. The experience served as a valuable lesson for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of being prepared and cautious when navigating unfamiliar territories."
419	6397	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the area the cyclist rides through greatly affect him. For example, when the narration says, ""At some point, humble weeds crossed my path"" (Kurmaskie). The tone of the cyclist from the quote above shows despair creeping into his mind. Another example is when the narration says, ""As I crested a hill, a building came into view"" (Kurmaskie). The cyclist sounds more hopeful than before. The surroundings play a significant role in shaping the cyclist's emotions and mindset throughout the journey."
420	6398	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is affected by many features of the desert, with the main one being the intense heat. Traveling through the high deserts of California in June, he is faced with scorching temperatures and a lack of water. His water bottles only contain a few sips, leaving him parched and exhausted. Despite his fatigue, he pushes on, knowing he has a long way to go. All the towns he passes through are deserted, adding to his sense of isolation and vulnerability. Finally, he comes across a bait shop where he is able to refill his water supply. Grateful for this stroke of luck, he promises himself to stick to the map in the future to avoid such dangerous situations. The harsh realities of the desert serve as a reminder of the importance of preparation and caution when traveling through unforgiving landscapes.
421	6399	3	3	In the essay, the setting plays a crucial role in affecting the cyclist in various ways. The challenging course, characterized by rolling hills and rough roads, contributed to his dehydration, making the journey even more demanding. Additionally, encountering dangerous animals like snakes added another level of risk and difficulty to his ride. These elements of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist's experience, highlighting the importance of considering environmental factors when embarking on such endeavors.
422	6400	3	3	The terrain described in this essay adds to the struggles of the cyclist. For example, when the author mentions that there were no cars nor buildings in sight, it emphasizes that he is truly in the middle of nowhere. Additionally, the effect is heightened when he stumbles upon an abandoned juice factory and, overcome with thirst, resorts to putting stones in his mouth to stimulate saliva production. Furthermore, when he finally finds water, an old-timer inquires if he knows the best route to take, adding to the sense of isolation and challenge faced by the cyclist in this remote landscape.
423	6401	3	3	In the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because itís June and that causes a lot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afraid of getting dehydrated. Also he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was losing my water. As he pedaled through the scorching desert, the relentless sun beat down on him, threatening to drain his body of precious fluids. The hilly terrain only added to his challenges, forcing him to exert even more energy and sweat profusely. With each passing mile, the cyclist grew increasingly aware of the importance of staying hydrated and conserving his strength in the unforgiving heat of the desert.
424	6402	3	3	"The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first ""town,"" he could tell there'd be some issue. It was a deserted, run-down area. The water was hot. Down the road, the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water. As he continued his journey, the rough terrain and lack of resources made it increasingly challenging for him to navigate through the harsh environment. The unforgiving setting was taking a toll on his physical and mental well-being, highlighting the significant impact of the surroundings on the cyclist's experience."
425	6403	3	3	I think it explains because they did a good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did the same thing wrong too. Their efforts were commendable, but there were mistakes made along the way that affected the overall outcome. It is important to acknowledge both the positive aspects and areas that need improvement in order to learn and grow from the experience. By recognizing and addressing these shortcomings, individuals can strive to do better in the future and achieve greater success.
426	6404	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Dehydration caused by the heat and not having enough water caused the cyclist to sweat and feel nauseous. ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh."" In this quote, he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in a bad state. This shows how the features of the setting can significantly impact the cyclist's well-being and safety."
427	6405	3	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirsty, which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also, the fact he was in the desert meant there were no trees to give him shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. In the ride, he struggled more than he thought he could, facing challenges brought on by the harsh conditions of the desert."
428	6406	3	3	"Some of the things that affect the cyclist were the lack of water. ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips; water is of big importance to strong men. Your body needs water to work right."" The hot, dry weather of California had a significant impact. ""The high deserts of California in June... I could drop from a heatstroke."" The sun was unbearable, especially without shade and water, affecting the cyclist. The absence of people or stores also made the journey challenging. ""There was no one in sight."" The presence of animals added to the difficulties. ""A large snake crossed my path... diamondbacks blocked the majority of the pavement."" Dealing with these challenges made the cyclist's journey more arduous."
429	6407	3	3	Rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts all present unique challenges for cyclists. The rolling hills require continuous effort and can quickly deplete the cyclist's energy reserves. In contrast, the open terrain offers little to no protection from the harsh sun, leading to increased fatigue and the risk of sunburn. Additionally, the high deserts pose a different set of obstacles, with long stretches of rough, dry terrain that can be physically demanding and mentally exhausting for the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the experience of the cyclist, affecting their performance and overall enjoyment of the ride.
430	6408	3	3	"In the case of the cyclist in the story, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting has an enormous effect on the biker. Primarily, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he ""had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" Additionally, he tries to get water from the old well, demonstrating just how much he needed water. The water in this pump, the owner said, was ""somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infers that it must be scorching outside. The author implied this when he says he is in California in June, on a searing day, and the sun was beating down.  Another aspect of the setting, the lonely, desolate land, had a large effect on the cyclist. As he looks around, he sees no signs of human life; ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This empty land made the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn't know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lost and alone.  The setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, from the scorching weather causing dehydration to the desolate land contributing to his sense of isolation and confusion."
431	6409	3	3	"There were many different conditions that affected the cyclist. He did not have the proper amount of water for the journey, which made it difficult. He states in the story, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" The terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and he arrived in a town. Despite the challenges he faced, the cyclist's perseverance and willpower ultimately allowed him to overcome the obstacles and reach his destination."
432	6410	3	3	"In the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist's journey is heavily impacted by the features of the setting he encounters. From the old town that he initially dismisses with a chuckle to the troubling sight of a deteriorating water supply at a fork in the road, the cyclist's confidence begins to waver. The sign warning of a rough road ahead further diminishes his hope, leaving him dehydrated and weary. However, upon reaching Gary and Wilber's fish camp, he finds a source of relief and renewed determination for the journey ahead. Just like in ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" by Kurt Vonnegut, where the character Billy Pilgrim faces numerous challenges on his journey, the cyclist's experiences in the setting shape his emotions and decisions, ultimately influencing the outcome of his adventure."
433	6411	3	3	Some features can affect the cyclist. The weather can slow them down like if it was cold or hot outside it can slow the person down. If the person does not take appropriate measures to adjust to the weather conditions, it can impact their performance. Cold weather can make it harder for muscles to warm up, leading to stiffness and decreased flexibility, while hot weather can cause dehydration and fatigue. Therefore, being mindful of weather conditions and making necessary adjustments can help cyclists perform at their best and stay safe on the road.
434	6412	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you canít see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.
435	6413	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns. In conclusion, the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist's experience, requiring heightened focus and skill to navigate safely through the challenging terrain.
436	6414	3	3	Setting can affect a cyclist in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehydrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy, and the dangers of poisonous snakes. The cyclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling off his bike, dehydration, and a bite from a snake. Say he was in the mountains of the Himalayas. There are many problems that face you there. The high altitude can cause altitude sickness, the steep and narrow roads can be treacherous, and the weather can change rapidly. In addition, the lack of oxygen at high altitudes can make it difficult to breathe, especially when exerting oneself. Therefore, it is important for cyclists to be well-prepared and aware of the challenges they may face when cycling in such a setting.
437	6415	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, as the high deserts of California posed a challenge. Not long into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change from flat roads to short, rolling hills. As he continued on, a large highway sign warning of a rough road ahead with a speed limit of 55 mph caught his attention. Sometimes life can feel so cruel, especially when faced with unexpected obstacles during a challenging journey like cycling through the unforgiving landscapes of California.
438	6416	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of their water because it was hot and they would get thirsty from all of that cycling. This led to dehydration and made it difficult for them to continue their journey. The harsh terrain also posed a challenge, with rocky paths and steep inclines making it hard to pedal. The cyclist had to navigate carefully to avoid accidents and injuries. Additionally, the lack of shade made it hard to find respite from the scorching sun, further adding to their discomfort. Overall, the setting presented numerous obstacles for the cyclist to overcome, testing their endurance and determination.
439	6417	3	3	"In the essay entitled ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit,"" the setting changes as does the mood of the essay and the cyclist. For example, towards the beginning of the essay, at the reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, the cyclist is happy, enjoying the serenity of an early summer evening. However, this changes when he gets directions from a couple of ""old-timers."" As he continues his journey, he arrives at a ghost town, with the sun beating down, making him worry about the lack of water and the long distance still ahead. The setting of the ghost town and the hot sun affects both the mood of the essay and the cyclist. The situation becomes even more dire when he reaches another ghost town with rusty water pumps containing acid-flavored water. With rolling hills, hot sun, and the sight of a diamondback snake, the cyclist fears for his life. But everything changes when he sees a sign for a baitshop, offering hope in the midst of his struggles. This demonstrates how the author, Joe Kurmaskie, effectively uses setting to influence the mood of the essay and the emotions of the cyclist."
440	6418	3	3	"The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, ""blues tune 'summer time' rattled around in my deteriorating brain."" The author has spent so long cycling through the heat that his brain is starting to shut down. Additionally, there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building and town, except the last one, is deserted. Without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it's the author versus nature. Moreover, as the author states, the directions came from old people who ""haven't left their porches since Carter was in office."" The world has greatly changed, with towns now turning into ghost towns and buildings rundown. However, the roads are still kept in shape, leaving the author to navigate through the deserted landscape on his own."
441	6419	3	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclistís attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, ìwith strong legs and a smile on my faceî. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older menís travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldnít help but laugh. ìIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. ìAt this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.
442	6420	3	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough, bumpy, and dangerous road, constantly on the lookout for animals that could attack him. With no water, he was quickly becoming dehydrated under the scorching sun. The poorly maintained road made his journey even more challenging, requiring extra energy to navigate through the rough terrain. The combination of these factors made his ride a grueling test of endurance and survival.
443	6421	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like he's coming or going on a vacation and because of the way he's riding it, it seems he's going real fast as about to fall. The vast expanse of the desert landscape adds to the feeling of isolation and freedom, with no other vehicles or people in sight. The dry, arid conditions also create a sense of intensity and challenge for the cyclist, as they navigate through the harsh environment. The speed at which the cyclist is riding reflects the urgency or thrill of the journey, enhancing the overall sense of adventure and risk in the setting.
444	6422	3	3	The cyclist is out in the desert there for was tired & also running out of water so he's getting dehydrated. As the sun beat down relentlessly, his throat felt parched, and his body was beginning to ache from the exertion. With each passing mile, the water in his bottle dwindled, and the thought of finding a water source became more urgent. The shimmering heat waves distorted the horizon, playing tricks on his fatigued mind. He knew he had to find shelter soon to escape the scorching sun before dehydration took its toll. The vast expanse of sand seemed never-ending, and panic started to creep in. Exhausted and desperate, he pushed on, hoping against hope for a miracle in the unforgiving desert.
445	6423	3	3	"The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the start he had a sense of excitement which dwindled once he entered the barren desert, but his spirits lifted when he came across a rest stop. An example of this shift can be seen in his words, ""I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait."" The overall mood of the story is heavily influenced by the author's emotions and experiences as he navigates through the changing landscapes and encounters different people along the way."
446	6424	3	3	"The features of the setting in this story, ""Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,"" affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there, like the writer describes, ""wide rings of sweat circled my shirt."" The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he ran out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water, he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed. The harsh, remote environment of the desert-like area in California was a significant factor in the cyclist's struggle and added an element of danger to his journey."
447	6425	3	3	"The setting very much affects the cyclist. ""I maneuvered down the hill."" This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasn't there then it would have been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there weren't any hills to get in his way, the cyclist could have reached his destination faster and with less effort. Hills can be physically demanding, requiring more energy and effort to navigate, making the journey more challenging. The presence of hills in the setting can significantly impact the cyclist's experience and overall performance."
448	6426	3	3	"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly affected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply. The text says, ""The sun was beginning to beat down"" (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising. The text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). The author's battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills. Seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it. Despite the challenges presented by the hot weather and difficult terrain, the cyclist persevered and managed to overcome the obstacles in his way."
449	6427	3	3	"In the start story ""Do not exceed speed limit,"" time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of California in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist’s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat caused the dehydration and the growing realization that I (the author) had to take immediate action to prevent further complications. The scorching sun beating down on the desert landscape added to the intensity of the situation, making it even more crucial for the cyclist to find relief. The harsh, unforgiving terrain of the desert only magnified the challenges faced by the cyclist in this difficult situation. The combination of extreme heat and lack of water sources made it a dangerous predicament that required quick thinking and decisive action to overcome. Ultimately, the time of year and place setting played a significant role in shaping the outcome of the cyclist's journey through the California desert in June."
450	6428	3	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with winding roads and hills peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging, with the rider having little to know way or the roads were ten times harder to deal with. And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for. The unpredictable weather further added to the challenges, with sudden gusts of wind making it difficult to maintain balance and heavy rain making the roads slippery and dangerous to navigate. The dense fog that occasionally rolled in obscured the path ahead, creating a sense of disorientation and unease for the cyclist.

The barren landscape seemed to stretch on endlessly, with no signs of relief in sight. The cyclist knew he had to conserve his energy and ration his water carefully to make it through this challenging journey. With each pedal stroke, he pushed himself forward, determined to reach his destination despite the harsh conditions.
498	6476	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too hot, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted like battery acid, and so that was no good for him. It was a flat land, then rolling hills. The next town would have been in the 20 miles. This cyclist was killing himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars, it was like a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions, he should never trust strangers on shortcuts.
499	6477	3	3	"On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their directions arenít so good. The deserted place affected him because there was nowhere for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle. ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There were rusted water pumps, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to a state of dehydration. He searched desperately for any sign of civilization, but all he could see was the vast expanse of barren land stretching out before him. The scorching sun beat down on him mercilessly, draining him of what little energy he had left. As he pedaled on, his throat grew parched, and his head began to spin. The cyclist knew he had to find water soon if he wanted to make it to his destination. With each passing mile, the situation grew more dire, and he felt his strength waning. Just when he thought he couldn't go on any longer, a glimmer of hope appeared on the horizon. A small oasis emerged, offering him the relief he so desperately needed. He rushed towards it, grateful for the chance to rest and replenish his water supply. In the end, the cyclist learned an important lesson about the unpredictability of nature and the importance of being prepared for any situation when embarking on a journey."
500	6478	3	3	"The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" Due to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling, he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also, there were no other travelers, so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal uphill, so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story, he writes, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn't find water, he may dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there may be water, but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope, but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tie into one another, creating a challenging journey for the cyclist."
501	6479	3	3	I really thought the story didnít make sense the setting was crazy I really wasnít feeling it at all I donít think it was even a good story. The characters seemed unrealistic and the plot was confusing. The overall atmosphere of the story was chaotic and hard to follow. I found it difficult to connect with the narrative or the message the author was trying to convey. In my opinion, the story lacked cohesiveness and failed to engage the reader. Overall, I was disappointed with the story and did not find it enjoyable to read.
502	6480	3	3	The features of the setting can greatly impact a cyclist's ride. Bumpy roads can make the journey more challenging, while hilly terrains can slow down progress. Animals in the area, such as snakes or squirrels, can also pose obstacles for cyclists. On the other hand, the presence of trees can provide shade and cooler temperatures, offering some relief from the sun. Additionally, access to amenities like fresh water streams can allow cyclists to refresh and hydrate along the way. Ultimately, the setting in which a cyclist rides can either enhance or hinder their overall experience.
503	6481	3	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end satisfaction came out of it all, he found himself stronger and more resilient than before. Through the struggle, he discovered his inner strength and determination, proving to himself that he could overcome even the toughest challenges. The experience, although difficult, ultimately became a source of growth and empowerment for him. It taught him the importance of perseverance and showed him that with dedication and resolve, he could achieve anything he set his mind to. In the end, the struggle was worth it, as it led him to a greater sense of self and a newfound belief in his abilities.
504	6482	3	3	The trees in the landscape turned a fiery red, contrasting with the towering volcanoes and the dense pine tree forests that blanketed the area. Many years ago, the once lush swamplands transformed into a barren desert.
505	6483	3	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement ìI was travelling through the high deserts of California.î not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement ìI was travelling in June.î @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, ìblackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also ìhad the flavor of battery acid.î This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he ìhad been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.î The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, ìThe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.î The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.
506	6484	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with ""His name written over them."" The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun beat down on the cyclist's back, making him drink his water away to sips. He was told by an old man that a town was only a few miles away, but upon reaching it, he found it to be a ghost town. This lack of hope for survival made the cyclist wary of trusting the old man's words. However, he was ultimately saved by a traditional map that helped him find his way."
507	6485	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, significantly impacted the cyclist's journey. The deserted town he encountered offered no resources for replenishing his limited water supply, making his travel through the humid weather even more challenging. The hilly terrain added to his exhaustion, highlighting the importance of a flat road for a smoother journey. This mirrors the struggles faced by the main character in the movie referenced, who navigated extreme conditions to reach his goal. Ultimately, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the difficulties the cyclist faced on his journey."
508	6486	3	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced challenges due to the setting. He encountered initially smooth terrain that transitioned into rolling hills, adding difficulty to his journey. Moreover, he had a startling encounter with a large snake while navigating the arid landscape. The cyclist's struggle was exacerbated by his dehydration, as he had run out of water in the desert-like environment. Despite these obstacles, his determination to find water kept him going."
509	6487	3	3	"In the selection ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" there are several key details that paint a vivid picture of the cyclist's surroundings. The mention of drinking water oozing out and tasting like battery acid indicates that the area is deserted and likely untouched for some time. Additionally, the fact that the cyclist is traveling through a desert in June highlights the harsh conditions and the level of thirst he must be experiencing. The description of traveling for miles over rough terrain and facing ""crippling hills"" emphasizes the physical exhaustion the cyclist is enduring. When he finally reaches the camp and finds water, the relief and gratitude are palpable, as he has finally reached a place that is not empty and deserted."
510	6488	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn't have much water. In the text it says ""I was traveling the high deserts of California in June."" The deserts are always hot, and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn't able to drink much because he had limited water. The scorching sun beat down on him relentlessly, causing sweat to pour down his face and dehydration to set in rapidly. The lack of shade or relief from the intense heat made his journey even more challenging. With each passing mile, the oppressive heat seemed to sap his energy, making it difficult to pedal on. The harsh conditions of the setting made it a grueling test of endurance for the cyclist, as he struggled to push through the unforgiving environment."
511	6489	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isnít any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay. The intense heat and dryness of the California desert in June created a challenging environment for the cyclist, leading to dehydration and exhaustion. The lack of immediate assistance in the deserted area added to the urgency of the situation. However, his determination to survive and perseverance paid off when he finally discovered a bait shop, providing him with much-needed refreshment and ensuring his well-being.
512	6490	3	3	The cyclist faced a challenging journey through the long rides, hilly roads, and very limited water supply. Despite these obstacles, he managed to keep his composure and remained calm throughout the ride. This demonstrates his resilience and determination to overcome adversity in the face of difficult circumstances. The harsh setting tested his physical and mental strength, but he persevered and ultimately succeeded in completing the ride. This experience likely taught him valuable lessons about endurance, patience, and the importance of staying focused on his goals despite the challenges he may encounter along the way.
513	6491	3	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welchís Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. ìThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,î describes the cyclist, ìbut on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the ìshortcut.î ìNot two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,î reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, ì By the looks of it- had been a Welchís Grape Juice Factory.î The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.
514	6492	3	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts during the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited terrain were the biggest struggles for the cyclist. He had expected to find many stops for water along his route, but he was mistaken. Quickly running out of water due to dehydration in the scorching heat, the cyclist became frustrated with himself for trusting someone else's directions for a shortcut. The harsh setting had a negative impact on the cyclist's mood throughout his journey.
515	6493	3	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, causing the cyclist's energy to deplete as he navigated the challenging terrain. Additionally, obstacles such as tumbleweeds and a large snake crossing his path forced him to come to a halt, further slowing down his progress. These elements in the setting significantly impacted the cyclist, making it difficult for him to maintain his pace and energy levels throughout the race.
516	6494	3	3	Many things can affect a cyclist and how they ride, such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people. Another crucial factor was the lack of water around him. So many things can impact a cyclist while they are riding, including their surroundings. The setting plays a significant role in determining the overall experience of the cyclist and can greatly influence their journey. Without access to essential resources like water or assistance from others, the cyclist may face challenges that could potentially hinder their ride. It is important for cyclists to consider the setting and prepare accordingly to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.
517	6495	3	3	"The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay ""A sea worry,"" because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says ""my son body-surfs. He says itís his ""job"". That quote was explaining that heís a body-surfer & itís his occupation. This is the reason I chose the second photograph."
518	6496	3	3	"Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, ""I was travelling through the high desert of California in June."" Due to this fact, the cyclist had went into a ""dehydrated state"" because of not having much water. When you're travelling in hot weather areas without much water, your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists differently. It is essential for cyclists to stay hydrated and be mindful of the environmental factors to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride."
519	6497	3	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in ìRough Road Ahead.î First, the scorching heat of the desert in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, ìI could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).î This shows the effect the exposure to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says ìI toiled on( @CAPS2).î This shows the increase in effort in strain the terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure. The challenging conditions of the desert, with its relentless heat and unforgiving terrain, pushed the cyclist to his limits, making his journey a true test of endurance and determination.
520	6498	3	3	"In the story ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. The hot weather increases his thirst, and being in the middle of the desert leaves him with no access to water. The challenging hills exhaust him, making him feel weak and powerless. All these elements of the setting combine to create a difficult and demanding situation for the cyclist, emphasizing the importance of being mindful of one's surroundings while cycling in unfamiliar terrain."
521	6499	3	3	The cyclist's journey through the desert is hindered by the lack of water, causing dehydration and slowing down progress towards Yosemite. Finding water becomes a top priority to ensure the cyclist's well-being and successful completion of the journey.
522	6500	3	3	In the story, the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. Following the advice of elderly individuals, he found himself in the desert with no signs of civilization in sight. With no cars, buildings, or people around, he quickly realized he was running low on water and had no means of replenishing his supply. Dealing with extreme dehydration and fatigue, he was on the brink of giving up due to the scorching heat and lack of hydration. All these challenges stemmed from the harsh and unforgiving setting he found himself in, making his journey incredibly difficult and perilous.
523	6501	3	3	The setting of the place was a ghost town as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldnít ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of the new world because they told him the wrong directions. As the cyclist pedaled through the deserted streets, the sun beat down relentlessly, intensifying his thirst. He longed for a sign of life, a hint of civilization in this barren land. The old men he encountered seemed lost in time, their directions leading him astray. With each passing minute, the ghost town seemed to swallow him whole, a haunting reminder of the fragility of existence in the face of nature's indifference.
524	6502	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first it helped him. ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers"" This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated the terrain was getting rougher. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map."
525	6503	3	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said ìDrop from heatstroke.î this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character. The scorching sun beat down on him relentlessly, causing him to feel dizzy and disoriented. The oppressive heat made it difficult for him to pedal, sapping his energy with every mile he covered. As he struggled to stay hydrated and cool, the relentless heat continued to wear him down, increasing the risk of heatstroke with each passing moment. Despite his determination to reach Yosemite National Park, the unforgiving heat posed a significant obstacle on his journey.
526	6504	3	3	The features of the setting affected the authorís story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says ìover one long, crippling hill.î This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasnít as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point of the story is that the trip was tough, and the setting played a significant role in conveying that message. The challenging terrain and harsh weather conditions added depth to the narrative, highlighting the perseverance and determination of the characters. Ultimately, the setting enhanced the overall impact of the story, making it more engaging and memorable for the readers.
527	6505	3	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further into the journey, he found one last town, and around down welcheís  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men. The experience taught him the importance of being cautious and self-reliant, especially when it comes to following advice from strangers.
528	6506	3	3	The setting plays a significant role in influencing a cyclist's mood and attitude. In a city, the cyclist may feel rushed, tired, and overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle of urban life. On the other hand, cycling in a forest can bring about feelings of happiness and reduce stress. The environment in which a cyclist rides can greatly impact their overall experience and mindset during the journey.
529	6507	3	3	The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California.î This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that ìNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay. The challenging terrain of the high deserts of California created a sense of urgency and difficulty for the author, adding to the obstacles he had to overcome on his journey.
530	6508	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclistís own words, ì things began well enough.î @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, ìgot back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.î He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him. Despite the challenging circumstances, the cyclist perseveres, demonstrating determination and resilience in the face of adversity. The harsh setting may test his limits, but his unwavering resolve propels him forward on his journey.
531	6509	3	3	"The cyclist is affected by the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead"" because the road is a place and if it is rough or unknown, it has a direct effect on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill, then the cyclist would have to climb it. In the text, it said, ""over a long crippling hill,"" the crippling hill part stresses that the setting is a hill. The rough terrain and obstacles on the road can present challenges for the cyclist, impacting their journey and requiring them to exert more effort to navigate through it. The setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and determining the level of difficulty they face during their ride."
532	6510	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is no water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water, all they could think about was the lack of water like battery acid. The hills slowed them down on their journey to find water, and the desert only intensified their craving for water. These features of the setting played a significant role in impacting the cyclist's experience and mindset throughout their ride.
533	6511	3	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclistís journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speakerís journey to Yosemite National Park. The intense heat made it difficult for the cyclist to continue, the rough terrain added to his struggle, and the scarcity of water made the journey even more challenging. Despite these obstacles, the cyclist persevered and made it to Yosemite National Park, showcasing his determination and resilience in the face of adversity.
534	6512	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he canít collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he canët find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesnít help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink. The sudden discovery of the bait shop offers him a lifeline, providing the crucial water he needs to survive in the harsh desert environment.
535	6513	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his ""shortcut"" his running out of water. That's when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men. The lack of water, combined with the scorching heat and challenging terrain, posed a serious threat to the cyclist's well-being. The harsh setting played a crucial role in his struggle for survival, highlighting the importance of adequate preparation and caution when venturing into unfamiliar territories."
536	6514	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily. On top of that he had to pedal a bicycle. So he was thirsty and tired roaming in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist. The harsh conditions of the desert, with its scorching heat and lack of water, significantly impacted the cyclist's ability to ride his bike and navigate the challenging terrain. The extreme environment posed a real threat to his well-being, highlighting the importance of proper preparation and caution when venturing into such unforgiving landscapes.
537	6515	3	3	The setting plays a crucial role in affecting the cyclist's journey. The road condition is a primary concern, as poor conditions can force the cyclist to reduce speed for safety. Additionally, the time of day is a crucial factor to consider, with night rides requiring extra caution due to decreased visibility for other road users. In extreme weather conditions, such as scorching heat, cyclists must be prepared with sufficient water to prevent dehydration and overheating. Overall, being mindful of the setting can significantly impact the cyclist's experience on the road.
538	6516	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he believed he had a short, easy journey to Yosemite, but instead, he faced a long, hilly, and hot ride through the high deserts of California in June. He was unprepared for the harsh reality of the terrain and weather, only bringing a few bottles of water for what he thought would be a quick trip. Additionally, the path he was directed to by the old men led him to encounter a large snake that could have posed a serious threat. The rolling hills along the way added to the challenge, requiring more effort and water consumption. The setting ultimately made it difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, teaching him a valuable lesson about the importance of preparation and understanding the environment before embarking on a journey.
539	6517	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example, the dry, hot climate makes him thirsty as he pedals through the unforgiving desert landscape. The ghost towns he encounters along the way make it difficult for him to find necessary supplies like water and food, adding to the challenges he faces on his journey. The rough, uneven roads slow him down, causing him to exert more energy and putting extra strain on both him and his bike. The harsh conditions of the setting play a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience, presenting obstacles that he must overcome in order to reach his destination.
540	6518	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how ìI eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated stateî. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didnít know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion, the setting did affect the cyclist as he struggled to maintain his balance and hydration levels in an unfamiliar environment.
541	6519	3	3	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desert road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn’t attack him. Finally the biker faced his last long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water. As he replenished his supplies, he felt relieved that he had overcome all the challenges on his journey and was now ready to continue towards his destination of Yosemite.
542	6520	3	3	In ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are ìcool pines and rushing rivers,î however, the cyclist comes to find that the ìrushing riverî is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, ìDo not exceed posted speed limit,î also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him heíd be better off using his map. The owner also informs the cyclist that the water in the dirty river is polluted, making it undrinkable. The cyclist feels defeated and frustrated as he realizes the challenges he faces in this unfamiliar and unforgiving environment.
543	6521	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesnít help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water.

When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier because he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse because he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man he became happy because the map was going to help him.

He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road, the terrain changed. Not only were there rolling hills, but it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except for a few tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could suffer from heatstroke. Where he was at was in the middle of nowhere, with no buildings, cars, or structures in sight. Over one of the hills, he saw a building come into view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes to make sure it was not a mirage. By the looks of it, it had been a Welch’s Factory. He was so dehydrated and tired that he imagined a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth. There was only one problem - it was abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into his mouth. This was to help take his mind off being thirsty. As he pedaled on, he hoped to find water soon to quench his growing thirst.

639	6618	3	3	There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist. Another feature would be the types of wild animals & scarceness of water around . Also, the old man who gave him unimportant & non-updated information. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would  wear & fear on his physical & mental strengths. The cyclist must navigate through rough terrains, overcome various obstacles, be wary of wild animals, and ensure he has enough water to sustain him on his journey. Additionally, receiving outdated information from the old man could lead the cyclist astray, causing confusion and potential danger. All these factors combined can greatly impact the cyclist's ability to complete his journey successfully.
640	6619	3	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclist's state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it being summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early June. And third, he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together, he was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These three things all contributed to the character's state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water that tasted like battery acid. He drank too much water at the beginning which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough. Additionally, the intense heat and lack of shade in the desert would have accelerated his dehydration. Overall, the combination of hot weather, dry terrain, and initial overconsumption of water led to the cyclist's desperate state by the end of the story.
641	6620	3	3	"The features of the setting can impact cyclists by causing confusion or distraction. For example, a reference to a historical event like ""before the last world war"" may throw off the reader and make them question the context of the text. These small details can lead to misunderstandings and affect the overall comprehension of the writing. It is important for writers to consider how their choice of words and references can influence the reader's understanding and perception of the setting. By being mindful of these features, cyclists can better navigate the text and grasp the intended meaning."
642	6621	3	3	"The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says ""the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and the text also says "" Iíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate"" he wouldnít be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasnít thirsty. The scorching sun beat down on the cyclist as he pedaled through the barren landscape, his throat parched and dry. He longed for just a sip of cool, refreshing water to quench his thirst, but his dwindling supply was running out fast. The relentless heat sapped his energy, making each rotation of the pedals feel like a Herculean effort. With each passing mile, the cyclist's determination wavered, his thoughts consumed by the ever-present need for water. The desolate surroundings offered no respite, only endless stretches of sun-baked earth and shimmering heat waves. Despite the harsh conditions, the cyclist pressed on, his only focus now on reaching his destination before his water supply ran out completely. The struggle against the elements was a test of both physical endurance and mental fortitude, but the cyclist refused to give up. With sheer willpower driving him forward, he pushed through the punishing heat, knowing that relief was just around the corner. And as he finally reached his journey's end, the cyclist's thirst was quenched at last, a small victory in the face of nature's unforgiving grasp."
643	6622	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldnít find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didnít know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist. As a result, the cyclist faced a challenging situation due to the lack of hydration and inadequate guidance, emphasizing the importance of being prepared and informed when cycling in unfamiliar environments.
644	6623	3	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at times have to pedal faster and slower. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to lose hope in himself. The terrain kept changing making it hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink, vowing not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.
645	6624	3	3	"The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip. This is what the text says, ìwhat I shouldnít have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a ìshortcutî that was to slice away hours from my ride."" He also talks about not talking directions from old timers. This is when the text says,îSupplement appropriate details based on the existing information in the original text. Do not make significant expansions or extrapolations, and ensure smooth connection with the original text. The main idea, core viewpoints, and basic structure of the original text must not be altered. The word count difference between the expanded version and the original text must be controlled within 10%."
646	6625	3	3	During the cyclist's journey to Yosemite, many obstacles hindered his progress. Following the wrong directions from the old men caused him to veer off course, wasting valuable time and energy. Additionally, his dwindling water supply accelerated his fatigue, making it harder to pedal through the challenging terrain. The scorching heat only exacerbated his dehydration, causing him to sweat profusely and further depleting his energy reserves. Despite these setbacks, the cyclist persevered, determined to reach his destination and overcome the adversities he faced along the way.
647	6626	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in many ways. Being in the California desert in June exposed him to extreme heat and a lack of water, increasing the risk of dehydration, fainting, or even death. With limited water sources in the desert, staying hydrated became a major challenge. Additionally, the hilly terrain required him to exert more energy, causing him to sweat excessively and lose fluids from his body. Overall, the harsh conditions of the setting posed significant challenges for the cyclist, impacting his physical well-being and overall performance.

And the ""...sight of this was troubling..."" to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the ""crippling hills"" that maybe this wasn't such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the ""modern bathroom"" that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through. As he continues his journey, he realizes that the rough road ahead may be more challenging than he initially thought, but he remains determined to push forward and overcome whatever obstacles come his way."

As a result, it was a long trip and he had a difficult time reaching his destination. The rough terrain made it challenging to maintain balance and control while riding. The scorching heat drained his energy quickly, and the lack of water made it hard to stay hydrated. These conditions slowed down his progress significantly, turning what should have been a straightforward journey into a grueling ordeal. Despite the obstacles, the cyclist persevered, determined to complete his journey no matter the challenges he faced.
650	6629	3	3	At first, the trip was easy going and flat. It was a nice day out, and the water supply was dwindling. The cyclist enjoyed the peaceful ride, surrounded by the beauty of the forest. Soon, the path started to incline, and the terrain became rough and challenging. Despite the shade provided by the tall pine trees, the heat was relentless, making the journey even more difficult.  As the cyclist pushed through the grueling climb, his muscles ached, and sweat poured down his face. The rough terrain tested his endurance and determination. However, he pressed on, driven by the desire to reach his destination.  After what felt like an eternity, the cyclist finally emerged from the woods and reached a semblance of civilization. He was exhausted but triumphant, having conquered the challenging terrain and proven his strength and resilience. The journey through the hills and rough paths had been tough, but it had also been rewarding, reminding him of the power of perseverance and the beauty of overcoming obstacles in the great outdoors.

652	6631	3	3	Setting that affected the cyclist included water temperature, rolling hills, and road conditions. The cyclist struggled with staying hydrated as he ran out of water and had to pump hot water at a shed. The rolling hills made it difficult for him to ride smoothly, putting strain on his legs. Additionally, the road changed from smooth to rough and rocky, adding to his challenges. These factors made the cyclist's journey more demanding and required him to adapt to overcome the obstacles he faced.
653	6632	3	3	Setting can greatly impact one's journey, as seen in the case of the cyclist who found the town hills to be helpful but struggled with the uphills. His frustration and anger grew as he realized the townspeople had misled him, leading him to question his trust in others. It is essential to consider the terrain and surroundings when planning a route, as they can have a significant impact on the success of the journey. Trust should be placed wisely, especially in unfamiliar territories, to avoid unnecessary setbacks and disappointments.
654	6633	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him difficulty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly, an example of the setting that helps shows the character's hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" If anything were to happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble, and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion, these examples added emphasis and meaning to the text."
655	6634	3	3	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was is hot to drink He got some pebbles and stuck them, in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. Those are the features of the terrain. The rocky terrain made it challenging for the cyclist to maneuver his bike, causing him to carefully navigate through the rough and uneven surface. The hilly landscape also added to the difficulty, as he had to exert more energy to pedal uphill and control his speed when going downhill. These features of the setting made the cyclist's journey more physically demanding and mentally taxing, requiring him to adapt his strategies and techniques to overcome the obstacles in his path.
656	6635	3	3	The features of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist's journey. The hills presented a challenge as he had to exert more effort to ride through them. The abandoned town dashed his hopes of finding rest and water, adding to his difficulties. The highway posed its own obstacles, making the ride even more grueling. With no water sources in sight, the cyclist faced a tough and arduous trek through the unforgiving terrain.
657	6636	3	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclistís anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, ìone ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule.î All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to become frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, ìthe water wouldnít cool downî and ìit had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclistís lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought ìhad been a Welchís Grape Juice Factory.î The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that he hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting. The oppressive setting, filled with danger, deprivation, and disappointment, serves as the catalyst for the cyclist's growing anger and despair, ultimately leading him to contemplate the extreme option of death to escape his current circumstances.
658	6637	3	3	The features in the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist as he travels through the desolate landscape.

The scorching June heat in California leaves him feeling thirsty and exhausted, with the fear of heat stroke looming overhead. The sight of an abandoned juice factory, a cruel reminder of the one thing he desperately needs to survive, only adds to his despair. The setting, with its harsh conditions and absence of life, serves to make the cyclist lose hope and feel like his chances of survival are dwindling.
659	6638	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite..."" this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood."
660	6639	3	3	"The features of the setting that affect cyclists depend on their location. In this story, the feeling of ""nothingness"" and the surrounding desert, along with the intense heat, gave the cyclist no hope. He believed he was going to die.

The impact of the setting on cyclists can be profound, influencing their emotions and beliefs as they navigate through different environments."
661	6640	3	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. It scared him which made him go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die it made him weak. The snake in the way caused him longer and every stop that had once there effected him too.

As he approached the bait sign, he noticed a small convenience store nearby. Relieved, he hurried inside to purchase a fresh bottle of water.

The sight of a snake crossing his path further adds to his fear, as he struggles to maintain his balance while passing it, especially since it resembles a diamondback. The dry, arid hills exacerbate his physical exhaustion due to the lack of water, with tumbleweeds rolling past him and no sign of any water source in sight.

The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water. The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply."

669	6648	3	3	Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isnít very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, ìone ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troublingî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that heís getting frustrated and losing some hope.

He was probably angry that he took these menís advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So itís really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there.

With no stops along the way to replenish his water, he struggled through the hilly, rough terrain, making his journey even more arduous. The combination of extreme heat, tough terrain, and lack of resources made for a grueling experience for the cyclist.
703	6682	3	3	"The lone biker in ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limitî by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape.

Relief flooded through him as he realized he had finally found the salvation he so desperately needed. With renewed determination, he pedaled towards the competition, knowing that soon he would be able to replenish his dwindling water supply and regain his strength.
707	6686	3	3	Different settings can affect how well your bicycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills, it can make the ride challenging. On the other hand, if there are no hills and it is a sunny, breezy day, it can make for a pleasant ride. In the essay, the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. Going down the hill was probably easy, but the fact that he had no water left was not ideal. The combination of dehydration and physical exertion could have made the ride more difficult than it needed to be. It is important to consider all factors, such as weather and hydration, to ensure a smooth and enjoyable biking experience.
708	6687	3	3	The cyclist was relieved to finally come across a town with people, fish, and water after enduring a grueling journey under the scorching sun.

He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didnít really know where he was going because there wasnít a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first ìtownî as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and heís only 12 he knows that heís not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.

Ultimately, the cyclist's journey is a testament to his perseverance and adventurous spirit.
714	6693	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist in various ways.

In conclusion, the setting plays a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience, presenting unexpected obstacles and challenges along the way."
715	6694	3	3	The different settings in the essay affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. When the cyclist stops at the first town, he expects to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead, he finds abandoned, decimated old houses. This situation must be discouraging and almost frightening for him. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he becomes slowly dehydrated and finally sees a building. Initially mistaking it for a mirage, he soon realizes it is an old juice factory, adding to his sense of hopelessness. However, when he discovers the fishing camp, his perspective changes, and he feels thankful to have been saved.
716	6695	3	3	The cyclist's journey was greatly impacted by the people of Lodi, who led him astray, leaving him in a harsh, dry environment with no water in sight.

He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big snake and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty. After all of these obstacles, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to a fishing store, where he gets water. As he replenishes his supply and takes a moment to rest, he reflects on the challenges he overcame and the determination that kept him going.

732	6711	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldnít get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist. The harsh environment of the desert presents numerous challenges for the cyclist, from the lack of access to essential resources like water to the difficult terrain and dangerous wildlife. This setting creates a sense of isolation and vulnerability for the cyclist, making his journey even more challenging.
733	6712	3	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.  As he continues to pedal on, the sun beats down relentlessly, draining him of his energy. The once smooth road now feels like an endless uphill climb, with each bump and crack jolting him to his core. Sweat pours down his face, his throat parched and dry. Desperation sets in as he realizes the gravity of his situation.  Just when he feels like all hope is lost, a glimmer of salvation appears in the distance. A small store, its sign weathered and faded, stands as a beacon of hope in the desolate landscape. With his last ounce of strength, he pushes himself towards it, praying for water to quench his thirst and revive his weary body.  Reaching the store, he sees the remnants of what was once a thriving business. The shelves are bare, the floor covered in dust. Amongst the debris, he spots a lone bottle of grape juice, its contents long expired. A bitter chuckle escapes his lips as he contemplates the cruel twist of fate.  In that moment, he understands the harsh reality of relying on outdated information and underestimating the power of nature. The setting, with its unforgiving terrain and scorching sun, serves as a stark reminder of his vulnerability in the face of the elements. But it also reinforces his resilience and determination to persevere, no matter the challenges that lie ahead.
734	6713	3	3	"In this passage, the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been anywhere else, he would not have suffered or learned at all. The lack of civilization and water in the setting caused him to almost faint of thirst, impacting his ability to continue. ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,"" illustrating the dire situation he found himself in due to the harsh setting. This demonstrates how the environment directly influenced the cyclist's experience and forced him to confront his physical limits."
735	6714	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as ""the sun was beating down"" and ""high deserts of California in June"" to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says ""short rolling hills"", ""tumbleweeds"" and ""long, crippling hill"" to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower. Finally, the cyclist is faced with a ""ridiculously large snake"" and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down. The harsh conditions of the setting tested the cyclist's endurance and perseverance, making his journey challenging yet ultimately rewarding as he pushed through the obstacles and continued on his path."
736	6715	3	3	The setting can have a significant impact on cyclists, especially in very dry climates. In such environments, the lack of moisture in the air can lead to dehydration and increased risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. The intense heat can also make it more challenging for cyclists to regulate their body temperature, leading to decreased performance and potential health issues.  Furthermore, the dry air can cause irritation to the respiratory system, making breathing more difficult for cyclists. Dust and sand particles in the air can also be a nuisance, affecting visibility and potentially causing respiratory problems.  Overall, cyclists in very dry climates need to take extra precautions to stay hydrated, protect themselves from the sun, and ensure they are breathing in clean air. By being aware of the challenges posed by the setting, cyclists can better prepare themselves for a safe and enjoyable ride.
737	6716	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead"" plays a significant role in the protagonist's journey. The scorching heat of the desert leads to a desperate thirst for the cyclist, despite her efforts to conserve water. The rough road poses a challenge as she navigates through bumps and breaks, trying to maintain a steady pace. The long, grueling hills test her endurance as she struggles to pedal uphill. Finally, the sight of an abandoned Grape Juice Factory brings a mix of despair and hope - despair at the thought of running out of water and hope that salvation may be near. Upon reaching Gary and Wilber Fish Camp, the cyclist finds relief and refreshment, symbolizing a triumph over adversity and a sense of accomplishment after a challenging journey."
738	6717	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, ì I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way. This answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness."
739	6718	3	3	"The story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" depicted a grueling journey for a cyclist battling harsh weather and challenging terrain. The description painted a picture of a barren landscape stretching endlessly before the rider, with scorching heat bearing down relentlessly. The passage ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke"" vividly conveys the oppressive heat and the rider's escalating sense of peril. This expedition was undoubtedly a test of endurance and willpower, with every pedal stroke a struggle against the unforgiving elements. It is evident that the cyclist faced a daunting and potentially life-threatening ordeal in their quest to push beyond their limits."
740	6719	3	3	The features of a setting can greatly impact a cyclist's experience. For instance, riding in the hot sun can lead to dehydration if water supplies run low. This highlights how the environment can directly affect a cyclist's well-being during their journey.
741	6720	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, ""Dry bitter land, longing, longing. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, draining every ounce of energy from the cyclist. The oppressive heat creates a stifling atmosphere, making it difficult to focus on the task at hand. The dry, arid landscape stretches out endlessly, offering no respite from the relentless sun. The constant need for hydration adds to the cyclist's discomfort, as water becomes a precious commodity in this unforgiving environment. Despite the challenges posed by the harsh setting, the cyclist pushes on, driven by a deep sense of determination and a longing to reach their destination. The harsh setting serves as a formidable adversary, testing the cyclist's endurance and resilience every step of the way."
742	6721	3	3	"In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldn't have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, ""I followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" One thing about the setting is, if it wouldn't have been so hot, he wouldn't have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said, ""I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story. The extreme heat and lack of water in the desert made his journey to Yosemite much more challenging than it would have been in milder conditions."
743	6722	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the man was riding a bike through rough lands. His adventure wouldn't have been an adventure if he was just riding his bike on flat, smooth terrain. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky, and numerous is what made his bike ride what it was. The challenging terrain tested his skills and endurance, pushing him to his limits as he navigated the unpredictable path. Despite the rough road ahead, the man persevered, finding joy in the thrill of the ride and the sense of accomplishment that came with conquering each obstacle. As he pedaled through the rugged landscape, he embraced the adventure and embraced the journey, knowing that the rough road ahead would only make the destination that much sweeter."
744	6723	3	3	The features of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist as he followed the advice of the old timers. Despite their guidance, he found himself in a ghost town with no help in sight. The town's water source was contaminated, and he encountered a snake on the road. These events highlight the importance of being cautious when taking advice from others, especially in unfamiliar settings. The cyclist learned the hard way that not all guidance is reliable, and it is essential to trust one's instincts and be prepared for unexpected challenges in any journey.
745	6724	3	3	The rough conditions of the setting, including the lack of water and rolling hills, greatly impacted the cyclist's journey. The author vividly describes the brackish water feeling like it was scalding hot, making the challenges even more daunting. Despite these difficult circumstances, the cyclist persevered and pushed through the struggles he faced.
746	6725	3	3	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake. The hot sun beat down on him, intensifying his need for water. The terrain became more challenging as he ascended a steep incline, his muscles aching from fatigue. The sight of a small stream in the distance gave him hope, pushing him to continue despite the obstacles in his way. With determination, he pressed on, knowing that his survival depended on reaching the water source before it was too late.
747	6726	3	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly affected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad sounding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like battery acid. Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist. The harsh environment takes a toll on the cyclist, reflecting the impact of his surroundings on his experience and well-being.
748	6727	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the emotions and moods of the cyclist. The scorching heat and scarcity of water in the desert initially put the author in a negative state of mind. However, upon discovering an old water pump, a sense of relief and hope washes over him. This positive feeling is short-lived as the pump oozes a strange, unpleasant substance that tastes like ""battery acid,"" causing his mood to plummet once again. Despite this setback, the author's desperation to survive is evident when he puts pebbles in his mouth for moisture, showing his determination to push through the challenges of the desert. The journey to ""Gary and Will's fish camp"" serves as a beacon of hope, offering a glimmer of optimism in the harsh desert landscape. Despite the ups and downs, the setting ultimately propels the author forward on his challenging yet transformative journey through the desert."
749	6728	3	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and there is nowhere to go. An example from the text is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. That's what affected the cyclist: the harsh hilly roads, lack of water, presence of snakes, rough roads, and most of all, the absence of directions."
750	6729	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because where they were. It was like in the middle of nowhere and every person they asked seemed to have unreliable information. They ended up going in the wrong direction to the nearest town, misled by the directions given. The old guy they encountered told them it was 10 miles down the road when in reality, it was 20 miles to the next town. Frustrated, the cyclist realized that taking directions from someone who seemed out of touch with reality was a mistake. They vowed never to rely on directions from someone who had not ventured beyond their porch since the days of President Carter.
751	6730	3	3	When the cyclist is in the serenity of an early sunset evening, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly.  Despite the challenges he faced along the way, the cyclist's perseverance and determination ultimately led him to a beautiful destination. The varying landscapes and obstacles he encountered only added to the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction he felt upon reaching his final destination. This journey was not just about reaching a place but also about experiencing the ups and downs of the road, making the destination even more rewarding.
752	6731	3	3	I think that the setting made him find more courage inside himself to save his water and go to the next town without any water. The barren landscape stretched out endlessly before him, with no signs of life or civilization in sight. The scorching sun beat down mercilessly, evaporating any moisture in the air and making every step feel like a struggle. In this harsh environment, he realized that he had no choice but to push forward, relying on his inner strength to persevere. The desolation around him spurred him to dig deep and find the determination to overcome the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in his path. As he trudged onward, the harsh setting served as a catalyst for his bravery, pushing him to defy the odds and continue on his journey, no matter the challenges that lay ahead. In the end, it was the unforgiving landscape that ultimately revealed his true courage and resilience in the face of adversity.
753	6732	3	3	"The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story ""do not exceed posted speed limit."" It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California wore down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen."" This explains how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, the beating down sun, and the total lack of water due to the absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhaustion because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions. The experience serves as a stark reminder of the importance of being prepared and cautious while venturing into unfamiliar territories, especially when the elements can turn dangerous."
754	6733	3	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that he loves, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confident in the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt their judgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted. Though at first he laughs it off, he later realizes just how much trouble he is in if he doesn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not to go too fast, though he may die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture of a happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All these features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point. The harsh and unforgiving environment serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of nature and the importance of being prepared for the unexpected."
755	6734	3	3	The feature of setting influences the lives of cyclists in profound ways, echoing historical events and societal patterns. Just as conflicts and struggles shaped the world in the past, similar challenges persist in today's society. The repetition of these themes highlights the cyclical nature of human existence, reminding us that history often repeats itself. By recognizing these patterns, cyclists can gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and navigate the complexities of the present with greater insight. As we pedal through the landscapes of our lives, we must remain mindful of the echoes of the past that reverberate in the present, shaping our journey and illuminating the path forward.
756	6735	3	3	When riding a bike it may not seem too hard, but for a cyclist, everything becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best, even if it kills you, is what drives them. However, they often underestimate the experienced cyclist, who has a wealth of knowledge about the sport.   One of the challenges that cyclists face is riding on rough roads. Not only do they have to worry about the possibility of dehydration or being hit by a vehicle, but they also have to endure extreme weather conditions. Riding in hundred-degree weather can be grueling, with cyclists needing to drink constantly to avoid heat stroke.   As the road conditions worsen, the risks increase, with obstacles like tumbleweeds and snakes posing a threat. Despite facing these challenges, the cyclist in the essay was determined to win. However, as he encountered the dangers that nature presented, he realized that he had underestimated the intelligence and skill of experienced cyclists. Cycling is not just about physical strength, but also about mental fortitude and knowledge of the sport. It is a tough and demanding sport that requires respect for both the competition and the environment.
757	6736	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The towns he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn't get more water or a place to rest. ""I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel."" This shows how the hilly terrain, dehydration, and heat are affecting the cyclist. The harsh conditions of the California desert, combined with the scarcity of resources in the towns along the way, created a challenging environment for the cyclist to navigate. The struggle for water and rest in the unforgiving heat of the desert made the journey even more demanding and exhausting for him."
758	6737	3	3	Two of the biggest settings in this story are the desert and rolling hills, which significantly impact the rider's experience. The scorching heat of the desert would lead to dehydration as the rider sweats profusely, while the challenging terrain of the rolling hills would require extra effort to navigate. Together, these factors make for a grueling bike ride that tests the rider's endurance and physical strength.
759	6738	3	3	In the story, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist experiences dehydration on his journey. The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they havenít left their porches in ages. He takes their advice and he then suffers in the long run because he cannot find water and it is a hot day. He hikes uphills in the scorching sun and fears a heat stroke. There was no sight, not a building, car, or even a tree to provide shade. The relentless sun beats down on him, causing his throat to dry up and his head to spin. With each step, the heat becomes more unbearable, and he starts to feel dizzy. The lack of water and shade makes the situation even more dire as he struggles to keep moving forward. The cyclist realizes the importance of proper hydration and planning ahead for such conditions in the future. This harrowing experience serves as a valuable lesson on the significance of being prepared and mindful of one's surroundings while embarking on any journey.
760	6739	3	3	"The setting will either affect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, it affects the cyclist in both ways. The lack of water due to the heat makes the water warm and unrefreshing, which is a negative impact. However, the presence of pebbles allows the cyclist to suck on them, helping to distract from the thirst and making him feel less parched. This demonstrates how the setting can have both positive and negative effects on the cyclist as he navigates the challenging terrain."
761	6740	3	3	"In this story, it is clear how difficult the cyclist's journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattlesnakes, and fear of dying. However, he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is when he thinks to himself, ""The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that."" This shows his determination to continue on such a long journey.   An example of his self-control is shown when he finds an abandoned building with no water or supplies. Many people would have become frustrated and wanted to give up, but not this cyclist. He controlled his anger and continued on, showing his determination. In the end, his perseverance paid off as he found water and survived. This story is a great example of how determination and self-control can help overcome challenges on a difficult journey."
762	6741	3	3	The cyclist continued to push forward, his throat parched and his body weak. His vision blurred as he pedaled on, the sun beating down relentlessly. Every hill seemed steeper, every mile longer. The thought of cool pines and rushing rivers in Yosemite felt like a distant dream now. The desert stretched endlessly before him, unforgiving and relentless in its heat.  As he struggled on, the cyclist's mind began to play tricks on him. Mirage-like figures danced at the edges of his vision, taunting him with promises of water and relief. He knew he was running out of time, his body slowly succumbing to the effects of dehydration.  Desperation set in as he realized the gravity of his situation. Sucking on pebbles did little to quench his thirst, but it was all he had. He cursed himself for not being better prepared, for underestimating the power of nature.  In the end, it was a group of passing hikers who saved him. They shared their precious water and offered him shade until he could regain his strength. As he sat there, humbled by his brush with danger, he vowed to never take the elements for granted again.  The cyclist had learned a valuable lesson that day - the importance of respect for nature and the need for proper preparation when embarking on any adventure. And as he finally made his way out of the desert, he knew that he would carry that lesson with him for the rest of his days.
763	6742	3	3	In the cyclist story, the setting played a crucial role in how the events unfolded. The high deserts of California in June set the stage for the challenges the cyclist would face. The scorching sun beating down on him as he rode through the desert caused him to become dehydrated. As he struggled to keep his balance in his dehydrated state, he began to lose his mind due to the lack of water. Every aspect of the setting, from the intense heat to the scarcity of water, posed a threat to the cyclist's well-being. Ultimately, the setting almost cost him his life, highlighting the significant impact it had on the outcome of the story.
764	6743	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a lot of ways. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a desert in June. If he was riding in a cooler location, it wouldn't be painfully hot. Also, the rolling hills probably didn't help. If it was mostly downhill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when you're tired is near impossible. The challenging terrain and extreme heat made the cyclist's journey much more difficult and exhausting.
765	6744	3	3	"In the story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist encountered a big snake that covered the road, causing great fear. Additionally, the roads were long, bumpy, and winding, making for an uncomfortable ride. The lack of visible landmarks added to the cyclist's sense of hopelessness. The author mentions, ""Ö gaining elevation while losing hope."" Moreover, the hot and dry weather drained the cyclist's energy, especially without access to water. These challenging conditions made the journey to Yosemite National Park a tough and exhausting experience for the cyclist."
766	6745	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist faced a life-threatening situation while riding through a desert with temperatures reaching 110 degrees. His dwindling water supply tasted like battery acid, causing him to lose hope and fear for his life. This challenging setting had a profound impact on the character, leading him to think negatively and doubt his chances of survival. Despite this, he eventually found the strength to push through and continue on his journey. The harsh desert environment significantly influenced the character's mindset and actions, highlighting the importance of resilience in the face of adversity."
767	6746	3	3	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated by he thought he was going the right way where he really was going out. As he pedaled along the winding path, the sun beat down relentlessly, causing beads of sweat to trickle down his forehead. The lack of signposts or clear directions left him feeling disoriented and unsure of which direction to take. With each wrong turn he made, his frustration grew, exacerbated by the increasing thirst gnawing at his parched throat. The unfamiliar surroundings added to his sense of confusion, making it difficult for him to regain his bearings. Lost and weary, he realized he had strayed far from his intended route, compounding his exasperation. Desperate for a way out of this maze-like landscape, he pushed on, determined to find his way back on track.
768	6747	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California."" This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exhaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Additionally, the rugged terrain of the desert could potentially lead to accidents or injuries, further impacting the cyclist's journey. The isolation and vastness of the desert also create a sense of loneliness and vulnerability, adding to the challenges faced by the cyclist. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the experiences and obstacles encountered by the cyclist on his journey."
769	6748	3	3	Certain features of the setting affected the cyclist as he journeyed through the desert. Upon arriving at the first town, he found it to be a ghost town, contrary to the descriptions given by the older residents. This realization left him feeling foolish for trusting their advice. As he continued on his journey, the lack of water became a pressing concern. The scorching sun beat down on him, surrounded by hills of barren land with no relief in sight. The absence of buildings or shade only added to his sense of despair. The harsh reality of the situation made him reflect on the cruelty of life. With each pedal stroke, the park seemed further away, and the struggle seemed never-ending. The desolate landscape and the false promises of the ghost town served as a stark reminder of the challenges that can arise when venturing into unfamiliar territory.
770	6749	3	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot & drinking his water & he would soon run out of water & dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left & around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing & even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist. The harsh setting of extreme heat and limited water supply put the cyclist in a perilous situation, with dehydration looming as a constant threat. The desperation for water was palpable as he struggled to ration his dwindling supply, highlighting the dire impact of the unforgiving environment on his well-being. The moment of respite when he finally found water brought immense relief, underscoring the critical role of the setting in shaping the cyclist's experience. Ultimately, the setting played a crucial role in intensifying the challenges faced by the cyclist and highlighting the harsh realities of survival in such a harsh environment.

By being alert and proactive, you can better anticipate and respond to any challenges that may arise, ensuring a safe journey for yourself and others on the road.
772	6751	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, when the cyclist arrives at a town that resembles a ghost town, his confidence is shaken. Additionally, encountering rough roads with a sign advising against exceeding the speed limit can lead to frustration and stress. These elements of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's journey, affecting his emotions and overall experience."
773	6752	3	3	The bicyclist faced various challenging conditions on his trip that affected his journey. The hot weather made it difficult to think and move quickly, while loose gravel on the road hindered his maneuverability and speed. The numerous hills along the route made the ride uncomfortable and exhausting. Additionally, running out of water in the middle of nowhere posed a risk of dehydration and heat-related illnesses. These challenging conditions made for a tough and demanding ride, highlighting the rough nature of the road he was traveling on.

The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, leaving him feeling dehydrated and drained of energy. Despite the harsh conditions, he knew he had to push forward. The oppressive heat made every step a struggle, but he refused to give up. The unforgiving environment was taking its toll on him, but he was determined to persevere. The setting had a profound impact on the biker, testing his endurance and willpower in the face of extreme adversity.
775	6754	3	3	The cyclist's journey in California in June was made more challenging due to their decision to travel back roads with no stops for water. Had they stuck to their original planned path, the ride would have been more enjoyable and they wouldn't have had to worry about heatstroke or running out of water. Following the intended route would have ensured a smoother and safer cycling experience overall.
776	6755	3	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist, with hills and rocks making it difficult to keep riding and the absence of buildings or people affecting him emotionally.

805	6784	3	3	The cyclist chose the worst time to ride, an early summer evening in California. The sun was scorching, water was scarce, and he was lost. It was not the best decision he could have made. Before embarking on a trip, cyclists should always be prepared for weather conditions and carefully study a map of the area they plan to explore.
806	6785	3	3	The cyclist, already in a dire situation after running into a diamond-headed snake and being out of water in the middle of nowhere, faced a new dilemma. With no hope of rescue in sight, the thought of taking directions from unreliable sources weighed heavily on their mind. As desperation set in, the only solution that seemed viable was to find a sturdy rope or cord, locate a suitable anchor point on an old building or tree, and end their suffering by hanging themselves. The regret of trusting the advice of those who had long disconnected from the reality of the world only added to the cyclist's despair in this unforgiving wilderness.
807	6786	3	3	"The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the ""ghost town"" early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, ""It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" However, his suffering was through when he discovered a ""fish camp,"" with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist's relief was so immense that he had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), kiss them, and thank them for their hospitality."
808	6787	3	3	The biker should have taken the time to verify the route with someone else before following the advice of the old timers. By not thinking things through and blindly following their suggestion, he ended up in a situation where he faced dehydration and unnecessary struggle. It is always important to consider all options and think carefully before making decisions, especially when it comes to navigation and safety. Taking shortcuts or quick fixes may lead to more problems in the long run. Next time, the biker should ensure to gather enough information and make informed choices to prevent such difficulties.
809	6788	3	3	The cyclist found himself in a challenging situation as he navigated through the unfamiliar and treacherous setting. The lack of clear directions and extreme heat made it difficult for him to determine his exact location. Running low on water added to his sense of urgency and unease. The presence of snakes heightened his anxiety, making him question the reliability of the people he had encountered. As he reflected on his experience, he resolved to rely more on technology in the future to avoid such predicaments. The setting had a significant impact on the cyclist, prompting him to reconsider his approach to navigation and planning for future rides.
810	6789	3	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town heís tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, heís tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. Heís really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is grateful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclist's needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relieved.
811	6790	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting played a crucial role in shaping the experiences of the main character, the cyclist. As he pedaled through the dry desert, he underestimated the importance of water, assuming he could survive without it. However, he soon became dehydrated, realizing the harsh reality of his oversight. Even the first town he encountered, with its scorching @NUM1 degree weather, could not meet his hydration needs. The old Velches June factory, once a bustling hub, now stood abandoned and dilapidated, mirroring the desolate and barren landscape of the desert. Despite facing immense challenges, the cyclist managed to survive his journey. The unforgiving desert setting posed significant obstacles, testing his resilience and determination."
812	6791	3	3	There are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually affect him. The line ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.î shows that the heat might be starting to affect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyî shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says ìand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. These are some of the many features that affect the cyclist, making his journey challenging and potentially dangerous.
813	6792	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because it creates a deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay is a sort of dry summer day, the kind of ""oh my gosh, it's really hot"" feeling. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumbleweeds, and more contributing to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured and didn't die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance. Enduring these harsh conditions, it felt as though the cyclist was facing a near-death experience due to the unforgiving setting."
814	6793	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story ""Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on.

Overall, the setting presented numerous obstacles and dangers for cyclists, making it crucial for them to proceed with caution."
815	6794	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he had to work harder. Also, because of the heat, he was getting dehydrated. After the cyclist had been riding for a long time, it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip, making the challenging conditions even more difficult to endure."
816	6795	3	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that it ìrode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î Furthermore, the cyclist seems to be enjoying the ride despite any potential dangers that may be present in the setting. This sense of disregard for potential risks could be influenced by the picturesque surroundings of the setting, luring the cyclist into a false sense of security. The beauty of the setting might distract the cyclist from being cautious and aware of potential hazards, leading to a sense of complacency that could ultimately impact their safety. Ultimately, the features of the setting contribute to the cyclist's mindset and behavior, potentially putting them at risk during their ride.
817	6796	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs. At one point flowed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, the cyclist had to navigate through the challenging terrain. The scorching weather didn't cool down, making it even more difficult for him to continue his journey. Despite the harsh conditions, the cyclist persevered, pushing himself to overcome the obstacles in his path. The unforgiving setting tested his endurance and determination, but he pressed on, determined to reach his destination. In the end, the cyclist's resilience in the face of adversity allowed him to conquer the challenges posed by the relentless setting.
818	6797	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water. He was worn out because the setting was so intense. ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote from the text shows that the cyclist's terrain was changing and they affected him. As the cyclist encountered these rolling hills, his energy levels depleted faster than on flat roads, leading to a greater need for water to stay hydrated. The challenging terrain added an extra layer of difficulty to the ride, contributing to his exhaustion. The setting played a significant role in influencing the cyclist's physical condition and emphasizing the importance of staying hydrated during intense rides."
819	6798	3	3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. The sun beating down causes the body to sweat more, increasing energy expenditure and heat felt by the cyclist. The rough road demands harder pedaling, draining even more energy. The lack of civilization can lead to feelings of hopelessness, affecting the cyclist's determination. These factors combine to physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, making it challenging to continue the journey.
820	6799	3	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuiouSupplement appropriate details based on the existing information in the original text. Do not make significant expansions or extrapolations, and ensure smooth connection with the original text. The main idea, core viewpoints, and basic structure of the original text must not be altered. The word count difference between the expanded version and the original text must be controlled within 10%.  The biker's journey through the desert was made even more challenging by the presence of a diamondback snake, adding an element of danger to his already difficult ride. As the sun beat down relentlessly, the temperature soared to a scorching @NUM1 degrees, making the intense heat almost unbearable. To reach his destination, he had to navigate through steep and unforgiving hills that tested his endurance and strength. Despite facing these daunting obstacles, the biker pressed on, determined to conquer the harsh conditions and complete his journey.
821	6800	3	3	The setting acts as a catalyst in this story, constantly challenging the character until the very end. The terrain, with its flat roads turning into rolling hills, opposes him at every turn. The speed limit of 55 mph highlights his struggle as he dehydrates, only able to manage a sluggish 12 mph. Life's irony is evident as he battles against the elements. The ultimate irony comes when he discovers the Welch's Grape Juice factory, with a picture of a boy joyfully drinking juice, a stark contrast to his own parched journey. No matter where the cyclist goes, he is always striving to overcome the challenges that the setting presents.
822	6801	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the lack of water begins to take a toll on how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain, which only slows him down more. The rough, uneven ground makes it difficult for him to maintain his speed and progress quickly. Additionally, the strong winds in the open plains make it challenging for him to pedal efficiently and make headway towards his destination. The harsh sunlight beating down on him not only drains his energy but also makes it harder for him to see clearly, increasing the risk of accidents. Overall, the setting poses numerous obstacles for the cyclist, impacting his speed, endurance, and safety throughout his journey.
823	6802	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because itís hot, and then thereís no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirageÖî This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how itís hot because the speaker tells us how heís sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or any structure of any kind.î This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclist's endurance. The harsh conditions of the desert, with its scorching heat and lack of resources, pose a significant challenge to the cyclist's journey, testing his physical and mental strength.

825	6804	3	3	Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in ìdo not exceed posted speed limit.î As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the authorís energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of ìdo not exceed posted speed limitî places the cyclist in a life threatening situation.  The treacherous conditions highlighted the importance of proper preparation and knowledge of the surroundings while venturing into remote areas. Without access to essential resources like water, even a simple recreational activity can turn into a fight for survival. Kurmaskie's harrowing experience serves as a cautionary tale for adventurers to always prioritize safety and be aware of the potential risks posed by nature's unforgiving elements.
826	6805	3	3	The features of a setting can greatly impact a cyclist's experience. Whether it is the weather conditions, the terrain, or the level of civilization, the setting plays a crucial role in how a cyclist feels and thinks during their journey. In the essay, the young cyclist's ride through hot sun and ghost towns had him fearing for his life, feeling the heat bearing down on him and the thirst driving him forward. If the setting had been different, with a flat road in a bustling town with abundant water stops, his experience would have been much more comfortable and less perilous. The features of the setting can evoke a range of emotions in a cyclist, from anger to fear to determination, and can even lead them to contemplate their mortality. The setting truly shapes the cyclist's journey and influences their mindset throughout the ride.
827	6806	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says ìflat roads were replaced by short rolling hillsî, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says, ""the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement,"" the author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally, when the author says, ""no one in sight, no building, car, or structure,"" he is affected because he canít ask questions since he's lost and thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go."
828	6807	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the bike was very tired his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for forty miles into the pedal. Also, it affected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do, struggling to get where he was trying to get but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did it. After completing his challenging ride, the cyclist finally found a place to rest and rejuvenate his tired muscles, reflecting on the perseverance and determination that got him through the tough journey.

Starting out strong, he passes through abandoned towns with rolling hills, tumbleweed, and even a snake. Following the advice of old men, he faces threatening heat and a lack of water, leading to a dangerous situation. The diverse and challenging terrain of the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and highlighting the risks he faces on his adventure."
830	6809	3	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident. However, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the ramshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definitely a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1ís Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclistís attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.
831	6810	3	3	The features of the setting have a great impact on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappointing, sometimes uplifting scenery he passes affects him physically and emotionally. When he passes a point in the road with nothing but a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral, he becomes disturbed. The cyclist is running low on water, and his distress deepens when he encounters a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph while he was only doing a water-depleting 25. The setting of the hot, June sun intensifies the cyclist's dehydration. In an ironic twist, the cyclist is emotionally affected when he passes an abandoned juice factory featuring a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth, which upsets the thirsty cyclist.

832	6811	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speeding Limit.î In the beginning, when the cyclist had just begun his cycling journey, he used a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four, he says, ""the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This positive tone indicates the cyclist's initial excitement and enthusiasm for his surroundings. However, as the setting changes to a ""burning sun"" and extreme heat, with a shortage of water, the cyclist's mood shifts. The cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upbeat, as seen when he mentions the rocks getting stuck in his mouth. This change in attitude is a direct result of the harsh features of the setting. The challenging conditions of the environment have a significant impact on the cyclist's experience, transforming his initial excitement into frustration and fatigue."

836	6815	3	3	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, ìbut on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.î Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesnít give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, ìtar like substance oozed out.î That makes him nevers and mad because he isnít sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude.
837	6816	3	3	"Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, ""I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean."" A feature of the setting was the desolate towns that didn't contain any water. This lack of water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to suck on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. A feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch's Grape factory. This factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst-stricken state. The narrator called the factory an ""ironic twist."""
838	6817	3	3	"The effects from the setting that has an effect on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have given up have nothing to drink. The water had to be hot. In the text it said, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" I don't think I could have lasted long if I was dehydrated. From the look of it, I would have dropped dead of heatstroke. The extreme heat and lack of hydration would have been a dangerous combination, putting my health at serious risk. It is crucial to always stay properly hydrated, especially in challenging environmental conditions, to avoid potentially life-threatening consequences."
839	6818	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnít been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.î This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.
840	6819	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The bumpy roads cause discomfort and jostle the rider, making it difficult to maintain balance. Sand blowing in the eyes can impair vision and cause irritation. The hot and humid temperatures lead to dehydration and exhaustion, making it challenging to keep up a steady pace. When the cyclist becomes too tired to pedal, they may have to dismount and walk, slowing down their progress. In addition, encountering a wild dog on the outskirts of town can be frightening and dangerous. Without any money to buy a drink, the cyclist faces further hardship in quenching their thirst. The setting poses various obstacles and challenges for the cyclist to navigate through, testing their endurance and resilience in the face of adversity.
841	6820	3	3	"The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his surroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads ""I had been hitting my water bottle regularly."" Due to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water, consuming large patterns of it at a time. He was feeling the effects of the scorching sun beating down on him, making him sweat profusely. As he pedaled on, the heat seemed to intensify, causing him to feel drained and exhausted. Despite his efforts to stay hydrated, the relentless heat was taking a toll on his body. The sun was relentless, and the cyclist could feel his energy dwindling with each passing mile. He knew that he had to keep pushing forward, but the oppressive heat was making it increasingly difficult. The cyclist realized that he needed to find some shade soon to take a break and cool down before continuing on his journey. In the midst of the sweltering heat, he remained determined to reach his destination, knowing that he had to persevere through the challenging conditions."
842	6821	3	3	When the cyclist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that itís hot because he is sweating and dehydrated. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, casting harsh shadows on the barren landscape. The air is thick with heat, suffocating and oppressive. The ground beneath the cyclist's tires is cracked and parched, a testament to the unforgiving aridity of the environment. The lack of shade intensifies the blazing conditions, leaving the cyclist exposed to the merciless elements. Every breath feels like inhaling fire, the heat searing his lungs with each gasp. The absence of any signs of life, save for the occasional tumbleweed rolling by, further emphasizes the desolation of the desert surroundings. In this harsh and unforgiving terrain, survival is a constant battle against the elements, where even the most mundane tasks become Herculean feats.
843	6822	3	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically heís fine. ìThe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over themî (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesnít know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, ìIt read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.î he knows that things are going to get rough, because ìthe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mphî. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesnít have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, ìtumble weeds crossed my path.î The landscape seems to get more threatening too, ìa ridiculously large shake.î The landscape changes with the state of water. The lack of water not only affects the cyclist physically but also alters the environment around him, turning what was once a peaceful ride into a challenging and potentially dangerous journey."
844	6823	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the heat and lack of human presence drive him to madness. If he were in a place like @LOCATION2, the heat would still be a challenge, but the presence of people around would provide some comfort and sense of community. However, if he found himself in @LOCATION1, the extreme temperature drop combined with the isolation would likely be fatal for him.
845	6824	3	3	The features of the setting that the cyclist runs into do affect him. For example, when the setting changes from an abandoned town to an empty, deserted road that has not been used in thirty years, it gives the cyclist less motivation to continue and even less strength. The desolate and eerie atmosphere of the deserted road may instill fear and unease in the cyclist, making it harder for him to push forward. Additionally, the lack of any signs of life or civilization can be mentally draining for the cyclist, as he may feel isolated and vulnerable in such a desolate environment. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's mindset and physical abilities during his journey.
846	6825	3	3	Joe Kurmaskieís ìRough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who donít tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, ìThe sun was beginning to beat downÖ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer. The combination of the scorching sun and the challenging terrain made the journey even more arduous for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of being prepared and cautious when exploring unfamiliar routes in extreme conditions.
847	6826	3	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he pasts through a ghost town, then twenty mile up the road he sees a ramshackle shed & some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was running out but all he could get was muck, then what he described as water feeling two-hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid. Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55, he was going 12 mph. Even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, at that point he was out of water. The harsh environment of the setting only added to the challenges the cyclist faced, leaving him desperate for resources and struggling to navigate the treacherous terrain ahead.
848	6827	3	3	Do not Exceed posted speed limit, never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who havenít left the confinses of their porches sin Carter was in the office twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork as sorrs. I got down on my hands and kness, working the handle of the rasted water pump with all my strength. The water bottles contained only a few totalt and sips. He could or been sad person. And he could just be a bum. As I continued on my journey, I realized the importance of self-reliance and perseverance. Despite the challenges I faced, I pushed forward and overcame obstacles with determination. It was a valuable lesson that I learned along the way, reminding me that sometimes, relying on oneself is the only way to reach the destination.
849	6828	3	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist. According to the text ìSometimes life can feel so cruel.î This is a good example because he knew that this road was going to be rough and he was only going 12 mph. So the features of the setting did effect the cyclist. The rough terrain and low speed made the cyclist struggle, showcasing how the setting can impact his experience on the road.
850	6829	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this. The hot weather made him have a dry mouth leading to the lack of water. He used stones in his mouth and he said, ""Iíd read once that sucking of stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate."" He used that to help him survive the ordeal. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, causing sweat to pour down his face and back. The arid landscape offered no shade or relief, intensifying his thirst. Each breath felt like inhaling hot air, parching his throat even more. Despite the harsh conditions, he pressed on, determined to reach his destination. The desolate surroundings only fueled his resolve to keep moving forward, one pedal at a time. In the midst of adversity, he found solace in the simple act of sucking on stones, a small comfort that provided a brief distraction from the overwhelming thirst. As the hours passed, his determination and resourcefulness proved to be his saving grace, allowing him to endure the unforgiving elements and emerge stronger on the other side."
851	6830	3	3	"The features affected the cyclist in many ways, one being the highway sign, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, ìat some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake ìThese roadblock would danger the biker, for heíd have to manever around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water. No water is a great danger for it was June, a hot day and he is risking getting dehydrated. There was also nobody around, so if he desperatly needed water he couldnít. The cyclist faced numerous challenges due to the rough road, roadblocks, and lack of water, making the journey more difficult and dangerous."
852	6831	3	3	"After reading ìDo not Exceed Posted Limit,î I have seen how the scene of an area can affect your mood and attitude. In this story, the cyclist encounters challenging hills that wear him down physically and mentally. The hills, described as ""short, moving hills,"" test his endurance and perseverance as he struggles to pedal up and down. Despite his efforts, he cannot escape the grueling terrain, feeling the cruelty of the road. The road sign warning him not to exceed the speed limit serves as a metaphor for the consequences of taking shortcuts in life. Just like the cyclist facing tough roads, taking shortcuts can lead to unexpected challenges and difficulties. This story highlights the importance of facing obstacles head-on and not trying to bypass them, as the road to success is often filled with ups and downs that must be navigated carefully."
853	6832	3	3	In the short story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting plays a significant role in affecting the cyclist. The dry, hot air of the environment slowly dehydrates him, leading to a loss of reason and playing tricks on his mind. The relentless heat causes him to become disoriented and unable to think clearly. Additionally, the rolling hills in the area exhaust him as he struggles to cycle up them, further depleting his energy reserves. The combination of the intense heat and challenging terrain results in the cyclist using up his much-needed water supply, putting him in a dangerous situation. Overall, the harsh setting in the story deeply impacts the cyclist and adds to the suspense of the narrative.
854	6833	3	3	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which he was in had a major effect. He was in California, which is a big desert. In the middle of summer, it is very hot. Riding a bike on roads in the desert with no trees or shade of any sort is quite harsh. Additionally, being in an area with limited civilization where access to water is scarce can pose a significant issue for the cyclist. The challenging conditions of the desert landscape can greatly impact the cyclist's journey and overall experience.
855	6834	3	3	The features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's journey. The presence of poisonous snakes adds a sense of danger and risk to the already challenging terrain. Riding alone through the hills increases the feeling of isolation and vulnerability, knowing that help is far away. The lack of water sources poses a serious threat to the cyclist's well-being, as dehydration can set in quickly in the desert heat. Despite the obstacles, the cyclist must push forward, keeping a vigilant eye out for any potential dangers. In such a harsh environment, every decision made can have life-threatening consequences. The cyclist's determination and resourcefulness will be put to the test as they navigate through this unforgiving landscape.
856	6835	3	3	The setting is midsummer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid, and very dry. There is a lack of water in his bag. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough, and rigorous roads. The scorching sun beats down on him mercilessly as he trudges through the unforgiving terrain. The dry, dusty air fills his lungs, making each breath a struggle. His throat is parched, and he longs for even a drop of water to quench his thirst. The relentless heat saps his energy, leaving him drained and exhausted. Despite the harsh conditions, he pushes on, driven by the hope of reaching his destination. Every step is a battle against the elements, but he is determined to persevere. With grim determination, he forges ahead, knowing that relief is just around the corner. The desert may be unforgiving, but he is not ready to give up. He will endure the hardships and emerge victorious, his thirst for adventure quenched at last.
857	6836	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they donít want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.
858	6837	3	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water. As the cyclist continues to ride in the scorching heat with his dwindling water supply, the risk of dehydration and heatstroke becomes even more imminent. It is crucial for him to find a water source or a way to replenish his water bottle before it's too late.
859	6838	3	3	There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place, meaning there was no water anywhere to be seen in miles. Also, towns were nowhere to be seen, making it hard to sustain life out there. This quote supports the fact that there weren't many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.'' This shows that there aren't many towns in these parts. It was so hot and thirsty that the man had to suck on stones to take his mind off the thirst, as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst.'' This clearly shows that the man was very thirsty. Additionally, the extreme heat caused the man to see visions, as the text states, ''As the looks after had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' Why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of nowhere? Therefore, these statements above show how settings can affect one's mind and physical conditions as a cyclist, highlighting the challenges faced in such harsh environments.
860	6839	3	3	The setting that affects the cyclist is the condition of the road. The road twists and turns in different directions and inclines, making it challenging for the cyclist to navigate. With @NUM1 miles to go before reaching the town, there is a risk of running out of water. If the cyclist runs out of water before reaching the town, they may need to make stops to prevent dehydration. Once in the town, the cyclist can replenish their water supply and continue on their journey.
861	6840	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thirsty most of his way. As he rode, he started to get tired slowly and got more and more thirsty. He drank his water at first without thinking too much of it, but as he went on, he slowly found himself trying to conserve it. By the time he got to the second wild town, he was so thirsty and tired that he thought it might have been a ""death."" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when they are hot, tired, and desperate for water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long journey to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men. He was exhausted, dehydrated, and on the brink of collapse, but he had finally made it to his destination."
862	6841	3	3	The features of the setting include There are no one in sights, not a building, car, or structure of any kind which describes the trail the cyclist was taking. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his doubting whether he will survive or not. As the cyclist continues down the empty trail, the silence becomes deafening, amplifying his sense of isolation and vulnerability. With no signs of civilization in sight, he is filled with a growing sense of unease, wondering if he will ever make it out of this desolate place alive. The lack of any human presence only adds to his fear, as he grapples with the harsh reality of his situation. The vast emptiness surrounding him serves as a stark reminder of his own mortality, pushing him to his limits both physically and mentally. Will he find a way out of this barren landscape, or will he be forever lost to the unforgiving wilderness?
863	6842	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist. The speed limit sign serves as a reminder of restrictions and limitations, creating a sense of frustration and oppression for the cyclist. On the other hand, the welch's Juice factory represents a beacon of hope and anticipation, sparking excitement and curiosity within him. The deserted fork in the road presents a dilemma and uncertainty, leading to feelings of unease and concern. Ultimately, reaching his destination brings a sense of accomplishment and comfort, relieving any previous tensions or anxieties. The various elements of the setting play a significant role in shaping the cyclist's emotions and experiences throughout his journey.
864	6843	3	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,ìand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced. The harsh conditions of the desert can take a toll on the cyclist's energy and overall performance, making it a challenging and less enjoyable experience.
865	6844	3	3	"The cyclist in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" faced challenges due to the setting in California, a hot place during the summer. With a shortage of water, the cyclist had to conserve it, slowing down his pace. Despite a cool wind and a river from Yosemite, he had to quickly descend down the hill, adding to his difficulties. The setting significantly impacted the cyclist's journey and limited his ability to ride efficiently."
866	6845	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays a crucial role in affecting the cyclist's journey. The scorching heat of the high deserts of California in June limits his water supply and poses a danger to his well-being. The lack of buildings around leaves him feeling isolated and hopeless as he struggles to find the necessary resources to continue his ride. The presence of snakes in the desert adds an element of fear and threat to his already challenging situation. The rough and bumpy road makes it difficult for him to maintain control and progress towards his destination. Despite these obstacles, the cyclist shows determination and perseverance by breaking the ride into smaller, manageable distances.

913	6892	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was troubled by the sight of one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule. This troubling sight indicated to him that there was no water available or that the water was contaminated, leaving him in a difficult situation without the resource he needed.
914	6893	3	3	The conditions of the environment and the road can have a major effect on cyclists. For example, riding a bike in warm weather on flat terrain requires less determination compared to cycling in hot weather on rough, hilly paths. In such challenging conditions, cyclists may risk dehydration and need to exert much more effort to navigate the inclines. Therefore, it is evident that environmental factors significantly impact cyclists and their overall experience on the road.
915	6894	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom. As the cool water revitalizes him, he reflects on the challenges he faced in the desert and the importance of staying hydrated and safe while on the road. The experience serves as a valuable lesson for the cyclist, reminding him to always be prepared and mindful of his surroundings while embarking on future adventures.
916	6895	3	3	In the story, the setting plays a significant role in affecting the cyclist. The terrain, with its challenging hills and windy turns, posed a formidable obstacle for him. The desolate surroundings, devoid of any signs of human habitation, intensified his feelings of isolation and impending danger. The author vividly portrays the harsh terrain, as evidenced by the description of a daunting hill that loomed ahead, with a lone building offering a glimmer of hope in the distance. These details from the setting all contributed to the cyclist's experience, highlighting the impact of the environment on his journey.
917	6896	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, as he found himself in unfamiliar and challenging situations. Despite following advice from older men, the cyclist ended up feeling lost and unsure of his surroundings. Encountering rough roads and unexpected obstacles like a large snake in the middle of the road tested his strength and resolve. The harsh realities of life became apparent as he navigated through these difficult terrains, highlighting the struggles and challenges one may face on a journey.
918	6897	3	3	The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, there would be no refills because the pump was only giving a tarlike substance. With the lack of water, dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the ridiculously large snake he had seen. A final effect would be mirages that could lose your judgment. This man double-checked his eyes when coming in view of a building by wiping the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. Through all the toughest dessert obstacles, the character was able to take the shortcut and survive the heat, dehydration, and animals of the desert. He made it through the challenges with determination and a strong will to reach his destination.
919	6898	3	3	"The features in the setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit"" have a significant impact on the cyclist. The scorching heat of approximately 90 degrees makes the journey challenging, while the unhelpful advice from locals adds to the difficulty. The rough road ahead, with a large snake blocking the path, presents additional obstacles for the cyclist to overcome. These elements create a tense and challenging atmosphere for the protagonist as he navigates through the unforgiving environment."
920	6899	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very severe situation. The cyclist was in a desert, a barren land with sparse population along his route, leading to a scarcity of fresh water supplies and extreme temperatures. The risk of heatstroke loomed large, as the cyclist could have easily fainted from the combination of dehydration, scorching heat, and physical exertion. In such a remote area, the lack of readily available water sources heightened the danger he faced. Additionally, the presence of snakes added another layer of risk, as a snake bite could have proved fatal, especially considering the cyclist was miles away from the nearest help. If the setting had been different, such as a city park or a more populated countryside, the cyclist would have had easier access to water sources and medical assistance, significantly reducing the potential hazards he encountered.
921	6900	3	3	"The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says ""and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June."" Also, he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says ""I was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so cruel."" In conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration. This highlights the importance of being adequately prepared and hydrated when engaging in physical activities to avoid such dangerous situations."
922	6901	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because heís in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.î This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car. As the cyclist continued on his journey, the scorching sun beat down on him, intensifying the feeling of thirst. Each pedal became more arduous as dehydration set in, making the final stretch to Yosemite seem like an impossible feat. The unforgiving landscape offered no respite, with no signs of civilization in sight. The lack of water transformed a challenging ride into a fight for survival, highlighting the critical importance of being adequately prepared for such demanding expeditions in remote areas.
923	6902	3	3	In the essay, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the experiences of the cyclist as he navigates through the harsh desert landscape with limited water supply. The scorching heat, treacherous hills, and presence of deadly snakes all contribute to the dangerous nature of the journey. Given these challenging conditions, it is clear that listening to the seasoned advice of the cyclist is essential for survival, while disregarding the guidance of older individuals could lead to perilous consequences. Ultimately, the setting serves as a powerful backdrop that underscores the importance of heeding the warnings and insights of those who have first-hand experience in such unforgiving terrain.
924	6903	3	3	"On the cyclist's journey to Yosemite National Park, he encounters a lot of hardships due to the setting he's around and the advice given by old men. Riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of California isn't good to begin with, adding to the cyclist's dehydration state. He first comes across ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lament mule."" By that description of his surroundings, it seems as if he might be in a ghost town by himself, which could strand him. He described the terrain with ""short, rolling hills"" and ""over one long, crippling hill."" This shows some of the obstacles that he had to go through on a bike just to get to Yosemite National Park. He realized once he encountered these features of the terrain that he was off track and needed to find help. After surviving his surroundings for as long as he could go, he gets help at a real camp. The settings of the story play a significant role in the cyclist's ordeal."
925	6904	3	3	"""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" is an inspiring and almost humorous essay that takes the reader inside a journey in a cyclist's daily routine. In this story, the author fights dehydration as he tries to make it to a national park with shortcut directions from ""old timers."" The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist, and the pity the reader feels for him is palpable.  Halfway through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly 50 miles; that's extremely crazy. The fact that he is traveling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, and two sentences later, he mentions that the sun was beating down. At that point, he wasn't really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to pedal was when he states, ""flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far; the rocky roads probably didn't help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn't have been pedaling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclists really go through.  As the story unfolds, the reader is transported to the challenging environment the cyclist finds himself in, emphasizing the physical and mental strength required to endure such a journey. The harsh setting serves as a backdrop to highlight the determination and resilience of the cyclist, making his achievement all the more impressive."
926	6905	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather. This affects him because he might get dehydrated. In conclusion there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist, such as the rough road conditions and the challenging weather, making the journey more difficult and increasing the risk of dehydration.
927	6907	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if there werenít hills and rough roads, he would of been able to get to Yosemite Park faster and he wouldnít have run out of water. The challenging terrain made it more difficult for him to maintain a steady pace, causing him to exert more energy than anticipated. Additionally, the rough roads increased the risk of puncturing his tires, leading to delays and further setbacks. The lack of easily accessible water sources along the way also played a significant role in his struggles, as staying hydrated is crucial for endurance and stamina during long rides. In a more favorable setting with smoother paths and readily available water stations, the cyclist would have been able to reach his destination more efficiently and comfortably. Ultimately, the features of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist's journey and overall experience.
928	6908	3	3	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a ìsubstanceî it had a flavor of battery acid. ìIf he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist. The harsh conditions of the environment intensified the cyclist's feelings of frustration and discomfort, making his situation even more challenging.
929	6909	3	3	In my opinion, the changing terrain and speed limits mentioned by the cyclist in the sales pitch can greatly impact their experience. When faced with challenging conditions like sandy terrain that depletes water quickly, it can make the ride more difficult and exhausting. This could lead to the cyclist feeling fatigued and hesitant to continue on their journey. It is important for cyclists to be aware of these factors and prepare accordingly to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride. Ultimately, the features of the selling can significantly influence the cyclist's overall experience and perception of the route.
930	6910	3	3	"Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert, the cyclist is affected. In the short story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist is traveling through the hot desert in June when he realizes he's running out of water, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because he's becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also, the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, ""The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June"" (Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him. The combination of the scorching weather, lack of water, and unfamiliar surroundings creates a dangerous situation for the cyclist as he struggles to navigate through the unforgiving California desert."
931	6911	3	3	The setting of this story affects the cyclist a lot. The run-down, out-of-date town where he found himself lost only added to his difficulties. The hot, dehydrating environment made it even more challenging for him to find his way. As he struggled in the scorching sun, the lack of water caused him to hallucinate and become disoriented. The setting of the story, with its outdated town and oppressive heat, had a significant impact on the cyclist, making his journey even more arduous and perilous.
932	6912	3	3	The cyclist in the setting is affected by the lack of water due to the intense heat of the high desert in California in June. He had to drink from his water bottle regularly to stay hydrated during his journey. The harsh conditions of the setting made it challenging for him to conserve water, impacting his trip significantly.
933	6913	3	3	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smooth terrain, but when you encounter rolling hills, it becomes much tougher. The biker noticed the changing terrain as flat roads were replaced by short, challenging hills. The weather was hot, causing him to sweat and become dehydrated. With eighteen miles to go until the next town and limited water, he was in a difficult situation. The first town he passed through was deserted and had no drinkable water, making his journey even more strenuous. In such conditions, it is crucial to always be prepared and informed about the route you are taking.
934	6914	3	3	The cyclist has to endure rough terrain and bad road conditions, and a lack of water is the last thing he needs in this situation. The possibility of heat stroke looms over him, threatening his journey. However, just when things seem bleak, he stumbles upon an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory. This unexpected discovery gives him a glimmer of hope amidst the challenges he faces.
935	6915	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskieís ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1î the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldnít worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldnít have been so worried. Whatís interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldnít have struggled so much at the end. ìAt some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.î(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.
936	6916	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel"" implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought he was gonna die at any moment. The scorching sun beat down on him relentlessly, draining his energy with each passing minute. The lack of shade or any source of water intensified his struggle, pushing him to his limits. The rugged terrain seemed never-ending, with steep inclines that challenged his physical strength and mental fortitude. Despite the overwhelming obstacles, he pushed forward, driven by a fierce determination to survive. Every pedal stroke was a battle, every breath a victory against the harsh elements. The setting posed a formidable challenge, but it also brought out the cyclist's resilience and inner strength. As he fought against the unforgiving environment, he discovered a newfound sense of courage and perseverance within himself. In the face of adversity, he refused to give up, knowing that his survival depended on his unwavering willpower. The setting may have been cruel, but it also shaped him into a stronger, more resilient individual."
937	6917	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the author is continually depressed by the features of the landscape he passes. At first, he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn't bother him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a ""rusted water pump,"" and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path. After that, he passes an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting and its features serve to disappoint and depress the cyclist in his quest to find water. The harsh and desolate landscape only adds to his sense of hopelessness and isolation, making his journey even more challenging."
938	6918	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" a cyclist is faced with many problems. It's really hot out, practically a desert, and it's in June. Just knowing that makes me want some water. Also, this cyclist is running short of water and still hasn't got to the place he needs to be. The roads are hills and bumpy, which make it harder for him. These are the problems this cyclist is faced with. The scorching heat of the desert-like conditions, coupled with the scarcity of water, adds to the cyclist's challenges. The rough, hilly roads further test his endurance and determination. Will he be able to overcome these obstacles and reach his destination safely? Only time will tell."
939	6919	3	3	At First the narrator in Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit was energetic and enthusiastic about their journey to Yosemite National Park. After getting some helpful advice about a few shortcuts, the cyclist sets out for adventure. The first thing they encounter is a ghost town. The gentlemen they had taken advice from had assured them it was a booming, prosperous town. This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist's mind. Then, the lack of water began to be a problem. They were travelling through the high deserts of California in June and slowly running out of water. Flat road was soon replaced by short, rolling hills which only increased the cyclist's state of deliriousness. After a few more disappointments, the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die. The reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist. All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist, and you can't stop reading because you have to find out what happens. If it weren't for the hopelessness of the setting, you wouldn't care.
940	6920	3	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through a desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat road and dirt. He is riding on the road, hopelessly hoping for some form of life. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The author is trying to be positive, but it's hard because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert? Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn't be that worried; there's water and shade. He has none of that in the desert. This whole journey was all mental. He always kept in his mind that everything would be okay. That is what helped him survive. This is an inspiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stay optimistic. The power of positive thinking can truly make a difference in challenging situations like the one faced by the cyclist in the desert.
941	6921	3	3	Poor directions, heat, and lack of water were significant challenges faced by the cyclist in the story. Initially confident in the directions that promised to shorten his ride to Yosemite National Park, the cyclist's confidence waned as he found himself battling the scorching heat of a California June day, causing him to quickly deplete his water supply. Struggling to stay hydrated in the high desert, he was on the verge of heat stroke, with only a few precious sips left in his water bottles. Pushing forward in his dehydrated state, he hoped for a source of water to appear. His determination paid off when he stumbled upon a barst shop, where he was able to replenish his water supply. With his thirst quenched and his troubles behind him, the cyclist could continue on his journey with renewed vigor.
942	6922	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, causing the cyclist to feel drained and exhausted. The dry, arid landscape offers no respite, with no shade in sight to provide relief. The lack of water sources exacerbates the cyclist's predicament, making the search for hydration a matter of survival. The harsh environment of the desert amplifies the challenges faced by the cyclist, pushing them to their limits both physically and mentally. In such unforgiving conditions, every decision becomes critical, and every resource must be carefully managed. Ultimately, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and decisions as they navigate the harsh desert terrain.
943	6923	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldnít ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didnít help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldnít be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.
944	6924	3	3	"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak along with the rough terrain. The lack of water doesnít help any when heís thirsty because of the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more dalerious he gets. Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there Iíll be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, ìit didnít really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean"". mentally he couldnít make it."
945	6925	3	3	When the rider was riding his bike in such day settings has started to need water he was running out, So his whole adventure was to find water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him not want to keep going because he was so tired. It made him harder on him. But it also got him more strength and because in himself, and keep on pushing. As he rode on, the scorching sun beat down on him, intensifying his thirst.

At first, he didn't really notice, but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills. The road change and the heat made him say ""I could drop from heatstroke."" Then, because of the old towns he went through, he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality. The challenging road conditions and lack of hydration due to the dilapidated towns made his journey even more difficult and dangerous. The narrator had to navigate not only the rough terrain but also the scorching heat and scarce resources, adding layers of complexity to his already arduous journey."

951	6931	3	3	"The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" had a particularly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly pedaling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist's water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more marred.

These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They definitely affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her own. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike, and an empty water bottle. The sense of isolation and the lack of resources amplified the impact of the desolate setting on her mental state, creating a heightened sense of fear and vulnerability.
954	6934	3	3	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much. Because he took a shortcut he had an even longer journey than before. He was in the middle of nowhere with barely any water left and on top of all that heís exhausted from all the hills on the terrain. So because he took a shortcut it ended up costing him in the long run. The cyclist was now faced with the consequences of his decision, realizing that taking shortcuts doesn't always lead to a quicker or easier journey. He had to push through his exhaustion and find a way to replenish his water supply before continuing on his path.

955	6935	3	3	The cyclist's decision-making was heavily influenced by the setting he found himself in. By listening to the advice of individuals who were out of touch with current information, not seeking alternative opinions, and ultimately disregarding the guidance provided by his map, he put himself at great risk. Trusting his instincts and relying on reliable sources could have prevented the dangerous situation he ended up in due to heat stroke.

956	6936	3	3	"In the essay, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has a negative impact on the cyclist as he struggles in a hot area without access to water. As depicted in the text, the cyclist's desperate attempt to find water only leads to disappointment, with a tar-like substance oozing out of a rusted water pump. This lack of hydration exacerbates his physical discomfort and adds to the challenges he faces on his journey. Additionally, the seemingly endless road ahead makes him doubt whether he will ever reach his destination. Despite these obstacles, the cyclist eventually perseveres and arrives at his intended location, where he finally obtains some much-needed water. The adverse setting serves to highlight the harsh conditions faced by the cyclist, underscoring the importance of being prepared and cautious while traveling in challenging environments."
957	6937	3	3	"The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main character is biking through a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will barely die. The main character says, ""The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main character's energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main character's biggest problem is the heat of the setting. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, making each pedal stroke a struggle against the oppressive heat. The main character's throat is parched, and every breath feels like inhaling hot air from an oven. The intense heat blurs the horizon, making it difficult to gauge how far the next town is. The main character pushes on, fighting against the relentless heat that threatens to overcome him. The setting's unforgiving conditions pose a formidable challenge that the main character must conquer to survive the harsh desert landscape."
958	6938	3	3	"The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ""town"" (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. no on lived there, It was abandoned. Around the cyclist was deserts, and more empty towns. The father the cyclist got, the more we realized the old men were wrong as the cyclest was running low on water and there was no where to stop. He finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again."
959	6939	3	3	All the features of the area have a big effect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated and losing strength. It seems like he might have collapsed if he hadn't thought he was going to pass out, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him. As he takes a long sip of water, he feels the cool liquid rejuvenating his tired body. He takes a moment to rest and catch his breath before getting back on his bike to continue his journey. The harsh conditions of the deserted area have tested his resilience, but he is determined to reach his destination. With renewed energy and determination, he pushes forward, the challenging terrain and unforgiving heat no match for his determination.
960	6940	3	3	The features of the setting in ìRough Road: Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist in a very negative way. It begins slowly with the ìghost town.î The narrator ìchuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,î he wasnít especially worried, but the fact he checked his water suggests that heíll need to ration it for a while. The decline continues when he reaches the ìramshackle shed.î The description of the place shows you he did not like it, and he confirms that with the words, ìthis sight was troubling.î He wouldnít be replenishing his water here. Any more of this, heíd be dead, either from dehydration or from pessimism. Eventually, he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea. This is ironic; he was only going 12 mph, to put it in his own words, ìsometimes life can be so cruel.î He quite obviously hates the setting, and itís all the fault of the setting.
961	6941	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didnít bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.
962	6942	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They donít come out and say it, but they do say, îThe sun was beginning to beat down.î We all know that if you're outside when it's hot, you get hot too. It also probably added to his dehydration. As a long-distance runner, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day. That is how the setting affects the cyclist. Additionally, the rough terrain and uneven road surfaces may have caused the cyclist to exert more energy and focus on maintaining balance, leading to increased fatigue. The surrounding landscape, with its steep hills and sharp turns, could have also impacted the cyclist's speed and overall performance. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and presenting various challenges that must be overcome.
963	6943	3	3	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. If the desert were not a deserted mountainous area in California, the cyclist would not face the same challenges. Changing any aspect of the setting would alter the cyclist's experience and potentially change the entire story. For example, if the cyclist were in an urban or suburban area, the dangers and obstacles would be vastly different from those in a rugged mountainous region. The setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's journey and ultimately determines how the plot unfolds.
964	6944	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the feature of the setting seems negative to the cyclist. The setting starts worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next miles easily. For example, the cyclist says ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,"" indicating his concern that things might not be as easy as he initially thought. As the journey progresses, the setting worsens for the cyclist, leading him to exclaim, ""It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" This is when the cyclist realizes his fear of dehydration. Despite these challenges, the cyclist ultimately makes it through, underscoring the significant impact nature can have on an individual."
965	6945	3	3	"The cyclist continued his journey through the desert-like setting of California, facing unexpected challenges along the way. His water supply dwindled quickly under the scorching sun, leaving him desperate for a town to replenish his resources. Unfortunately, the first town he stumbled upon was nothing more than a ""ghost town"", with rusted pumps offering only foul-tasting liquid.  Despite being assured by locals that a town was nearby, the dehydrated cyclist found himself struggling to reach his destination. The winding roads and small hills only added to his fatigue, while a large tumbleweed blocking his path served as a stark reminder of the harsh environment he was in.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the cyclist spotted a town with a bait shop where he could finally rest and rehydrate. As he sipped on cool water, he reflected on the challenges he had faced and the importance of being prepared for the unexpected in such unforgiving settings. With renewed energy, he continued his journey, grateful for the lessons learned along the way."
966	6946	3	3	"The setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, ìI could drop from heatstrokeî (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a ëheatstrokeí which could slow him down. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist. The challenging terrain, scorching heat, and lack of cool water all contributed to the cyclist's struggles on the road."
967	6947	3	3	The features of the setting greatly impact the cyclist's journey. Without the advice from the old men, the boy may have encountered even more trouble along the way. However, despite the challenges he faced, the boy managed to reach his destination. Moving forward, he plans to rely on his map to avoid any further dangerous situations. The setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and decisions, highlighting the importance of being prepared and seeking guidance when needed.
968	6948	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist as the road's condition becomes rougher the further they ride.

In conclusion, the setting's features play a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience and can add an element of excitement and adventure to their ride.
969	6949	3	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a ìrun-downî rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in a dense forest, he could have collected water from a stream or river. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.
970	6950	3	3	The features along the cyclist's route can have a significant impact on their journey. Everything from the condition of the road to the presence of rocks and other obstacles can affect the cyclist's experience. It is crucial for cyclists to be knowledgeable about their surroundings to avoid potential dangers such as snakes, rough terrain, and obstacles in their path. This is why cyclists often prefer to ride on roads with fewer cars, allowing them to focus on their own safety and navigate any challenges they may encounter. In the end, the ability for a cyclist to rely on their own instincts and knowledge of the terrain can make all the difference in ensuring a safe and enjoyable ride.
971	6951	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they provide a vibrant backdrop for their journey. The lush greenery, winding paths, and chirping birds all add to the overall experience of cycling through the countryside. The sun shining through the leaves, the sound of a nearby stream, and the scent of wildflowers in the air all contribute to the sense of freedom and adventure that comes with cycling. Without these elements, the cyclist's ride would feel dull and uninspired. The setting brings the story to life, making it more engaging and enjoyable to read. The details of the setting create a rich tapestry for the cyclist's journey, making it feel like a true escape into nature.
972	6952	3	3	At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if itís too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run. It is crucial for cyclists to be aware of the environmental conditions they may encounter during their rides, especially in extreme heat. Proper hydration and protection from the sun are essential to prevent heat-related illnesses and ensure a safe cycling experience. Additionally, staying alert for potential hazards such as snakes can help cyclists avoid dangerous encounters. By taking precautions and being prepared for challenging conditions, cyclists can enjoy their rides while staying safe and healthy.
973	6953	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" really goes against the cyclist and his journey. In the places he travels, there is a lack of water, and the water available is of poor quality. For instance, a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn't cool down, highlighting the challenges the cyclist faced with water sources. The harsh conditions of the environment pose a significant obstacle for the cyclist as he navigates through his journey, adding to the difficulty and danger he encounters. These adverse conditions create a sense of tension and struggle for the cyclist, making his expedition even more challenging."

975	6955	3	3	The feature of the setting included nice cool pines and then a ghost town, with the heat becoming more intense as he continued on his journey. Initially enjoying the refreshing shade of the pines, his mood shifted when he caught sight of the eerie ghost town in the distance. The temperature rose steadily, causing him to worry about dehydration as he scanned the barren landscape for signs of life. Suddenly, he spotted what he thought was a stranded baby, only to realize it was a discarded snack wrapper. Anxious and fatigued, he pressed on, the hills growing steeper and more challenging to traverse. As he struggled against the unforgiving terrain, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease creeping over him. The juxtaposition of the serene pines and the desolate ghost town, coupled with the relentless heat and treacherous hills, created a sense of foreboding that lingered in the air.
976	6956	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he couldn't find any streams or rivers to refill his water bottle, he realized the importance of proper hydration in such challenging conditions. The rugged landscape also tested his endurance and skills, pushing him to his limits as he navigated the rough terrain. Despite the challenges, the cyclist found a sense of satisfaction in overcoming the obstacles presented by the setting, ultimately making him a stronger and more resilient rider.
977	6957	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was ""travelling through the high deserts of California in June."" This is a very hot time of year, and when a person gets lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person gets extremely thirsty. Not to mention the ""sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,"" which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist. The challenging terrain and scorching heat combined to make his journey more difficult and demanding."
978	6958	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has nothing for miles. Just ghost towns, making it impossible to find any water. Also, it's a desert-like setting, adding to his thirst. The hills in the area made him even thirstier. It was June in California, so it must have been pretty hot, and the town that he came to had no water because it seemed deserted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It's a trick that lets you survive a lot more effectively. Therefore, the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn't take the old man's advice. The harsh and unforgiving environment posed numerous challenges for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of being prepared and cautious when venturing into such treacherous landscapes.
979	6959	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didnít have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions.
980	6960	3	3	I think that the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The weather conditions, with the intense heat that could lead to heatstroke, have a significant impact on him. Additionally, the lack of water exacerbates his dehydration, making it difficult for him to maintain his balance. The absence of any cars or people around him adds to his sense of isolation and vulnerability in this challenging environment. All these factors combine to have a profound effect on the cyclist as he navigates through the harsh setting.
981	6961	3	3	In ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more. ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldnít find another place for quite a while. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sign that said ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limitî, and passed tumbleweeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist. The challenging terrain and harsh conditions of the desert forced the cyclist to be more cautious and mindful of his resources, making his journey more difficult and demanding.
982	6962	3	3	He feels the weight of solitude pressing down on him as he navigates the challenging terrain alone, with no one by his side to offer encouragement or support. Despite the obstacles that lie ahead - the rugged paths and towering hills that seem insurmountable - he is driven by an unyielding determination to see this through to the end. The road may be tough, but his resolve is tougher. With every step, he pushes himself closer to the finish line, fueled by the fire within that refuses to be extinguished. In the face of adversity, he stands tall, unwavering in his pursuit of victory. And though the journey may be long and arduous, he knows that the sweet taste of success at the end will make it all worthwhile.
983	6963	3	3	Heat, abandoned roads, and snakes all posed significant challenges for the cyclist. The scorching heat led to rapid dehydration as he exerted himself on the grueling journey. The desolate, abandoned roads only heightened his sense of isolation and uncertainty about his decision to embark on this treacherous bike ride. As his water supply dwindled, desperation set in when he finally reached an old pump, only to find murky, undrinkable water. The presence of a snake along the path added a dangerous element to an already perilous situation. All of these obstacles stemmed from his choice to ignore the advice of the seasoned locals. Had he heeded their warnings, perhaps his journey would have been less fraught with danger and uncertainty. Ultimately, his defiance led to a harrowing ordeal that tested his endurance and survival instincts in the face of nature's formidable challenges.
984	6964	3	3	The features and setting greatly impacted the cyclist's experience. Being in the desert meant facing extreme heat, increasing the risk of heatstroke. The old, rusted water pump provided water that tasted like battery acid, highlighting the scarcity of clean resources. These conditions made it challenging for the cyclist to stay hydrated and safe during the journey.
985	6965	3	3	"The features of the setting intensely affect the cyclist over a period of time. Destined to reach Yosemite National Park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. Next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted. ""With what I believed to be my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill."" That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills affected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replenished with confidence he had before when he ""rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile."" The changing landscape and resources along the journey had a significant impact on the cyclist's physical and mental state, highlighting the interconnectedness between the environment and the individual's experience."
986	6966	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water. The harsh desert terrain made it difficult for the cyclist to maneuver his bike, with sand and rocks posing constant obstacles. The abandoned towns offered no respite or opportunity for replenishing supplies. The scorching heat of June caused the cyclist to sweat profusely, leading to dehydration and exhaustion. With limited water, the cyclist had to ration his supply carefully, knowing that finding more would be a challenge in the deserted landscape. The unforgiving setting tested the cyclist's endurance and resourcefulness, pushing him to his limits as he continued his journey through the arid desert.
987	6967	3	3	"In the essay ""Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience. The deserted towns and abandoned structures along the way create a sense of isolation and uncertainty for the cyclist. As he navigates through these desolate landscapes, his worries about running out of water and the possibility of not making it to Yosemite intensify. However, the appearance of an open store towards the end brings a glimmer of hope and relief to the cyclist. This shift in setting from desolation to a place of respite highlights the impact of surroundings on one's emotions and perceptions. Ultimately, the changing settings along the cyclist's journey evoke feelings of fear, resilience, and finally, gratitude for finding a beacon of hope in the midst of emptiness."
988	6968	3	3	The author's setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. It was early summer, indicating hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. As the cyclist reached the first town, the sun beat down relentlessly, intensifying the heat. Riding in such conditions requires immense effort and can lead to faster dehydration due to increased sweating. Furthermore, the cyclist traversed through the high deserts of California, adding to the scorching temperatures. The journey continued on short, rolling hills, which demanded even more physical exertion from the cyclist. Navigating through these challenging terrains under the blazing sun posed a significant test of endurance and strength for the rider.
989	6969	3	3	The harsh desert setting posed a great challenge for the cyclist, from the abandoned ghost town to the bait shop. With water running low, he resorted to desperate measures to keep going. The scorching heat made each mile feel like a never-ending struggle, but the sight of the bait shop brought a sense of relief. It was his sanctuary in the unforgiving desert. Despite the lack of direction from the old-timers, he was determined to push through. The drive to survive and the brutal climate were the defining factors in his journey. With sheer determination, he pressed on towards the light, refusing to let the desert defeat him.
990	6970	3	3	The cyclist's desperation grew as he realized he was lost in the scorching heat of the California desert. His throat parched and his body weak, he knew he was running out of time. With no water left to quench his thirst, he felt like he was on the brink of collapse. Summoning the last ounces of strength he had, he pushed himself to keep moving forward. Despite the challenges and obstacles in his path, he was determined to reach his destination. The road ahead may have been long and arduous, but the cyclist knew he had to persevere. With sheer determination and resilience, he continued his journey, hoping that he would soon find relief and salvation.
991	6971	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes the challenging terrain he encounters while cycling. He notes a shift from flat roads to rolling hills, indicating a more difficult path ahead. Additionally, he mentions the lack of any signs of civilization, such as buildings or cars, leaving him with limited options for obtaining water or assistance. These setting features significantly impact the cyclist's journey, making it more physically demanding and isolated. The combination of rugged terrain and sparse surroundings creates a sense of vulnerability and reinforces the importance of caution and preparedness while navigating such challenging conditions. Ultimately, Kurmaskie's experience highlights the unpredictable nature of outdoor adventures and the need to adapt to changing environments to ensure a safe and successful journey."
992	6972	3	3	"Almost all the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. ""The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. Wet rings of sweat circled my shirt."" These descriptions suggest that he is very hot since he is sweaty and he's been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. ""I began breaking the ride down into distances I could make it to."" He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it. The challenging terrain and the scorching heat create a tough environment for the cyclist, testing his endurance and determination."
993	6973	3	3	The setting was extremely challenging for the cyclist due to the distance, water, and heat, all of which exacerbated each other. As time passed, the cyclist grew increasingly fatigued from the scorching heat, making the journey even more arduous.
994	6974	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end ironically hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first ""town"" and described it as having only ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral."" This is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry. He also couldn't refill his water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in. Already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cyclist became unconfident that he could make it. Finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp - If you want bait for the big ones, we're your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe the atmosphere and surroundings can affect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist. The harsh and desolate setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's emotions and outlook on his journey."
995	6975	3	3	The lack of a town along the cyclist's route means there is limited access to water, increasing the risk of dehydration. Additionally, the flat roads transitioning into rolling hills present a physical challenge that requires the cyclist to exert more effort and focus during the ride. These environmental factors significantly impact the cyclist's experience and performance on the road.
996	6976	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist as the terrain he is riding on includes many hills, causing him to become tired more quickly. Additionally, extreme weather conditions, such as cold or hot temperatures, can also impact the cyclist's performance and attitude during the ride. These environmental factors play a significant role in influencing the cyclist's overall experience and ability to navigate through the challenges presented by the road.
997	6977	3	3	The cyclist is faced with a challenging situation as they have to cover a vast distance to reach the next town. With limited water supply and scorching heat all around, the journey becomes even more demanding. The barren landscape offers no respite, with no signs of civilization in sight for miles on end. This harsh setting puts the cyclist's endurance and survival skills to the test, making each pedal stroke a struggle against the elements. Despite the unforgiving conditions, the cyclist pushes on, fueled by determination and the hope of reaching their destination. In such a desolate environment, every mile conquered is a victory, showcasing the resilience and tenacity of the human spirit in the face of adversity.
998	6978	3	3	The cyclist's journey was greatly impacted by the changing landscapes around him. As the futures of the setting shifted, he found himself lost and confused, unsure of which path to take. Despite the advice of others, he realized that he alone knew where he needed to go. By trusting his own instincts and ignoring the distractions of those around him, he was able to find his way and continue on his journey with confidence. In the end, he learned that sometimes the best guidance comes from within, and that staying true to oneself is key to reaching your destination.
999	6979	3	3	"In the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" many features of the setting affected the cyclist. The road changed from flat to short, rolling hills, requiring more energy to navigate the inclines. Additionally, the cyclist lacked water, leading to dehydration and further energy depletion. With no one around to provide support, the cyclist faced emotional breakdowns that compounded his physical exhaustion. Ultimately, the cyclist's journey was marked by a significant loss of energy and a lack of assistance, highlighting the challenging nature of his solo ride."
1000	6980	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, ""Theyíd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt"" (Kurmaskie). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey. The familiarity with the surroundings can also help the cyclist feel more confident and safe while riding. Additionally, the setting can impact the difficulty of the ride, with factors such as terrain and weather playing a significant role. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and journey."
1001	6981	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist faces rough obstacles on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Despite his lack of water and the intense heat, he encounters a large snake that he mistakes for a diamondback. Pushing through the challenges, he continues on his path, determined to reach the park safely. The reason he takes this route is due to receiving incorrect directions from ""old-timers who havenít left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office."" This misinformation leads to a series of events that could have been avoided if he had been more attentive to his surroundings and the advice of others. Nonetheless, the cyclist perseveres, demonstrating resilience and determination in the face of adversity."
1002	6982	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways as he travels through the town. The abandoned Welch's Juice bottle factory intimidates him, making him question the wisdom of the old men. However, the sight of a bolt shop still in business brings relief, as he is able to drink water and be near civilization. These surroundings make him feel indifferent, confident, and ultimately relieved to have found signs of life in the desert town.

The water becomes a saving grace in the setting, rejuvenating the tired cyclist. Despite the harsh elements and obstacles, he finds solace in the simple act of quenching his thirst and regaining his strength.
1050	7030	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. ""... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cyclist. The harsh environment of the desert, with its scorching temperatures and lack of shade, adds to the physical strain on the cyclist. The sand, in addition to making him thirsty, also makes it difficult to maintain traction and control on the bike. The overall setting creates a challenging and demanding experience for the cyclist, pushing him to his limits both physically and mentally."
1051	7031	3	3	The cyclist's pursuit of a spectacular and amazing destination is driven by his desire for a perfect spot filled with stories. He seems to judge each place he encounters solely based on its appearance, as seen when he reached a ghost town that did not meet his expectations. Despite this, he still seeks out directions, showing a willingness to explore new paths. His determination to find the ideal location reflects a sense of adventure and a refusal to let anything stand in his way. In the end, his quest for the perfect spot continues, fueled by the belief that once he finds it, he will uncover a wealth of unforgettable experiences.
1052	7032	3	3	The setting can greatly impact a cyclist, affecting factors such as thirst and fatigue. In hot weather, the cyclist may become dehydrated and sweaty, while tackling hilly terrain can lead to increased exhaustion. Despite these challenges, the cyclist remains determined to reach the next town. Breaking the ride into manageable distances helps maintain motivation, with the cyclist pushing through each segment with the belief that success is achievable. Although faced with demanding conditions, the cyclist's strong spirit and unwavering determination enable them to persevere and overcome the obstacles in their path.
1053	7033	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where itís nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. Heís excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welchís Grape Juice Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.
1054	7034	3	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldnít hold the largest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town, sometimes the things are psychologically damaging. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it ñ had been a Welchís Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. For someone who is quickly running out of water, this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist. Additionally, the barren landscape offers no shade or relief from the scorching sun, further adding to the cyclist's physical and mental exhaustion. The constant struggle against the elements takes a toll on his body and mind, making each pedal stroke feel like an uphill battle. As he pushes forward, the unforgiving terrain serves as a constant reminder of his vulnerability and the harsh reality of his situation. Despite the challenges he faces, the cyclist knows that giving up is not an option. With sheer determination and grit, he pushes himself to persevere, one pedal at a time, towards his ultimate goal of reaching safety and salvation.
1055	7035	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the climate affected him the most as he became too hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated, leading to a lack of energy. Additionally, the rough terrain of the road, with its rocky, bumpy, winding hills, exacerbated his struggle, especially with dehydration making it even more challenging. The lack of shade and water along the route, combined with the relentless sun beating down on him, intensified his physical and mental exhaustion. Overall, the harsh setting posed significant obstacles for the cyclist, testing his endurance and resilience throughout the journey.
1056	7036	3	3	During the cyclist's journey, they encountered various obstacles that made their path more challenging. From rough roads to a depleted water pump, abandoned buildings, and false hopes, each new trial tested the cyclist's perseverance. Despite facing disappointment at every turn, the cyclist continued to push forward, fueled by a glimmer of hope with each new discovery. The constant cycle of hope and letdown created a sense of anticipation for the reader, wondering what would happen next. Ultimately, the cyclist's determination prevailed, showing resilience in the face of adversity.
1057	7037	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists. The bumpy and uneven roads caused discomfort and potential danger for the cyclist, requiring extra caution and skill to navigate through. Additionally, the presence of hills added a physical challenge, demanding more effort and energy to conquer the inclines. These combined factors made the cycling experience more demanding and strenuous for the cyclist, impacting their performance and overall enjoyment of the ride.
1058	7038	3	3	There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. This desolation made it hard for the cyclist to find hope and resources, especially water. The scorching heat of June in the desert of @LOCATION1 with little water around left him feeling desperate and abandoned. The possibility of collapsing from a heat stroke loomed over him, with no one in sight to offer assistance. The vast emptiness only accentuated his isolation and vulnerability, highlighting the harsh reality of being stranded in such an unforgiving environment. As he pedaled on, the weight of his situation bore down on him, driving home the stark realization of his solitude in the midst of nature's relentless heat.
1059	7039	3	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and tired the cyclist out faster. Additionally, the hot sun posed a risk of dehydration while riding. As a result, the combination of challenging terrain and scorching sun led to the cyclist feeling exhausted.
1060	7040	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist as he navigates through the high deserts of California in June. The starting setting at a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California on an early summer evening sets the tone for the cyclist's journey. The high temperatures pose a challenge, leading to the main conflict of dehydration. The scorching sun beats down on the cyclist as he pushes forward towards his destination, Yosemite, where he envisions cool pines and rushing rivers. Along the way, he encounters obstacles like a large snake on the road. Despite the difficulties, the cyclist remains determined to reach Yosemite and is relieved when he finally finds water. The setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, highlighting the contrasts between the harsh desert terrain and the lush paradise he is striving towards. Through perseverance and resilience, the cyclist overcomes the challenges of the rough road ahead."
1061	7041	3	3	"The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began to change, the speaker's determination did too, ""Flat roads were replaced by short hills."" The terrain began to change, and the speaker became doubtful of the old man who directed him towards the shortcut. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades."" The heat in the desert made the speaker thirsty, causing him to drink all his water. With no source of water, he decided to suck on a stone. ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst."" However, the bumpy terrain didn't allow him to do that, and he accidentally swallowed the stone. Panic set in, ""I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean."" Luckily, the author's thoughts changed after he found a supply of water. The features of the desert had a significant impact on the cyclist."
1062	7042	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his ìshortcutî he was in great doubt of his survival. ìI was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.î He thought he wouldnít get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. ìAnd the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.î As he pedaled on, the scorching sun beat down on him relentlessly, with no shade in sight. The vast expanse of barren land stretched out before him, devoid of any signs of life. With each passing minute, his throat grew drier, and his body weaker. The isolation of the desolate landscape only added to his feelings of despair and hopelessness. The lack of civilization around him made him acutely aware of his own vulnerability in the face of nature's harsh elements. The cyclist's fears were magnified by the eerie silence that enveloped him, broken only by the occasional sound of his own labored breathing. As he struggled to continue, the thought of a cruel fate awaiting him in the unforgiving terrain weighed heavily on his mind. In that moment, the cyclist realized the harsh reality of his predicament - alone, exposed, and at the mercy of the unforgiving environment.
1063	7043	3	3	"The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many ways. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, ""The sun was beginning to heat down"" (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhausting and made him start dehydrating. Another example is ""traveling through the desert of California in June"" (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of its warmer months. The terrain didn't favor the riders either, ""Flat road had turned into short rolling hills"" (pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a biker's body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider. The harsh conditions of the hot sun, desert landscape, and challenging terrain all contributed to the physical strain and exhaustion experienced by the bike rider during his journey."
1064	7044	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him. As the cyclist pedaled through the scorching desert in the sweltering heat of June, the lack of shade intensified the oppressive conditions. With each passing mile, the relentless sun beat down on him, sapping his energy and leaving him dangerously dehydrated. The dry, dusty landscape offered no respite, and the cyclist's water supply dwindled rapidly, a scarce resource in the unforgiving desert environment. The setting of the desert in the blistering summer sun posed a significant challenge to the cyclist, testing his endurance and resilience in the face of extreme conditions.
1065	7045	3	3	In this paragraph, I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affects the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, and animals, all of which the cyclist cannot control. These factors can have a significant impact on the cyclist while they ride through, influencing their experience and safety on the road. The weather conditions, the condition of the road, and the presence of animals can all pose challenges for the cyclist, requiring them to adapt and navigate these obstacles as they travel. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's journey and experience on the road.
1066	7046	3	3	The features of the setting in this story give the cyclist determination. Since the desert stretches endlessly in all directions, the cyclist feels a sense of isolation and solitude. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, causing the cyclist to sweat profusely and struggle to stay hydrated. The vast expanse of sand dunes and cacti creates a daunting landscape that tests the cyclist's physical and mental endurance. Despite the harsh conditions, the cyclist pushes forward, fueled by a steely resolve to conquer the unforgiving terrain. The relentless heat and harsh environment serve as a catalyst for the cyclist's determination to persevere and overcome all obstacles in the quest to reach the finish line. As the sun begins to set on the horizon, casting a warm glow over the desert, the cyclist's unwavering spirit shines through, propelling them towards their ultimate goal. The setting may be challenging, but it also inspires a sense of resilience and fortitude in the cyclist, driving them to push beyond their limits and emerge victorious in the end.
1067	7047	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldnít have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasnít in a ìghost townî, with the, ìsun beggining to beat downî. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, ìabout forty miles into the petalî, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot. Additionally, the lack of shade and civilization made it challenging for the cyclist to find relief from the scorching sun and intense heat. The deserted nature of the ghost town also meant limited access to resources such as water and shelter, further adding to the cyclist's fatigue and discomfort. Overall, the harsh conditions of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist's experience and made the journey more arduous.
1068	7048	3	3	The features of the setting play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of cyclists. A clear setting is essential to prevent any potential dangers that may arise. Without the right setting, cyclists could be at risk of accidents or other hazards. Therefore, it is imperative to pay close attention to the details of the setting to create a safe environment for cyclists. By ensuring that the setting is appropriate and well-maintained, cyclists can enjoy their rides without having to worry about any potential dangers that may be present. Ultimately, the safety of cyclists heavily relies on the features of the setting in which they are cycling.
1069	7049	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldn't really do anything about them. He started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didn't have much water left and he was only a few miles up the road. A loss of water was very effective in June traveling through a desert. Also, the damage of the road was very effective too because he's on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages, and snakes. The cyclist was on a bike and couldn't really protect himself, and he was dehydrated and tired. The harsh conditions of the setting made it extremely challenging for the cyclist to continue his journey, emphasizing the importance of being prepared and aware of the potential dangers in such environments.
1070	7050	3	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for ìrough road ahead,î adding to the physical challenges he faced. Another obstacle was a mental one. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building, which was both ironic and mentally frustrating. The cyclist must have lost hope in civilization after he found abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging. As the protagonist continues to navigate through these obstacles, his determination and resilience will be put to the test. Will he be able to overcome these challenges and reach his final destination? Only time will tell.
1071	7051	3	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock their water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a place to get something to eat and maybe rest. Additionally, having access to shelter in case of unexpected weather changes would be crucial for their safety and well-being during their journey. Overall, the availability of essential resources and amenities in the setting would significantly impact the cyclist's experience and ability to complete their ride successfully.
1072	7052	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and lack of water, making it difficult to stay hydrated and cool while riding through the desert. The rough road ahead also posed a challenge, causing the cyclist to navigate carefully to avoid any accidents or injuries. The dry air further added to the discomfort, making it harder to breathe and stay focused on the journey. The presence of snakes in the desert also created a sense of danger and unease for the cyclist, forcing them to stay vigilant and cautious at all times. The hilly terrain added to the physical strain, making it even more challenging to pedal through the scorching heat without any relief in sight. Knowing that death was a real possibility in such harsh conditions, the cyclist felt a sense of urgency to find help and escape the unforgiving environment before it was too late. The threat of being consumed by birds only added to the desperation of the situation, highlighting the harsh reality of the cyclist's predicament in the unforgiving desert setting.
1073	7053	3	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist is very hot and thirsty. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of 200. The water was barely even water, so he didnít have much to drink until the next town. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. Flat road is much easier to bike on than hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen on an old Welch's grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envious of the young boy and discourages him. In conclusion, the bad water, the terrain change, the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot make him tired, hot, envious, and generally exhausted.
1074	7054	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesnít have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesnít have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didnít conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didnít get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesnít really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they donít help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.
1075	7055	3	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax all the way back down. The cyclist is facing a challenging situation, with various obstacles hindering his progress. Despite feeling exhausted and fearful, he pushes himself to continue, driven by his determination to conquer the hill. The prospect of a relaxing descent provides him with motivation, offering a glimmer of hope amid the difficulties he faces.
1076	7056	3	3	"After reading, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,"" I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat caused the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the move, he refers to the trip as a ""water-depleting"" one. This quote shows that he was lacking water, and this was a major problem. Additionally, he refers to the road as ""rolling hills,"" indicating that they seem to go on forever, lowering the narrator's hope of getting there quickly. The desert landscape gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally, making the journey even more challenging."
1077	7057	3	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power. The harsh, barren landscape of the desert pushed him to his limits, testing his physical and mental strength in ways he had never experienced before. Despite the challenges, he found a reserve of inner resolve that kept him pedaling forward, one mile at a time, until he finally reached his destination.
1078	7058	3	3	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist, affecting him in various ways. Being in the middle of nowhere with older folks who rarely left their porches made it challenging for him to find the next water source. The warm June weather added to his difficulties, especially since he didn't have much water with him. These factors combined to create a challenging situation for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of being prepared and aware of one's surroundings when embarking on a journey in such remote areas.
1079	7059	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in ìhigh desert of California in June.î This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The harsh conditions of the high desert in June tested the cyclist's endurance and willpower, as he struggled with dehydration, rough terrain, and the daunting task of covering more distance than anticipated. These challenges pushed him to his limits, both physically and mentally, as he fought to overcome the obstacles in his path and reach his destination.
1080	7060	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere, he couldn't get any water. ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,"" he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going. ""The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,"" it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy. The lack of access to water in the desolate setting left the cyclist feeling drained and vulnerable, highlighting the crucial role of environmental factors in determining the cyclist's well-being and ability to continue his journey."
1081	7061	3	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh terrain proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned leaving him no refill. The heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired. On the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting set the conflict and helped achieve the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist. The unforgiving environment intensified the cyclist's struggle, adding a layer of desperation to his already challenging journey.
1082	7062	3	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could pop. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could affect him. The environment plays a crucial role in determining the overall experience of the cyclist, influencing the level of challenge and potential risks involved in the journey.
1083	7063	3	3	"The setting described in the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,"" would be a nightmare for any biker. Riding in the middle of a desert on a summer's day, the intense heat was causing the biker to sweat profusely, leading to dehydration. The deserted landscape was filled with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as abandoned towns and factories passed by. The dangerous conditions posed a significant threat to the biker's safety, with the risk of heatstroke looming. Despite the challenging environment, the biker was fortunate to have survived the treacherous journey."
1084	7064	3	3	The desert area of California was making him dehydrated. The trip was long but he had enough water to get him there only if he took the map's way. The old men who hadn't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office told him a shortcut that he followed and ended up almost killing him due to heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have followed the map, he could have stopped off at a store for more water if the setting was that bad. It is crucial to always be prepared and follow the designated route, especially in harsh environments like the desert, to ensure safety and avoid dangerous situations.
1085	7065	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a bustling city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and, like a foolish youth, followed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He was almost dehydrated, and in an ironic twist, he stumbled upon an abandoned grape juice factory. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: ""Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp - if you want bait for the big ones, we're your best bet."" In the end, he learned to stick to a map instead of old people who ""haven't left the confines of their porches, hence cannot be trusted."""
1086	7066	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advice from people that no longer drive or even leave their porches would be unuseful. When the author says ""old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,"" that's what he is explaining. He then says ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,"" referring back to how he's on the road alone, riding the bike, and there's not a car in sight anywhere around. The curbs of the turns were so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did. ""He wiped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage and tried not to get too excited."" This situation would have made many people excited about the long, lonely cycle by himself."
1087	7067	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous journey. He disregarded the advice of some elderly individuals who warned him about the challenging route, noting that they hadn't left their porches since Carter was in office. Despite their potential wisdom, the cyclist chose to forge ahead, facing the trials of the rugged terrain and unpredictable conditions. In the end, his decision to take the road less traveled led him to a unique and rewarding experience in the heart of the majestic national park.
1088	7068	3	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died. As he pedaled on, the sun beat down relentlessly, sapping what little energy he had left. With each hill he conquered, his muscles screamed in protest, begging for relief. Just when he thought he couldn't go on, a small oasis appeared in the distance. Summoning the last of his strength, he pushed forward, his eyes fixed on the shimmering promise of water and shade. Finally, with a sense of triumph and relief, he reached the oasis, collapsing in the cool shade as he replenished his parched body with the life-saving water. He had survived the desert, a true test of endurance and resilience.
1089	7069	3	3	"The features in the setting in the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" greatly affect the biker. The scorching heat constantly dries him out, while the old water pump in the first town provides water that tastes like ""battery acid."" The posted max speed limit sign also impacts his mood, as he is only able to travel at a fraction of the allowed speed, making him realize that it will be a long journey ahead. Fortunately, he finds pebbles along the road, which he recalls can help ease his thirst by sucking on them. Towards the end of his trip, the bait store offers him the relief he desperately needs. Despite the challenges posed by the harsh setting, the bait store ultimately provides the biker with the necessary support to complete his journey."
1090	7070	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, there were no towns close by. This lack of nearby towns could have posed serious risks for the cyclist. If he ran out of water, there would be no stores nearby to replenish his supply. Additionally, if he were to suffer from heatstroke, there would be no one around to seek help from, potentially putting his life in danger. Ultimately, the remote location of the cyclist had a significant impact on his ability to handle unforeseen circumstances during his journey.
1091	7071	3	3	The hot weather is dehydrating the cyclist, who canít find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey. The lack of hydration is taking a toll on his body, making each pedal harder than the last. The challenging terrain is pushing him to his limits, testing his endurance and strength. The scorching sun beats down on him relentlessly, sapping his energy and leaving him feeling defeated. Despite the obstacles he faces, the cyclist pushes on, determined to reach his destination no matter the cost. The road ahead may be long and difficult, but his willpower and resilience keep him going, one pedal at a time.
1092	7072	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts ìDo not exceed posted speed limit ìis after ìwide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in Juneî. This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. ìa tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.
1093	7073	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie had many obstacles to overcome.

Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he wouldíve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out.

The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is traveling correctly.

When he got to the second town, ""I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This quote means that he wasn't expecting hills; he thought it was going to be a flat way. Also in the 91-degree weather with limited water supply, he couldn't ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. That's how the cyclist was affected by the setting's features. However, despite the challenges posed by the changing terrain and limited resources, the cyclist persevered and continued on his journey, adapting to the new conditions as he went along."
1167	7147	3	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt.

Being mindful of these factors can ensure a safer and more enjoyable cycling experience.
1173	7153	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, and corral that couldnít hold in the lamest mule made the cyclist doubt his route choice. The inability to get water from the pumps added to his obstacles. The presence of tumbleweeds and a large snake made him fearful and cautious. Transitioning from a flat road to rolling hills made the journey exhausting and challenging. The signs he encountered, one warning of a rough road and the other leading him to water, had contrasting effects on his emotions. Overall, the setting presented various challenges and obstacles for the cyclist to navigate through.
1174	7154	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist as he encountered changes in terrain, particularly when the flat stretch transitioned into rolling hills. The rough spot for the cyclist was evident as he pushed through the challenging terrain, as described by the author when he wrote, ""I tolld on"" (Kurmaskie). The cyclist faced difficulties when he came across an abandoned juice factory during his trip, with the narration highlighting, ""over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view"" (Kurmaskie). The words ""long"" and ""crippling"" emphasized the arduous nature of the journey through this rough setting."
1175	7155	3	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who hadn't gone to the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town, it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot, and he was riding through the desert, which made it worse. Because of the heat, he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open, he couldn't get more water.

The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the Welch's grape juice factory. The building-abandoned years earlier-had been a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This desperation, after he had come to the abandoned factory, was followed by disappointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abandoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. The cyclist's journey is significantly impacted by the scarcity of water, leading to feelings of despair and discouragement as he navigates through the abandoned Welch's grape juice factory."
1183	7163	3	3	No water, rough terrain, and bad information are all contributing factors to the boy not doing well in his current situation. Without access to water, he is at risk of dehydration and potentially even heat exhaustion, which could have severe consequences for his health.

As he reaches a fish camp, an elderly man offers directions to Yosemite, but the young cyclist wisely declines, realizing he doesn't need to risk his health by wandering aimlessly in the desert. The encounter serves as a reminder of the importance of trusting one's instincts and being prepared when venturing into harsh environments. Ultimately, the cyclist's decision to prioritize his well-being over blindly following advice leads him to safety and success.
1185	7165	3	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an effect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard time on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an effect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks on us.

This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there weren't many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me"". After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"". Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn't enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced. In conclusion, many factors negatively affected the cyclist's expedition to Yosemite. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey, making it a challenging and arduous experience."
1233	7213	3	3	I belive the setting of an area can affect the mind when put is certin situations. In the reading the man is cycling and he sees no one, he is almost out of water and cant se a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives te feeling of helplessness but if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street and cars he would be calmer he could get water at only building along his ride the tempature would be cold there far he would drink less and go further. This would have changed his mood. In a bustling city setting, with people and buildings around, the man's feelings of isolation and desperation would have been alleviated. The presence of resources and the distraction of activity would have provided him with a sense of security and comfort.
1234	7214	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limits"" has a significant impact on the protagonist, causing psychological distress due to the vast, desolate landscape and the uncertainty of their location. The lack of visible landmarks and dwindling resources, such as water, add to the sense of isolation and helplessness. When the protagonist encounters an abandoned house with only battery acid coming from the pump, it intensifies their feelings of desperation and fear. The harsh environment and unknown surroundings create a sense of unease and confusion, leading to a heightened sense of vulnerability. Ultimately, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the protagonist's emotional state and decisions throughout the story."
1235	7215	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay she was happy that she was getting a shortcut ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a ìshortcutî that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.î He thought he knew where he was going ìI chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, ìthis sight was troublingî. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, ìshe was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was ìonly eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehydrated state. ì The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, ìGary and wilbers fish campî. He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys. The cyclist's journey was a rollercoaster of emotions and challenges, but the impact of the setting on her experience was profound."
1236	7216	3	3	"There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" Another feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage."" Additionally, the cyclist mentioned, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways, making the journey more challenging and demanding."
1237	7217	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the cyclist faced various challenges due to the harsh desert terrain. The scorching heat and lack of shade made him hot and thirsty, causing him to consume more water than usual. As a result, he began running out of water and had to conserve it, leading to dehydration. The disappointment of passing through ghost towns with no access to fresh water added to his struggle. Fortunately, his spirits were lifted when he stumbled upon a small bait shop, where he could rest in the shade and replenish his water supply. This unexpected find renewed his determination to continue his journey to Yosemite National Park."
1238	7218	3	3	The features of the setting made the cyclistís journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Also ther factor was the rough terrain. It  being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a @CAPS1 summer day and he being on a which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey.  To summarize, the challenging setting of the remote area, lack of resources, rough terrain, and harsh weather conditions all contributed to making the cyclist's journey even more difficult and exhausting. The combination of these factors made it a truly grueling experience for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of proper preparation and awareness of one's surroundings when embarking on such adventures.
1239	7219	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Additionally, weather conditions such as strong winds or extreme heat can also impact the cyclist's performance. High winds can slow down the cyclist and make it more difficult to progress, while extreme heat can lead to dehydration and fatigue. Therefore, the setting plays a crucial role in determining the level of challenge faced by the cyclist during the journey.
1240	7220	3	3	He wouldnít know what he would be facing while riding the road. Something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bikeís wheels, or he might fall off the bike. He would get so tired that he canít go any more, he might give up.
1241	7221	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people, creating the best mood for a nice and calm ride. Without cars and just the cyclist and the beautiful sky to ride with, there is a sense of freedom and tranquility that enhances the overall experience. If there were infrastructure present, the cyclist would have to constantly watch for people and cars, pay attention to street signs, and navigate through a more crowded environment. The absence of such distractions allows for a more immersive and enjoyable ride, where the cyclist can fully appreciate the beauty of the surroundings and focus on the simple pleasure of biking.
1242	7222	3	3	In the adventures of the cyclist, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the character and influencing his actions. For instance, the harsh environment of the high desert in California in June poses a significant challenge for the cyclist. As he traverses through this arid landscape, the limited availability of water becomes a pressing issue. Despite his efforts to stay hydrated by drinking from his water bottles regularly, the scorching heat and dry conditions exacerbate the problem of dehydration. The physical strain of cycling combined with the lack of adequate hydration begins to take a toll on the cyclist, leading to feelings of helplessness and desperation. In such dire circumstances, the cyclist is forced to confront his vulnerability and push himself to endure the challenges that the unforgiving setting presents. The setting not only serves as a backdrop for the narrative but also becomes a formidable antagonist that the cyclist must overcome in order to survive and persevere on his journey.
1243	7223	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in various ways. The steep incline of the mountain road made it challenging for the cyclist to pedal uphill, testing their endurance and strength. The winding path also required intense focus and skill to navigate safely, adding an element of risk to the journey. Additionally, the stunning views of the surrounding landscape provided motivation and inspiration, encouraging the cyclist to push through the difficulties and reach the peak. Overall, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, presenting both obstacles and rewards along the way.
1244	7224	3	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldnít get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.íí You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them. Despite the challenges and disappointments faced in the setting, the narrator continues on his journey, showing resilience and determination in the face of adversity.
1245	7225	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the route he was taking had a rough road for him to travel. The cyclist had taken bad advice from some old men who hadn't left their porches for decades. As he continued on his long journey to Yosemite, he began to realize that the advice he had been given was not helpful. The rough terrain and misleading guidance made the cyclist's journey more challenging and frustrating. Despite the obstacles, the cyclist persevered and eventually reached his destination, learning valuable lessons along the way. The setting played a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience and highlighting the importance of careful planning and discerning advice.
1246	7226	3	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got off course, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was running out of water. This was making him dehydrated. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that. When he saw the fish bait shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved. As he entered the shop, the cool air and sight of the water must have felt like a mirage in the desert. Replenishing his water supply and resting for a while, the cyclist was able to regain his strength and continue his journey with a renewed sense of hope and determination.
1247	7227	3	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclistís job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings. Additionally, the weather conditions play a crucial role in determining the difficulty of a cycling route. Riding against strong winds can be challenging and tiresome for cyclists, making it harder for them to maintain their speed and control. On the other hand, favorable weather conditions such as a sunny day with a gentle breeze can make the ride more enjoyable and effortless. Therefore, cyclists must consider the setting and weather conditions before embarking on their journey to ensure a smooth and pleasant ride.
1248	7228	3	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tumbleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there were rough roads ahead of him. As he continued on his journey, he came across a juice factory. No one was there, and he was out of water. He did not know how much longer it would be until he reached another town. The challenging features of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist, creating a sense of isolation and urgency as he navigated through the harsh and deserted landscape, highlighting the importance of preparation and resilience in such unforeseen situations.
1249	7229	3	3	"The features of the setting had a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men, the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they suggested. However, every town he came across was deserted. ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" With no signs of life around, the cyclist's water supply began to dwindle, as there was nowhere to replenish it. Dehydration set in, and he pushed himself to find a source of fresh water. ""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" he struggled on. Spotting some pebbles, he briefly considered sucking on them to alleviate his thirst, but dismissed the idea out of fear of choking. The bleak setting fueled negative thoughts in his mind. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" The hot, deserted desert landscape intensified the cyclist's suffering. If he had not been running out of water, the impact of the setting might not have been as severe. But the scarcity of water made the situation much more dire."
1250	7230	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water and he could dehydrate. Also looking for water slowed him down more. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions, which got him lost and confused. That is how the setting affected the cyclist. Additionally, the rough terrain made it harder for the cyclist to navigate, causing him to expend more energy than anticipated. Overall, the challenging setting presented numerous obstacles for the cyclist to overcome, impacting his journey significantly.
1251	7231	3	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for instinct."" This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him along the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant exercise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't mirage."" This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is Jack London's, ""To Build a Fire,"" where the man is also pitted against extremes of nature through the Yukon, but the elements still overtook him. Both stories represent man's quest for adventure, and also the constant struggle for survival that people face. Experience may be a good substitute for instinct, but sometimes, even the most experienced individuals can be tested beyond their limits by the unforgiving forces of nature."
1252	7232	3	3	The feature of a setting can affect a cyclist's energy levels. In settings with turns, inclines, and hills, it can tire the cyclist out more quickly. The constant changes in terrain require the cyclist to exert more effort to navigate through the twists and turns or up the slopes. This extra physical exertion can lead to a faster depletion of energy reserves, making it more challenging for the cyclist to maintain a steady pace. As a result, cyclists need to be mindful of the topography of their route and adjust their energy output accordingly to ensure they can sustain their performance throughout the ride. By being aware of how the setting can impact their energy levels, cyclists can better prepare themselves for the demands of the terrain and optimize their riding experience.
1253	7233	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist the most by straining him out of his hydrated state, making it impossible for him to operate at his full power and efficiency. The harsh conditions deprived him of the little energy he had left in him, leaving him exhausted and unable to perform at his best.
1254	7234	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says ìand growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.î This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to overheat and live a heat stroke. The lack of shade and water in the desert makes it even more challenging for the cyclist to stay hydrated and cool. The relentless sun beating down on him adds to the intensity of the situation. The physical demands of navigating through the rough terrain further add to his exhaustion and vulnerability to heat-related illnesses. The harsh setting creates a dangerous environment for the cyclist, emphasizing the importance of being prepared and cautious in such conditions.
1255	7235	3	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says ìthe water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sipsî and then it goes on to say, ìI could drop from from a heat stroke.î This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat. As a result, the extreme temperature not only made the cyclist uncomfortable but also posed a serious risk to his health, highlighting the importance of staying hydrated and prepared when facing such challenging conditions.
1256	7236	3	3	The harsh and hot climate, along with the challenging terrain, significantly impacted the cyclist. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, causing him to struggle with dehydration and putting his life at risk. The unforgiving conditions of the setting made it a grueling and dangerous journey for the cyclist, testing his endurance and resilience to the extreme.
1257	7237	3	3	The features of the setting can greatly impact a cyclist's experience. Riding on rough roads requires the right type of bike to handle the terrain effectively. Being aware of potential dangers, such as sharp objects that can cause flat tires or poisonous plants along the route, is essential for a safe journey. In the event of a serious accident, cyclists must be prepared with necessary supplies as they may not be found immediately. Understanding the conditions of the environment, such as cold nights, is crucial for ensuring proper gear is packed to stay warm and comfortable. Being mindful of these factors can make a significant difference in the overall enjoyment and safety of a cycling adventure.
1258	7238	3	3	The desert and hills had a significant impact on the cyclist, especially considering the scorching June heat and the challenging terrain. The warning signs indicating a rough road ahead and the high desert setting added to the cyclist's struggle. The hot weather made the cyclist incredibly thirsty, further intensifying the difficulty of the journey. Overall, the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience on the road.
1259	7239	3	3	"The cyclistís condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat he became exausted, dehydrated and fearing heat stroke and loss of consicencess. This is shown in the essay by, ""the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke"" And, ""It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time. The scorching sun beat down on him relentlessly, intensifying his fatigue and thirst. With each passing moment, his hope of being rescued dwindled as he struggled to stay conscious in the unforgiving desert landscape. As the hours stretched on, his body weakened, and the threat of heatstroke loomed ominously. Despite his best efforts to push forward, the harsh environment continued to take its toll on him, pushing him to the brink of collapse. Lost and alone in the vast expanse of the desert, he faced a desperate battle for survival against the elements."

Traveling to Yosemite National Park on a hot day, he passed by deserted towns, feeling the isolation of the ghostly surroundings. The terrain posed a significant threat as he encountered short, rolling hills that drained his energy and intensified his thirst for water. After covering a grueling distance, he reached a local bait shop where he desperately drank from the sink to replenish his depleted reserves. The harsh environment, lack of water, and challenging terrain nearly cost the cyclist his life."
1261	7241	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the Welches grape factory. The streams were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him realize that he was dehydrated. And last, the abandoned Welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was affecting his mood, making his journey more challenging and testing his endurance.
1262	7242	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story. The scarcity of water in the area poses a serious threat to his well-being, as he only has a few sips left in his water bottles. The deserted and hilly terrain also adds to the challenges he faces, with no buildings or people around for assistance. The changing landscape from flat roads to rolling hills further tests his endurance and determination. The harsh setting increases the cyclist's vulnerability and highlights the importance of being prepared for such challenging environments.
1263	7243	3	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this journey to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. ""A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling."" This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength,"" the features portray sacrifice and bravery of the cyclist. The challenging conditions of the setting added an element of struggle and determination to the cyclist's journey, making it a test of endurance and perseverance."
1264	7244	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry conditions. ""I was traveling the high deserts of California in June."" This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using her own strength to get up and down hills, and to get plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced on as low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time say, before the last world was."" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living. There was nobody around her to help. The setting led to her deteriorating health. Her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy. Her mind was also starting to waver. She had to shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story. Additionally, the harsh weather conditions in the desert made it difficult for her to find shelter and protection from the elements.

So she could possibly pass out without brake, and the hot temperatures. ""When I tried a draper I was, it had the flavor of battery acid"" (Kurmaskie). If she doesn't find water soon, it will affect her condition. Also, the features of the setting affect her determination. When she knows that she needs to find a town, she works harder. ""I would conserve my water go inward for an hour or so at least or my inner spirit"" (Kurmaskie). She would try her hardest to make smart moves and make it to a town as fast as possible. She works harder since she knows without water, her life is in danger. Now, things could get even rougher. The cyclist must push herself even harder to find water and make it to the next town, or she may face serious consequences. Her determination and willpower will be tested as she navigates through the challenging setting, fighting against the odds to survive."

In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, ìtraveling through the high deserts of California in June.î Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.î This setting is a major setback to the cyclistís journey, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best out of it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perseverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey. Like the cyclist, I too had to endure through the unexpected changes in the setting, but with determination and resilience, I was able to overcome the challenges and reach a satisfying conclusion.

Overall, the setting's characteristics create a demanding environment for the cyclist, testing their skills and endurance on the road.
1277	7258	3	3	The rough terrain of the setting made it difficult for the cyclist to travel, especially as the hot sun beat down on him with no relief in sight. With no buildings or people around, he soon ran out of water, leaving him parched and struggling to continue on his journey. Despite the challenges, the determined cyclist pressed on, only to find himself severely dehydrated and on the brink of collapse. The harsh features of the setting ultimately had a significant impact on the cyclist, highlighting the importance of being prepared and cautious when venturing into such unforgiving environments.
1278	7259	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the surroundings are so negative. Everything around the cyclist is perceived negatively, making the task feel harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, with nothing but sand and the hot temperature in an empty setting, the cyclist may feel weak and struggle to continue. If the cyclist were in a park with the sun shining and people around, their attitude would likely improve, making the task feel easier. The environment plays a significant role in shaping the cyclist's perception and experience.
1279	7260	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making it hard for him to control his hill bike down the rough road, leaving him feeling hot and thirsty as he ran out of water. Without any buildings in sight, he had no place to replenish his supply. Furthermore, not knowing where he was going added to his sense of disorientation and frustration. These challenges made his journey more difficult and highlighted the importance of being prepared for unforeseen circumstances when cycling in unfamiliar terrain.
1280	7261	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in many grueling and harsh ways. First, the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling and an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the heat and uphill battles are taking their toll on both the cyclist's physical and mental strength. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming rate due to the scorching and relentless heat. In paragraph four, the exhausted cyclist reaches the first ""town."" This place may have been a thriving settlement, but on that morning, it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. He came across a house with a rusty water pump, which spewed out brackish, near-boiling water that did not support the parched cyclist, physically or mentally."
1281	7262	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they determine the difficulty level of the terrain. For example, a mountainous region will present more challenges with steep inclines and rough paths compared to a flat landscape. Weather conditions, such as strong winds or heavy rain, can also impact the cyclist's ability to navigate the environment safely. In addition, the availability of rest stops, repair shops, and other support services can influence the cyclist's overall experience.

With the directions in mind, he traveled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factories, and hills. With all this being the high deserts of California in June. With all these aspects, the cyclist was worn out and dehydrated saying, ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,"" staving off his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink, he stated, ""I had an overwhelming and buy some bait,"" showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water. The harsh and desolate setting of the high desert in June posed a challenging and dangerous environment for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of being prepared and cautious when embarking on such journeys."
1283	7264	3	3	"In the story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the harsh conditions of the desert affect the cyclist by increasing his need for water resources. The extreme heat and physical exertion cause him to become dehydrated quickly. This is demonstrated when he runs out of water and resorts to trying to drink from an old pump filled with black sludge. The unforgiving environment of the desert plays a significant role in shaping the challenges faced by the cyclist on his journey."
1284	7265	3	3	"While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. ""Telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine."" Among many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. ""Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" As the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found an open store with modern bathrooms, he had ""an overwhelming urge to seek out someone, kiss them, and buy some bait."" In the end, the cyclist promised himself to always use his map, ensuring a more successful journey in the future."

1288	7269	3	3	There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasnít in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.î @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.
1289	7270	3	3	The feature of the setting can have a significant impact on cyclists, leading them to experience illusions and dehydration. For example, the cyclist in this scenario mistook an abandoned juice factory for a working one, showcasing the effects of the surroundings on his perception. Additionally, the sight of rusty pipes further exacerbated his dehydration as he realized they were incapable of producing water. These illusions and physical effects highlight the importance of being aware of one's surroundings while cycling to ensure both mental clarity and physical well-being.

In the story the cyclist takes two old menís advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountain and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. ìI was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.î That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldnít have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see another person again, he gets paranoid because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die.

For example, encountering a steep hill or a rocky path could lead to a serious injury or even a fatal accident. In addition, the weather and availability of water play crucial roles in ensuring the safety of the cyclist. In hot and arid conditions, like those in a desert, dehydration and heatstroke pose significant risks to the cyclist's well-being. Without an adequate supply of water, the cyclist may face dire consequences, such as collapsing from heat exhaustion. Therefore, it is essential for cyclists to be mindful of the setting they are riding in, taking into account the conditions, weather, and water supply to make informed decisions that could ultimately save their lives.
1292	7273	3	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is in an abandoned ghost town, desperately searching for water that tastes like battery acid. The desolate surroundings only serve to deepen his sense of hopelessness. Upon coming across the water pump and the abandoned juice building, his spirits lift slightly, only to be dashed once again. The juice building holds no promise of refreshment, as it contains no juice, and the water from the pump is not only scalding hot but also undrinkable. The bleak setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's emotions as he navigates through the deserted town.
1293	7274	3	3	The features of the setting can greatly affect the cyclist's experience. For example, in the essay, the author mentions how snow can make cycling more challenging.

1299	7280	3	3	"In the story, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" written by the author, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, ""Flat roads were replaced by short, riding hills"" as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and carefree and the land had no hills and was flat. However, once he noticed that everything is not as the men said, he seemed to grow a little angry and upset, like the land seemed to reflect this, as soon he found himself on a bumpy and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on his adventure; ""tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front of me."" The land seemed to be teasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.

1303	7284	3	3	"In this story the cyclist was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained a boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man felt. When he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankful because he no longer had death blazing towards him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and an empty water bottle. This was how the features and setting affected him in many ways."
1304	7285	3	3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts, and no water, a cyclist found himself lost in a town, seeking directions from two old men.

First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hot out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beginning to beat down on him, which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips"" and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June. This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke. The harsh conditions of the desert in June present significant challenges for the cyclist, emphasizing the importance of preparation and awareness of the environment when embarking on a long ride."
1307	7288	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by depleting his water supply, and almost giving him heat exhaustion. In the text, he says: ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" This hotness he has little water left for survival until he runs out. As the sun beats down relentlessly, the scorching heat evaporates any moisture from his body, leaving him feeling parched and drained. With each passing mile, the lack of shade and the unrelenting heat take a toll on his physical endurance. The arid landscape offers no respite, with no signs of civilization or water sources in sight. The cyclist's only hope lies in rationing his remaining water carefully and pushing through the punishing conditions to reach safety."

As the cyclist traversed the desert to reach his destination, he faced challenges due to the hot and humid weather, leading to dehydration and difficulty maintaining balance. Along the way, he encountered a remarkably large snake that obstructed the road, forcing him to navigate past it carefully while struggling with the effects of dehydration. The various elements of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist's journey and added to the obstacles he had to overcome."
1311	7292	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. Some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old man's direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" These factors, the scorching heat, rough terrain, and encountering wildlife, all played a role in shaping the cyclist's journey through the challenging setting."

At first, he is confident that the old men's knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps...with any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat."" The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn't care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best. As the journey continues, the cyclist's mood fluctuates with the changing setting, showing how external factors can impact one's perception and emotions throughout an arduous journey."

1319	7300	3	3	"The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. For instance, if you are hot, a tree could provide shade, or if you are thirsty, a nearby river could quench your thirst. In the case of the cyclist, the environment played a significant role in his journey. He encountered bumpy roads, ""ghost towns,"" and trees along the way. Despite the sun beating down, the cool pines around him provided some relief from the heat. However, the changing terrain and encountering a snake only added to his challenges, making it difficult for him to continue on his path. This demonstrates how the features of the environment can have a direct impact on a person, influencing their experience and ability to cope with the situation."
1320	7301	3	3	The features of the setting, including the dry and hilly land, desert environment, and the scorching heat in the middle of June, greatly impact the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The challenging terrain makes the main character work harder, while the lack of water sources and civilization adds to his struggle. The harsh conditions of the desert setting create a sense of isolation and desperation for the cyclist, highlighting the significance of the setting in shaping his experience.
1321	7302	3	3	"The cyclist in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit"" feels discouraged and dehydrated because of the desolate setting he encounters. Near the beginning of his journey, he is disheartened by the sight of a dilapidated stop with broken buildings and rusted pumps, stating, ""This sight was troubling."" As he continues on his path, he experiences dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds them oozing a tar-like substance followed by blackish water. The cyclist's discomfort is further emphasized by a sign he encounters, warning him not to exceed 55 miles per hour. The bleak surroundings and lack of resources contribute to his feelings of discouragement and physical discomfort as he navigates the challenging terrain."
1322	7303	3	3	"In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, ""The sun was beginning to beat down."" He is starting to get tired because it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Not only is he very tired and hot, but where he is riding is barren and open, and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage, you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cyclist can change how and why he does."
1323	7304	3	3	The setting plays a crucial role in influencing the experience of a cyclist. The features of the environment can greatly impact the cyclist's journey, affecting aspects such as safety, comfort, and overall enjoyment. For example, a setting with smooth, well-maintained roads and designated bike lanes can provide a safer and more pleasant riding experience compared to a setting with rough terrain and heavy traffic. Additionally, factors like weather conditions and scenery can also influence the cyclist's mood and motivation. Therefore, it is evident that the setting has a significant effect on the cyclist and should be taken into consideration when planning cycling routes or adventures.
1324	7305	3	3	The cyclist is overjoyed by the stunning scenery surrounding him. The picturesque views fill him with an immense sense of happiness. His spirits are lifted as he takes in the beauty of his surroundings. The vibrant colors of nature create a sense of serenity and contentment within him. The cyclist feels alive and grateful to be able to experience such breathtaking landscapes. The joy he feels is evident in his beaming smile and carefree attitude. The beauty of the scenery brings him a deep sense of joy and fulfillment, making his cycling experience truly special and memorable.
1325	7306	3	3	In this story, the scorching hot setting of the desert is taking a toll on the cyclist during his trip. With temperatures soaring above 100 degrees, the relentless heat is causing his water supply to warm up rapidly, offering no relief from the sweltering conditions. As he navigates the steep downhill terrain with numerous twists and turns, the intense heat of the desert is pushing him to his limits. The harsh environment is draining his energy and increasing the risk of heatstroke. Every aspect of the desert, from the blazing sun to the arid air, is affecting the cyclist profoundly, making his journey a challenging and potentially dangerous one.
1326	7307	3	3	"The setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in @PERSON1's ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part, until the directions he was given by ""a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office"" takes him over terrain not suitable for biking. Prior to following the men's directions, the setting was enjoyable and made for an easy ride, as the cyclist was confident. However, this confidence begins to deplete as the cycling gets harder, with rolling hills and a warning sign of rough road ahead. Despite feeling disappointed and wanting to give up, the cyclist pushes through and eventually reaches a shop, feeling a sense of satisfaction and renewed confidence. In conclusion, the setting can have a powerful effect on mood and motivation."
1327	7308	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him feel isolated and vulnerable, especially when he rode through that ghost town. The setting plays a crucial role in this story, with vivid descriptions of the cyclist struggling to find water and navigating through tumbleweeds crossing the road. He is constantly thirsty from riding long distances, and the lack of civilization around him adds to his sense of loneliness and desperation. The setting sets the tone for his journey, highlighting the challenges he faces and the harsh conditions he must endure.
1328	7309	3	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is evident in his reactions to what he sees along the way. Initially, he is upbeat and smiling as he sets off on his journey. However, as he encounters the ghost town, his spirits remain high as he laughs at the sight. His confidence in the directions given by the old men also remains steady at this point.   As the day progresses and the temperature rises, he starts to feel the effects of the heat, but it doesn't dampen his mood significantly. When he reaches a fork in the road with rusty water pumps and a rundown car, his confidence in the water level starts to waver, and he becomes more concerned about his supply.   The realization that the next town is far away further diminishes his confidence and increases his worry about water. The transition from a flat road to a rough road also contributes to his declining mood.   Finally, when he arrives at a fishing store and is able to replenish his water supply, his spirits soar once again. The setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's emotional journey throughout his ride.
1329	7310	3	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extremely tired as he pedaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was losing water and energy from his sweat. That's why the features and setting made his journey to Yosemite difficult. Additionally, the steep and winding roads of the mountainous terrain added to his physical exertion, making the journey even more challenging. The lack of shade along the route exposed him to the full force of the sun, leading to further dehydration and fatigue. The rugged landscape also made navigation difficult, causing him to take longer routes and expend more energy. These combined factors made the cyclist's journey to Yosemite a grueling test of endurance and determination.
1330	7311	3	3	"In the short story, ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist faces challenges as he embarks on his journey. With limited water supply, he quickly runs out of water due to the hot and dry weather conditions. The rough roads also contribute to his exhaustion, making the rest of the trip even more difficult. Despite these obstacles, the cyclist perseveres, pushing through the fatigue to reach his destination. The story serves as a reminder of the importance of being prepared and cautious while embarking on any journey, especially in challenging conditions."
1331	7312	3	3	The cool pines and rushing rivers in the setting provided a refreshing and invigorating atmosphere for the cyclist, keeping him cool and energized as he rode through the scenic landscape. The abandoned juice factory stood as a stark reminder of the passage of time, hinting at the inevitable solitude that awaited him. The ghost town, with its deserted streets and empty buildings, painted a picture of desolation and isolation, emphasizing the harsh and unforgiving nature of the environment. These features of the setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's journey, adding depth and complexity to his experience as he navigated through the challenging terrain.
1332	7313	3	3	"The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says, ""Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage"" (Kurmaskie). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist."
1333	7314	3	3	Heat, dessert, and humidity are all factors that impact the cyclist on his journey. The scorching heat leaves him parched, with just a few sips of water remaining in his bottles. The desolate desert landscape offers no respite, with not a soul in sight for miles around. The humidity only adds to the oppressive conditions, making the air thick and stifling. These challenging elements make the cyclist's journey even more grueling and demanding.
1334	7315	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers ìshortcutî as he states that ìthings began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î But what he didnít know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first ìtownî which was a ghost town. He wasnít overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how ìa far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.î A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting. The harsh and unforgiving environment he encountered on his journey pushed him to the brink of physical collapse, highlighting the crucial role that the setting played in shaping his experience as a cyclist.
1335	7316	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. The two old men initially gave him outdated information, leading to him getting lost. The water pump in the first town had water that tasted like battery acid and was extremely hot, exacerbating his dehydration. The small, rolling hills also drained his energy. However, his experience taught him to be cautious about taking advice from elderly individuals who may not be up to date with current information. Ultimately, despite the initial challenges, the cyclist's journey had a positive outcome as he learned valuable lessons and was able to replenish his water supply at Gary and Wilber's fish camp.
1336	7317	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limitî the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, ìNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who havenít left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.î Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. When the old men at the bait and tack shop offer their advice, the cyclist will likely take it with a grain of salt, knowing that relying on their guidance may lead him astray once again.
1337	7318	3	3	The limited carrying capacity in the setting can pose challenges for cyclists. With restrictions on the amount of water and food they can bring, cyclists must carefully plan their supplies to ensure they have enough for the journey. Running out of water or food in remote areas can leave cyclists vulnerable and without essential resources. Additionally, the lack of accommodations in the setting means that cyclists must ride until they find a suitable place to rest, such as a hotel or their own home. These factors make cycling in such settings more demanding and require cyclists to be well-prepared for any situation they may encounter. In conclusion, the features of the setting can significantly impact cyclists and their overall experience on the road.
1338	7319	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. He says ìthe growing realization that I would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.î This means that the heat is a threat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce surroundings. ""a corral that couldnít hold the lamest mule."" He is getting worried because there is no one around, and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the ìoverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.î This means that he is so relieved that he has finally found water, and he wants to thank the owners of the bait shop for providing it."
1339	7320	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn't have to use as much strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the desert had a bad effect on the cyclist because he wasn't able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive effect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist."
1340	7321	3	3	"Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National Park. ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous dayÖ."" The setting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting the cyclist, and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place affects the cyclist very much."
1341	7322	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist is that it is summer time, and it's harder for the cyclist because the heat can lead to dehydration and exhaustion. Cycling in hot weather requires extra hydration and breaks to prevent heat-related illnesses. The intense sun can also cause sunburn and discomfort, making the ride more challenging. Additionally, the summer weather may bring strong winds that can create resistance, making it more difficult for the cyclist to maintain speed and control. Overall, the summer setting presents unique challenges for the cyclist to overcome, requiring careful preparation and adaptation to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride.
1342	7323	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldnít have to worry about dehydration. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened. The environment plays a crucial role in determining the experience of the cyclist, whether it be in terms of accessibility to resources or potential risks. Adaptation to the setting is essential for a successful cycling journey.
1343	7324	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The arid conditions of the California desert cause the cyclist to become tired and dehydrated. For example, the intense heat and lack of water sources along the way make it challenging for the cyclist to maintain their balance and energy levels. As a result, the cyclist struggles to stay hydrated and nourished during their journey through the desert. The harsh environment of the setting directly impacts the cyclist's physical well-being, making it essential for them to find ways to cope with the challenges posed by the desert landscape.
1344	7325	3	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills is wearing him out. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off. The lack of shade and breeze adds to the intensity of the heat, making it even more challenging for the biker to endure the harsh conditions. The combination of the scorching sun, rugged terrain, and absence of natural cooling elements creates a hostile environment that tests the biker's endurance and resilience.
1345	7326	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, ìIt read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, ìsometimes life can feel so cruel.î @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful. The challenges faced in the setting mirror the struggles in life, and although they may be difficult, overcoming them leads to a rewarding outcome.
1346	7327	3	3	The cyclist faced numerous challenges in his journey due to the setting he was in. The road conditions were treacherous, with bad and nasty water posing a risk. Dealing with hazardous obstacles like a large snake on the road made his ride even more perilous. The scorching weather added to his struggles, leading to severe dehydration. Despite the difficulties, he persevered and eventually found respite in a bathroom where he could rehydrate. With the help of a kind stranger, he was able to get the direction he needed to continue his journey. The harsh setting tested his endurance, but his determination kept him going.
1347	7328	3	3	"The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,"" basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because he's alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen."
1348	7329	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. Because there was not a posted speed limit up there, the cyclist went right through and over, going faster than he was supposed to. This lack of regulation led to the cyclist exceeding safe speeds and potentially putting themselves at risk. In environments where rules are not clearly defined, individuals may be more prone to taking unnecessary risks or engaging in dangerous behavior. Therefore, it is essential for proper guidelines and limits to be established in settings where individuals are expected to navigate safely.
1349	7330	3	3	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed are all features in the setting that the cyclist was going through, and they have the greatest effect of all. These elements show the treacherous path he took and the obstacles he had to overcome to prevail. The inclusion of features like poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, absence of life, and lack of water all highlight the harsh conditions the cyclist faced. Without these details, the audience might assume he was traveling through any ordinary trail, possibly passing through developed towns along a river. Therefore, the features in the setting help set the mood and reveal the conflict of the story.
1350	7331	3	3	"When you do something really often, you get used to it. I think the same applies to how sitting affects a cyclist's features. It might make their butt flat or cause their back to take on a different shape. By different shape, I don't mean deformed, but rather that each person's body is unique, so their back may have an ""S"" shape, an ""I"" shape, or a ""D"" shape. This is a natural adaptation that occurs from spending extended periods in a seated position."
1351	7332	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The scorching heat and lack of civilization made the journey more challenging and strenuous for the cyclist, highlighting the significant impact of environmental conditions on his experience."
1352	7333	3	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, as shown by the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side, taking much time and energy, especially for bike riders. The high deserts of California in June indicate heat, making it harder for most people to concentrate and causing individuals to overheat when exerting much force at once. These two factors combined create a challenging environment for pedalists, requiring them to navigate hilly terrain while combating the sweltering heat. Such conditions test the physical endurance and mental resilience of cyclists, making the journey more demanding and rewarding.
1353	7334	3	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So heís keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future. At the end of the day, the cyclist found solace in the freedom of the road and the thrill of conquering challenges along the way. Despite moments of doubt and fear, he pushed through and ultimately realized that with determination and a positive mindset, he could overcome any obstacle that came his way. The ride not only tested his physical abilities but also strengthened his belief in himself and his ability to navigate the uncertainties of the future.
1354	7335	3	3	The vastness of Yosemite National Park presented many challenges for the cyclist in the essay. The summer heat made it difficult for him to keep up his energy as he biked through the deserted landscape. With a limited water supply, he pushed himself to find the next town before he ran out of resources. The abandoned ghost towns along the way added to his struggle, as he faced confusion and uncertainty about where to go next. Despite these obstacles, his determination to keep moving forward drove him from one empty town to the next. The author's surroundings, with their vastness and desolation, created a gripping and challenging backdrop for his journey through Yosemite.
1355	7336	3	3	"In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author vividly describes the setting to illustrate the cyclist's journey. For example, he portrays the hill as ""crippling,"" emphasizing the energy it drains from the cyclist. Additionally, the mention of ""that smoky blues tune 'Summer time'"" highlights the dehydrating effects of the summer heat on the cyclist. These modifying details enhance the reader's understanding of the cyclist's challenging journey. The description of the setting effectively conveys the physical and mental toll of the cyclist's endeavor."
1356	7337	3	3	The cyclist faced challenging terrain that exacerbated his thirst, as he was almost out of water. The hills he encountered drained his energy and increased his need for hydration. When he finally reached the juice factory, his excitement pushed him to exert even more energy, leaving him even thirstier. Despite this, he persevered and managed to make it to the bait shop, relying on his last reserves of energy.
1357	7338	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all, he is in the middle of nowhere, and he doesn't know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn't know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesn't have food or a drink, so without eating or drinking, he can't get energy, and therefore, he can't ride the bike. Additionally, being in an unfamiliar and isolated area can make it difficult for the cyclist to find help or resources. The lack of basic necessities like food and water can also affect his physical health and ability to continue his journey. Overall, the setting presents numerous challenges for the cyclist and impacts his ability to navigate and survive in the environment.
1358	7339	3	3	"The features in the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in the story it said, ""At same point, tumble weed crossed my path."" This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because tumbleweeds are typically found in very hot places. Being in the desert affects the cyclist because he is already low on water, and being in a place as hot as the desert made him even more dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclist is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already dehydrated, and climbing hills made him work harder, causing him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. These environmental challenges made the cyclist's journey even more difficult and dangerous, highlighting the significant impact of the setting on his experience."
1359	7340	3	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered. Additionally, the scorching heat of the sun beating down on him made it even more difficult to continue cycling. The intense heat also caused him to sweat profusely, further depleting his body of much-needed fluids. The combination of dehydration and exhaustion made it nearly impossible for him to pedal on. The harsh environment seemed to conspire against him at every turn, testing his physical and mental endurance to the limit. Despite the overwhelming challenges he faced, the cyclist refused to give up, determined to reach his destination no matter what. In the end, his perseverance and sheer willpower paid off as he finally made it through the grueling journey, emerging victorious against all odds.
1360	7341	3	3	The feature in the setting affected the cyclist a lot. It was a hot summer day, and he was running out of water. With all the heat, he could have had a heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have a lot of energy, and the sun was draining it from him. The challenging terrain made it difficult for him to pedal, and the scorching sun intensified his exhaustion. As he struggled to push through the hills, the lack of water only added to his distress. The harsh conditions tested his endurance and resilience, making it a grueling journey for the cyclist.
1361	7342	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cycles because it was hot and was a rough terrain. The scorching heat made it difficult for plants to thrive, leading to shorter growth cycles and smaller yields. Additionally, the rough terrain made it challenging for farmers to navigate the land, further impacting the agricultural cycles. These environmental factors played a significant role in shaping the patterns of growth and harvest in the region. Overall, the harsh setting influenced the agricultural cycles, making them more unpredictable and challenging for the farmers to manage.
1362	7343	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town, the ground becomes rougher to ride on. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit. That shows that the ground is going to be rough. This rough terrain can slow him down and make the journey more challenging. It requires more effort and skill to navigate through such conditions, impacting the cyclist's overall experience and potentially affecting his speed and endurance. Therefore, the setting plays a significant role in shaping the cyclist's journey and influencing his performance.
1363	7344	3	3	The features of the setting in, ìRough Road Aheadî negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. ìI had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable. ìWhen I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.î Another feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take a toll on his body quickly. ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.î He worried about heatstroke and his body's need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed and was not traveled often by people. ìA ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.î As you can see, the cyclist was negatively affected by the features of the setting in, ìRough Road Ahead.î The harsh conditions of the California desert made the journey a challenging and dangerous one for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of preparation and caution when venturing into such unforgiving environments.
1364	7345	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead your just going to have to be able and to handle the up and downs, bumps. The author was scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean. The treacherous terrain made it difficult for the cyclist to maintain balance and control, causing fear to creep into his mind. The looming threat of danger from the surrounding environment added to the intensity of the situation, making every turn and bump a potential hazard to his safety. The cyclist had to stay alert and focused, navigating the challenging landscape with caution to avoid any potential accidents. The harsh conditions of the setting tested his skills and determination, pushing him to his limits as he fought to survive the unforgiving journey ahead.
1365	7346	3	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushs through and survives. Despite these challenges, the cyclist persevered and managed to overcome each obstacle, demonstrating his resilience and determination to reach his destination.
1366	7347	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cool pines keep the sun from beating down on him and from getting heatstroke. Another way is that the towns he went to had either bad as or no water and he was becoming dehydrated. The heat from the sun was making him feel funny, and he was hoping he wasn't seeing mirages. As he continued his journey, the changing landscape and weather conditions played a crucial role in his well-being and overall experience. The environment around him had a direct impact on his physical health and mental state, highlighting the significance of being aware of one's surroundings while embarking on such challenging adventures.
1367	7348	3	3	The cyclist does not really like the setting of the road. It's messing up big time. The road conditions are poor, with potholes and debris scattered all over. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to maneuver and maintain a steady pace. In addition, the lack of proper lighting makes it dangerous to ride at night. The cyclist feels frustrated and unsafe, wishing for better road maintenance and infrastructure. Overall, the current setting of the road is causing inconvenience and posing risks for the cyclist, leading to a less enjoyable riding experience.
1368	7349	3	3	The setting is a desert in California in June, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. There is no place for the cyclist stop and get more water. He says, ìthere is no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î As you can see that kind of setting would definitely affect the cyclist. With the scorching sun beating down on him and limited water supply, the cyclist faces a challenging and potentially dangerous situation. The lack of civilization around him means he must rely on his own resourcefulness to survive the harsh conditions of the desert. The unforgiving nature of the environment serves as a stark reminder of the importance of preparation and caution when venturing into such isolated areas. In this inhospitable landscape, every decision could mean the difference between life and death for the stranded cyclist.
1369	7350	3	3	Some feature on the setting that @MONTH1 have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strength at first a tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid. Also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change flat road then turned short hills, followed by a snake that looked od a diamond back. As the cyclist continued on his journey, the challenging terrain and strange encounters added to the sense of unease and mystery in the surrounding environment. The unexpected obstacles and unsettling discoveries only heightened the cyclist's determination to navigate through the changing landscape and reach his destination.
1370	7351	3	3	In the essay ìRough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î By Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot. He ran into bumpy roads and hills. For example, he says, ìNot June miles into the next section of the road. He noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.î Another example is, ìWide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.î These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion, this story shows that you should never take directions from an old person, especially if it's hot and you are riding a bike.
1371	7352	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid,î that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey."
1372	7353	3	3	The features of the setting greatly impact the cyclist in this story. Cycling in the scorching hot desert of California in June, the sun beating down relentlessly, the cyclist faces immense challenges. The remote location offers no help or assistance, with the surrounding area resembling a ghost town. Devoid of natural water sources, the cyclist struggles to find water, resorting to a rusted water pump that only oozes out a tar-like substance. Additionally, encountering a poisonous snake on the road poses a threat of being bitten. As the cyclist navigates through hills that demand more energy, exhaustion and thirst intensify. The harsh setting increases the risk of dehydration and exhaustion, highlighting the precarious nature of cycling in such a challenging environment.
1373	7354	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclistís attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump ìblack tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions. The challenging environment of the desolate landscape intensified the cyclist's frustration and doubt, making him question his reliance on the old men's guidance even more. The harsh conditions and lack of resources heightened the tension and added to the cyclist's feelings of anger and unease.
1374	7355	3	3	"The cyclist in ""Rough Road: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" sets out on his journey in the tranquility of an early summer evening, taking heed of advice from seasoned locals. Initially undeterred by the scorching sun and fueled by thoughts of Yosemite, he presses on. However, as the sun beats down and the supposed shortcut proves to be longer than expected, his resolve begins to waver. The harsh high desert terrain of California in June exacerbates his dehydration, intensifying his urgent need for water. Surrounded by a barren landscape devoid of any signs of civilization, he fixates on the distant horizon, promising himself that reaching it will ensure his survival. Just when hope seems lost, an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory looms into view, shattering his expectations. Disheartened, he contemplates his fate but ultimately decides to push forward. As he pedals away from the desolate factory, a fish camp emerges in the distance, reigniting his dwindling spirit. Seeking refuge and replenishment at the camp, he gathers strength and learns a valuable lesson: never blindly trust the advice of others when navigating unfamiliar territory."
1375	7356	3	3	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and nothing around. Being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot. It was dry every where around him so he couldnít stop anywhere and cool off. Also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings. This is how the setting affected him. The challenging conditions of the hot, dry environment made it difficult for the cyclist to find relief or assistance, adding to the physical and mental strain he faced during his journey.
1376	7357	3	3	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one. The gritty texture of the pebble scraped down his throat, causing him to cough and wheeze in discomfort. With each parched breath, the sharp edges of the stone seemed to taunt him, a painful reminder of the unforgiving terrain he was traversing. Despite the adversity, the cyclist pressed on, his determination driving him forward even in the face of such harsh conditions.
1377	7358	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life-threatening situation. The heat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, so he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with. The harsh conditions of the setting are taking a toll on the cyclist's physical endurance, making it challenging for him to continue his journey. As he battles against the elements, the cyclist must find ways to stay hydrated and maintain his energy levels in order to survive the unforgiving environment.
1378	7359	3	3	I think that if we were to enforce stricter punishments on those who speed, there would likely be a decrease in car crashes. Additionally, individuals with severe road rage should be required to attend anger management classes to help prevent dangerous situations on the road. This proactive approach could potentially save lives and make our roads safer for everyone.
1379	7360	3	3	"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he came by. ""But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven't been out for a while. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be a while before he gets any more water. The hills also had an effect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welch's building also had an effect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park. The challenges he faced only grew as he journeyed onwards, highlighting the harsh reality of the terrain and the difficulties of his expedition."
1380	7361	3	3	"The cyclist sees his journey affected by a succession of events that make his travels increasingly difficult. One of the first mistakes he makes is taking advice from people who have no idea where they are. ""I shouldn't have let them have a peek at my map,"" he realizes. The high desert temperature in California also plays a role in his struggles. Despite feeling at times like he might not make it, he also has moments of optimism. ""As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I felt an overwhelming urge to find Gary."" These challenges test his resolve, but he continues on, determined to push through and reach his destination."
1381	7362	3	3	"The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dyhrate who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name got him going in the middle like the start sites on the sreach make right site at the ??.???? the what he steal inside that ""I reached myself riht then that I'd always asked to it????????? find on the last ?? is the bitter. this is said ?? he did not ?? the sight and felt he walking not make, fall on the ?? and get dust stick. Did he ??? want to happen gian so be ?? to always look at the map."
1382	7363	3	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obstacles in the story. For example, he has gone about 10 miles without water. Also, there are a lot of hills and turns within the story which slow him down. He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obstacles he encounters along the way.
1383	7364	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is on a bike ride to a new location. He has a new map and is doing well until he asks some old men for a shortcut. He follows their directions but soon faces challenges like steep hills, speed limits, hot weather, and a lack of water. These obstacles make the journey much harder, and he contemplates giving up. However, he eventually learns the lesson to not take directions from strangers unless prepared for the unexpected. This experience teaches him the importance of being cautious and relying on his own judgment when venturing into unknown territories.
1384	7365	3	3	The features affected the cyclist because of the rough roads. This affected him because it slowed him down, I know this because in the story it said ìRough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limitî. which this means slow down or you will have an accident. Another feature has it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it. I know this because it said ìThe water bottles contained  water a few tantalizing sipsî which means it was few left. Additionally, the rough terrain made it difficult for the cyclist to maintain balance and control, forcing him to focus more on navigating the obstacles. The heat also made him sweat more, leading to dehydration and fatigue. Despite these challenges, the cyclist persevered and continued on his journey, determined to reach his destination.
1385	7366	3	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and heís out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, ìI pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldnít cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.î One thing about his setting that changed was the hills. But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks him if he knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, ìyes- sir: I own a very good map.î By this heís understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because heíll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed. The familiarity of the path and the knowledge of what lies ahead can provide a sense of security and confidence for the cyclist, especially in unfamiliar and challenging terrains like the desert.
1386	7367	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says ìneihbor hood of two hundred degrees.î He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far. The intense heat could potentially lead to dehydration and exhaustion for the cyclist, making his journey more difficult and uncomfortable. Additionally, the scorching sun could also cause sunburn or heatstroke if proper precautions are not taken. These environmental factors play a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience and must be carefully considered as he continues his ride.
1387	7368	3	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to describe the setting like ""flat road"" and ""short, rolling hills."" There were also more examples. The way the cyclist described the setting gave the reader a visual picture. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting. The details provided by the cyclist painted a clear picture of the surroundings, allowing the reader to imagine the terrain and atmosphere the cyclist was experiencing. The setting played a significant role in shaping the cyclist's journey and overall experience."
1388	7369	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story changes based on the main character's emotions. When he arrives in the next town feeling content, the setting is depicted as tranquil. The narrator expresses his happiness by saying, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"" (Kurmaskie). This serene setting mirrors the narrator's positive mood, creating a pleasant atmosphere for the story to unfold."
1389	7370	3	3	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then he came to a rough road. Another obstacle for the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out of the rusted water pump followed by brackish water feeling somewhere around a hundred degrees. Every time he pumped it, it wouldn't cool down, and the water tasted like battery acid. He was hitting his water bottle regularly, which is why he needed new water. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California, and the sun was starting to beat down, so he was dehydrated. The snake blocked the pavement in front of him, looking like a diamondback. As the cyclist faced these challenges on his journey, he had to find a way to overcome them and continue on his path through the unforgiving terrain.
1390	7371	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" The setting is a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California during the early summer. The hot temperatures and physical activity cause the cyclist to sweat a lot and drink a significant amount of water. When the water runs out, it creates a conflict for the cyclist. However, being by a reservoir, fishing is a popular activity and a bait and tackle shop would be present. This setting leads the cyclist to the resolution of the conflict, as he can go inside the bait and tackle shop to quench his thirst. Ultimately, the setting influences the conflict and solution in the story."
1391	7372	3	3	The cyclist's decision to take an old man's shortcut through the desert with minimal water proved to be a challenging and potentially dangerous choice. The scorching sun and lack of shade made the journey much more difficult than anticipated, as he struggled to find water and stay hydrated. If he had stuck to the original, up-to-date map, he could have avoided these hardships and enjoyed a smoother ride to Yosemite National Park. In the end, the cyclist learned the importance of proper preparation and following reliable routes when embarking on a long journey.
1392	7373	3	3	The cyclist had a rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot, and he had no water. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Weeds crossed his path and a ridiculously large snake. There was no one in sight, no buildings, cars, or structures of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water, starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, especially over one long, crippling hill. The setting definitely affected his journey, making it a grueling and challenging experience.
1393	7374	3	3	The weather can significantly impact a cyclist's preparations and choices. In cold weather, a cyclist will opt for heavier clothing, while in hot weather, lighter attire is preferred. Additionally, for longer rides, the cyclist would bring more supplies like water and food, whereas for shorter trips, fewer provisions are necessary. Ultimately, the weather dictates the necessary adjustments and gear a cyclist needs to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride.
1394	7375	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the different aspects of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins, he doesn't even notice how hot it is, saying, ""the sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" His mood quickly changes, and he drinks most of his water, becoming increasingly tired. He finds a water pump which irritates him when he realizes the water tastes like ""battery acid."" As he continues, he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamondback, so he slowly goes by it. When he notices a factory, he uses his last bit of energy to reach it, only to be discouraged when he finds it abandoned. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water."
1395	7376	3	3	Multiple parts of the setting affect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesnít have good water, ìwhen I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acidì (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, ìin my dehydrated stateì (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that affected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him. The various elements of the setting play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experiences and emotions throughout his journey.
1396	7377	3	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the road that he was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to him. Deserts donít have much water which is what he needed and he couldnít find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him. Additionally, the intense heat of the desert caused him to become dehydrated and fatigued quickly, making it even more difficult for him to continue his journey. The vast emptiness of the landscape also made him feel isolated and vulnerable, heightening his sense of danger and discomfort. Overall, the harsh and unforgiving environment of the desert played a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience and emotions throughout his ride.
1397	7378	3	3	The cyclist was exhausted as he was going up hill. The setting of story affects the cyclist a lot. This is because in California it is really good to be cycling. The weather is warm and perfect for a town. It had one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not hold in the lamest mule greeted him. Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at him. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit. As he continued on his journey, the cyclist marveled at the changing landscape around him, from lush valleys to towering mountains in the distance. The sun beat down on his back, but the cool breeze kept him going. Despite his exhaustion, the beauty of California's countryside gave him the motivation to keep pedaling. The cyclist knew that with each hill he conquered, he was one step closer to reaching his destination. And as he finally reached the top of the last hill, he felt a sense of accomplishment wash over him. The setting may have been challenging, but it only made the cyclist's journey more rewarding in the end.
1398	7379	3	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion. As the cyclist pedaled on, the relentless sun beat down on him, exacerbating his already dire situation. The lack of shade and water sources only added to his feelings of desolation and despair. The challenging terrain and harsh conditions continued to wear him down, both physically and mentally. Despite his best efforts to push forward, the unforgiving environment seemed determined to break his spirit. With each passing mile, the cyclist's initial enthusiasm faded, replaced by a sense of defeat and resignation. The setting had indeed proven to be a formidable opponent, testing the cyclist's endurance and resilience in ways he had never imagined.
1399	7380	3	3	"Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclists have many obstacles to overcome while riding. One obstacle would be rough terrain. Cyclists are used to riding on smooth, paved roads, so going off-road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story ""Do Exceed posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, there is another example of an obstacle cyclists have to be careful of, which is running out of water. The cyclist mentioned how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion, when it comes to ""as easy as riding a bike,"" you need to take precautions for what might lie ahead."
1400	7381	3	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert-like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me"" (Kurmaskie). The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death, reminding the cyclist he is alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. If the snake were to poison him, he would be under the scorching sun until another cyclist found him. However, when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber's fish camp, hope is restored. The water he needs to stay alive is nearby, reigniting his determination. In the end, the setting helps him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him."
1401	7382	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, ""not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didn't bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber."" This had an effect on the cyclist because he was now happy to have water and have reached his destination. The challenging terrain, unexpected obstacles, and eventual relief all played a part in shaping the cyclist's journey through the setting."
1402	7383	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw ""short, rolling hills,"" tumbleweeds,"" and ""a ridiculously large shake,"" and he thought that he was not getting anywhere. As he pedaled through the seemingly endless landscape, the undulating terrain of the short, rolling hills made it challenging for him to maintain a steady pace. The sight of tumbleweeds rolling across his path added an element of unpredictability to his journey, causing him to swerve and dodge them as he rode. Additionally, the presence of the ridiculously large shake looming in the distance only served to further disorient the cyclist, making him question whether he was making any progress at all. The combination of these unique features in the setting created a sense of frustration and unease for the cyclist, highlighting the impact that the environment can have on one's perception and experience."
1403	7384	3	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story. The changing landscape and environments act as a mirror to the author's emotions, shifting from courage to despair as he navigates through each new area.
1404	7385	3	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. The rider followed their advice instead of taking the right way he ended up taking the long way. He was getting very thribiy. He also came face to face with a snake. Then he finally found the nearest town and got help. After receiving assistance, the rider was able to continue on his journey with a renewed sense of caution and awareness of the potential dangers that could arise from following incorrect advice.
1405	7386	3	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the hills that the cyclist has to go over and the heat. The heat causes the cyclist to sweat a lot, leading to dehydration. The hills require the cyclist to work harder, causing fatigue to set in. These factors combined make the cycling journey more challenging and exhausting for the cyclist.
1406	7387	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They influenced his confidence, energy levels, and determination throughout his journey. Initially, the cyclist exuded confidence as he embarked on his adventure to Yosemite, stating that the terrain was suited to his abilities. However, as he ran out of water due to the scorching heat, his confidence waned, and he began to fear for his survival. Despite his dwindling energy and resources, the cyclist's determination to reach Yosemite only grew stronger. In the face of adversity, his innate survival instinct kicked in, propelling him forward towards his ultimate goal. The setting played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's mindset and perseverance, highlighting the powerful impact of external factors on one's journey.
1407	7388	3	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example is the old men that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the author's hardest ride ever. Another example is the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in the desert, at that time of year, the heat can be oppressive. In order to beat this heat, you need lots of water, which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned Welch's Grape Juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end, he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved.
1408	7389	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit,"" the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. The sun beating down intensifies the heat, making it harder for the cyclist to ride. As flat road gives way to short, rolling hills, the cyclist faces the challenge of navigating up and down the continuous inclines. Desperation for water drives the cyclist to use all their strength to pump out hot, brackish water from a rusted water pump. These instances demonstrate how the setting directly impacts the cyclist's journey."
1409	7390	3	3	"I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the sharp turns and the loneliness it saw in the text, ""About forty miles into the pedal. I arrived at the first town."" As the cyclist navigated through the sharp turns, they had to be extra cautious and alert, which could have been physically and mentally taxing. Additionally, the sense of loneliness in the setting may have made the cyclist feel isolated and vulnerable, especially when faced with challenges along the way. These factors combined could have influenced the cyclist's overall experience and mindset during the journey."
1410	7391	3	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" The tough terrain and intense heat made his journey extremely challenging. He found himself in the middle of the desert, with no buildings or people in sight, feeling lost and hopeless. As he continued on his journey, he encountered tumbleweeds crossing his path and even a large snake, adding to the sense of danger and isolation. The lack of water and the scorching sun further worsened his situation, with his mind playing tricks on him. The harsh setting played a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience, making his journey a test of endurance and willpower."
1411	7392	3	3	The features the cyclist experienced during his ride had a significant impact on both his body and mind. Starting out on flat ground with plenty of water, he felt confident and fearless. However, as he reached the second town and ran out of water, his optimism waned. Despite telling himself that the next town was only eighteen miles away, the rolling hills that replaced the flat road proved to be a challenge. Dehydration began to take its toll, making each hill feel like an insurmountable obstacle. Sucking on pebbles in desperation to distract himself from the thirst, he pushed on, hoping to reach his destination. Finally, when he arrived, the relief he felt was immense. The journey had tested him in ways he had not anticipated, highlighting the importance of being prepared and resilient in the face of adversity.
1412	7393	3	3	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water along the way, which is bad because the heat, lack of water, and all of his energy exertion leads to major dehydration. All these factors combined make the journey through the California desert a dangerous and challenging feat for any cyclist.
1413	7394	3	3	"The setting of the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit"" greatly affected the cyclist as he rode through a desert in June. The high temperatures posed a serious risk, with the narrator acknowledging, ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" Additionally, the hilly terrain added to the challenges he faced during his journey. These hills, as described by the cyclist, were a significant obstacle that he had to overcome. In conclusion, the setting of the desert with its scorching heat and difficult hills made for a demanding and potentially dangerous ride for the cyclist."

Overall, the setting posed numerous obstacles and dangers that made reaching the destination a demanding task for the cyclist.
1417	7398	3	3	"In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, ""it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldn't refill his water. As a result, the cyclist had to carefully ration the remaining water he had in his supply, knowing that the next inhabited town was miles away. The eerie silence of the ghost towns added to the cyclist's feeling of isolation, making his journey even more challenging. Despite the obstacles he faced, the cyclist pushed on, determined to reach his destination, hoping to find water and civilization before his supply ran out."
1418	7399	3	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they said only ìeighteen miles down the road,î he thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he ìconserved his water ...î and last kept on going, when the road turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply.

It was crucial for the cyclist to stay hydrated and maintain a steady pace to avoid exhaustion and dehydration. Proper planning and precautionary measures were essential to ensure a safe and successful trip through the harsh desert environment.
1420	7401	3	3	Setting in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing  ì a water-depleting @NUM1.î When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like ìbattery acid.î Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now. The harsh conditions of the deserted areas, the lack of water, and the dangerous roadways all contribute to the challenges the cyclist faces. The eerie feeling of being alone in the desert heightens the sense of desperation as he struggles to find water. The abandoned water pumps offer a glimmer of hope, only to disappoint with their undrinkable contents. The setting truly shapes the outcome of the story, emphasizing the importance of obeying speed limits in such unforgiving environments.
1421	7402	3	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced numerous challenges such as limited water, tough terrain, and deserted roads. These difficulties led the cyclist to a point where they contemplated giving up, as expressed in the line ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me down.""

As he arrives at the next town, he discovers an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice Factory, still determined to reach the next town for a drink. The harsh conditions of the setting put the cyclist in a challenging situation, where finding water becomes a crucial and arduous task for survival.
1423	7404	3	3	In the story there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilemma. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is. The combination of the scorching heat and challenging terrain made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult, pushing his physical limits and testing his endurance in the harsh desert environment.
1424	7405	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be a long while before anyone would be able to find him. Nor that might scare some, But I think delved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like you're the only person on the planet. The lack of water, the food that it hasnít rained in decades. The never-ending road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text have a lot to do with the cyclist and affect him a great deal. The challenges of the desert setting push the cyclist to his limits, testing his endurance, determination, and survival skills. The harsh conditions serve as a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of being prepared for whatever may come his way. In the face of such adversity, the cyclist must summon all his strength and resilience to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead.

The abandoned factory he comes across adds to his feelings of hopelessness. If the setting had been different, perhaps he would have encountered people who could have helped him, or found better roads to cycle on. The harsh environment and lack of resources in this setting contribute to his tragic fate, highlighting the importance of the surroundings in shaping the outcome of the story.
1426	7407	3	3	"The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. ""The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I'm sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing."" That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. ""With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author's ""Short, rolling hills"", the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain.

The scorching sun and lack of water can lead to dehydration, as seen when the cyclist struggled to maintain balance in a dehydrated state. Dehydration can not only affect physical abilities but also lead to hallucinations, as the cyclist cautiously checked if a potential building was a mirage. Therefore, being prepared with enough water and being cautious in such challenging settings is crucial for the safety and well-being of cyclists.
1429	7410	3	3	The features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist's journey to the meet town. Not only did the rough terrain make it challenging to navigate, but the rolling hills, snakes, and tumbleweed added to the difficulty. The cyclist mentioned how the terrain kept changing, with hills replacing the flat road. The presence of tumbleweed and a snake blocking the path hindered the cyclist's progress. Running out of water further compounded the challenges faced during the ride. Overall, the setting played a crucial role in affecting the cyclist's performance and made it tough to make it to the meet town.
1430	7411	3	3	The cyclist's journey was greatly influenced by the features of the setting. When he realized that the guy's opinion was leading him astray, he quickly turned to his map for accurate information.

The lack of hydration is likely causing him to become dehydrated, and his condition is worsening. It is crucial for him to find water soon to prevent any further complications or health risks.
1434	7415	3	3	"The features of the settings can greatly impact a cyclist, as demonstrated in the passage ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" While cyclists are typically in good physical shape and able to endure long rides, external factors such as weather conditions and terrain can significantly affect their performance. In the passage, the cyclist's journey was impeded by tumbleweeds crossing his path and encountering a large snake, causing fatigue and exhaustion. Additionally, the lack of water due to only having a few sips left in his bottles further added to his challenges. This highlights how the environment can wear down even the most determined and confident cyclist. Similarly, in personal experiences like playing basketball outdoors, weather conditions like heat and humidity can impact one's ability to perform at their best. Overall, the features of a setting play a crucial role in determining an individual's capabilities and must be taken into consideration when engaging in physical activities."
1435	7416	3	3	During this biker's adventure, the heat and lack of water had a significant impact on him. Feeling lost in the high deserts of California in June, he was exposed to extreme temperatures that made his journey challenging. With only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottles, the cyclist faced the additional threat of dehydration. These harsh conditions tested his endurance and determination as he pushed through the desert landscape.
1436	7417	3	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn’t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can’t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they’re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist. The harsh conditions of the desert play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's fate, emphasizing the importance of preparation and caution in such unforgiving environments.
1437	7418	3	3	"The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she couldnít go as fast, ""The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,"" so that affected her ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water she needed to keep going. For example, ""I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down."" This shows how the setting has got on to her, and she needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist's mind. She believed she was seeing mirages and she was afraid she was going to swallow a stone because she might hit a bump. The desert setting affects the cyclist's ability to function."
1438	7419	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist's emotions. The harsh and desolate landscape, such as the sight of a camp with dirty and unusable water, makes the cyclist feel depressed and hopeless. The feeling of being alone and struggling in such unforgiving surroundings leads the cyclist to question the cruelty of life. However, the setting also plays a positive role in the story when the cyclist comes across a bait shop and is able to quench his thirst. This sudden change in the setting lifts the cyclist's spirits and fills him with a sense of relief and joy, leaving his troubles behind. The varying effects of the setting on the cyclist's emotions highlight the importance of environment in shaping one's experiences and perspectives."
1439	7420	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time. Sometimes he didn't seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" He didn't know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride."
1440	7421	3	3	"The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert. This made him thirsties and less active. The story says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt."" As the sun beat down relentlessly, the cyclist felt his energy waning with each passing mile. The dry desert air seemed to sap the moisture from his body, leaving him parched and exhausted. Despite the limited supply of water in his bottles, he knew he had to ration it carefully to make it through the sweltering day. With every pedal stroke, the heat bore down on him, making his shirt cling uncomfortably to his skin. The relentless sun beat down, casting a harsh glare over the barren landscape. The cyclist pushed on, his determination the only thing keeping him going in the unforgiving desert."
1441	7422	3	3	My point of view is that as a cyclist, it is important for people to recycle their waste. Sometimes, individuals may casually discard items like soda cans without considering the impact on the environment. However, it is crucial for cyclists, and everyone else, to change this behavior. By recycling and reusing materials, we can contribute to creating a better quality world for cyclists and future generations. It is essential for people to save resources and repurpose them to build a more sustainable and eco-friendly environment for all cyclists to enjoy.
1442	7423	3	3	The cyclist, feeling exhausted, regretted listening to the advice of the experienced geogers. As the barren desert landscape passed by, his frustration grew. He berated himself for trusting the guidance of those who seemed stuck in the past. His mood darkened as he pedaled on, realizing that he should have followed his instincts instead. In the end, he vowed to rely on his own judgment and intuition in the future, determined not to make the same mistake again.
1443	7424	3	3	The cyclist faced various challenges in his journey due to the harsh setting. He encountered rusty pumps that only yielded undrinkable water, a large snake blocking his path, and an abandoned grape juice factory when he was desperate for a drink. Despite these obstacles, he persisted with determination and eventually found a fishing supply store where he could rest and quench his thirst. The tough and ironic setting tested his resilience, but he managed to overcome it with a smile on his face.
1444	7425	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his endurance. The amount of time he can ride without stopping, however long he can ride up hill, however many bumps he rides over, however long he can ride without a drink of water. The challenging terrain, such as steep hills and rough roads, can test the cyclist's stamina and determination. Riding uphill requires extra effort and energy, pushing the cyclist to his physical limits. Bumpy roads can be jarring and exhausting, adding strain to his muscles. The lack of access to water can quickly lead to dehydration, affecting his performance and overall well-being. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and highlighting the importance of his endurance in overcoming these obstacles.
1445	7426	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes that occur while riding his bike. He started off with a smile on his face, but as he encountered the bumpy road and the scorching heat, his mood shifted. The lack of directional signals made it difficult for him to navigate, unsure if he was on the right path. Additionally, his flat tire added to his frustration, needing immediate attention. These challenges in the setting tested the cyclist's patience and problem-solving skills, making his journey more arduous than anticipated.
1446	7427	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the roads bumpy and the heat intense. Riding through a desert in June meant enduring scorching temperatures that made the journey challenging. The rough terrain forced the cyclist to exert more effort as he pedaled harder to navigate the uneven surface. Despite the obstacles, the cyclist remained determined to reach Yosemite. Encountering a snake along the way served as a reminder that he was venturing deeper into the desert, highlighting the harsh and unforgiving nature of the environment. Despite these challenges, the cyclist pressed on, fueled by his unwavering determination to reach his destination.
1447	7428	3	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the turmoil in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills, the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a haven, a safe ground that contains everything the man needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow the advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is where the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as “the high deserts of California.” The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessen. When he crosses a snake, it suggests even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.
1448	7429	3	3	The cyclist faced various challenges in the setting as he encountered obstacles like weeds and a large snake on the road. His thirst became a concern, but he found a temporary solution by sucking on pebbles to distract himself. Coming across an abandoned grape juice factory, he realized he needed proper hydration. Luckily, he stumbled upon a fishing camp where he received guidance on his journey. This encounter provided him with security and valuable directions, helping him learn from his earlier mistakes. Ultimately, the features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist's experience, shaping his decisions and leading him towards a safer path.
1449	7430	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist by giving him hope that the finishing line is not far. With nothing in sight - no cars, buildings, or structures of any kind - the open road stretches out before him, promising a clear path to his destination. The vast expanse of the empty road instills a sense of freedom and possibility, urging the cyclist to pedal harder and push himself closer to the end goal. In this desolate yet inviting setting, the cyclist finds motivation and determination to keep going, spurred on by the knowledge that the finish line is within reach. The simplicity and emptiness of the surroundings serve as a blank canvas for the cyclist to paint his journey towards success, with each pedal bringing him one step closer to his triumph. The setting becomes a silent yet powerful companion, guiding him towards his ultimate victory.
1450	7431	3	3	The author was affected in many ways by the conclusion. He was tired from the blazing heat, didnít have much water, and got lost. Water supply was limited, and as he ventured further, things seemed to worsen for him. The man who gave him the wrong directions probably hadnít left his porch in decades, leading the author astray.
1451	7432	3	3	In the story, the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example,ì Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit. Also the dry. As the cyclist continued on the road, the surface became increasingly uneven, with potholes and cracks making it difficult to maintain a steady pace. Signs warning of the rough conditions ahead were scattered along the way, reminding travelers to proceed with caution. Despite the challenges posed by the deteriorating road, the cyclist pressed on, determined to reach their destination. The dry weather only added to the bumpy ride, causing dust to billow up behind the tires and obscure visibility. Despite the obstacles encountered, the cyclist remained focused and resilient, navigating the rough terrain with skill and determination. In the end, the journey may have been tough, but the cyclist emerged stronger and more experienced, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead on the road.
1452	7433	3	3	In the story, the cyclist faced various obstacles on his journey. The old water pump he encountered was dysfunctional, providing terrible-tasting water when it did work. The rough terrain with short rolling hills made his travel challenging. When he finally came across a building, it turned out to be abandoned, adding to his frustration. Fortunately, he eventually reached a town where he could rest and reflect on his journey. Through his experiences, he learned the valuable lesson of not taking advice from strangers.
1453	7434	3	3	The features of the terrain were rough and desert-like, posing a challenge for cyclists. The lack of water and the presence of a battery acid flavor made it even more difficult for them. These harsh conditions had a significant impact on the cyclists, affecting their performance and overall experience.
1454	7435	3	3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficult, he became more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (Kurmaskie). He wasn't going to die, but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office'' (Kurmaskie). He was on a long, hot road, and he started taking stabs at the old men. ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (Kurmaskie). The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back on this trip of only a few rough terrains, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless, angry, and he felt sorry for himself. It is a reminder that sometimes, it's best to trust your own instincts and not rely solely on the advice of others, especially those who may not have relevant experience or knowledge.
1455	7436	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Traveling through the high deserts of California in June, the cyclist faced challenges such as encountering a rusted water pump in a town. Despite his efforts, he only managed to extract a tarlike substance followed by brackish water that was undrinkable. Additionally, the cyclist had been diligently monitoring his water supply, knowing the importance of staying hydrated in the scorching heat. Furthermore, the misleading information from the old-timers about the proximity of towns misled the cyclist, making his journey more arduous. These factors combined to create a tough environment for the cyclist to navigate, highlighting the significant impact of the setting on his experience.
1456	7437	3	3	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad luck. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the high deserts of California in June. That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first town he sees, he can't get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because it's hot, and he's tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advice from old men who have not left their porch because their information may be out of date. The cyclist learns the hard way that sometimes, it's best to trust his own instincts and not rely solely on the advice of others, especially when venturing into unfamiliar territory.
1457	7438	3	3	The old man led the boy down a winding path, surrounded by tall trees and the sound of chirping birds. As they rode further, the sky darkened, and the wind picked up, causing the trees to sway ominously. The boy felt a sense of unease creeping over him, but he pushed it aside, trusting the old man to lead him to safety.  Suddenly, a thick fog descended, obscuring their vision and making it difficult to see more than a few feet ahead. The boy's heart raced as he realized they were lost, with no idea which way to go. Panic began to set in as they continued to ride through the eerie mist, the old man's face grim with worry.  Just as the boy was about to give in to despair, a faint light appeared in the distance. With renewed hope, they rode towards it, the light growing brighter with each passing moment. Finally, they emerged from the fog, finding themselves back on familiar ground, the shortcut behind them.  The boy thanked the old man for his guidance, grateful to have made it through the mysterious shortcut unscathed. As he rode away, he couldn't help but wonder about the strange and magical adventure he had just experienced. And though he may never fully understand what had happened, he knew one thing for certain - he would always remember the day he took the shortcut with the old man.
1458	7439	3	3	The cyclist faced a new challenge as he encountered rolling hills along his journey, replacing the previous flat terrain. These hills tested his endurance further as he navigated down them while already dehydrated and exhausted. The change in the setting added another layer of difficulty for the main character, highlighting the rough road ahead that he must navigate carefully.
1459	7440	3	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains ìthere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it. As the cyclist continues his journey, he must be wary of the challenging terrain and unpredictable wildlife that may cross his path.

Somebody asked him where he was going and tried to stop him, but he still had his map, so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people.
1463	7444	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the cyclist faced challenges due to receiving outdated information from two old men, which led him down a dangerous path.

The cyclist was enjoying himself and the atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the ""collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office"" and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by worry when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber's Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom faucets. This worry was then followed by satisfaction when he ""promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future."" The setting's features, from the initial tranquility to the challenges faced by the cyclist, played a significant role in shaping his experience and decisions throughout the journey."
1468	7450	3	3	"The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. ""I hung my head,"" means that he was depressed. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking at."
1469	7451	3	3	I think the settings made it little more challenging to not letting give up also. Also shows that you do better in life when challenged. This can be seen in various aspects of life, where individuals are often pushed to their limits in order to achieve their goals. When faced with difficult circumstances, people tend to rise to the occasion and demonstrate their true capabilities. Challenges can bring out the best in us, pushing us to work harder and strive for success. It is through overcoming obstacles that we learn and grow, ultimately becoming stronger and more resilient individuals. So, while it may be tough to face challenges head-on, it is often these very challenges that lead to our greatest achievements. In the end, it is the difficult situations that truly test our abilities and show us what we are capable of achieving.

It is always better to err on the side of caution and prioritize personal safety.  In conclusion, the features of the setting play a significant role in shaping a cyclist's experience and safety. By being mindful of the road conditions, equipment, speed limits, and potential risks, cyclists can better navigate their surroundings and enjoy a smoother and more secure ride.

After reading this information and the descriptions, I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn't taken the ""shortcut"" that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author. The challenging conditions must have tested his endurance and determination to keep going in such harsh surroundings."
1474	7456	3	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welchís Factory, and the fish camp.

1485	7467	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through a desert during June, a very hot month. There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or creek for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the effect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cow skull, as in movies. Deserts are intimidating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-terrified head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading."

1513	7495	3	3	The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore itís going to be very hot and heíll need a lot of water to stay hydrated. When he sees that Welchís Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesnít help his dehydration. Thatís why you should always carry a lot of water with you if youíre riding a bike during the summer. The combination of the intense heat, challenging terrain, and lack of water can quickly lead to dehydration and potentially dangerous situations. It is important to stay prepared and hydrated to ensure a safe and enjoyable biking experience.
1514	7496	3	3	The effects of the setting were evident in the intense heat of the summer month of June. The cyclist traversed the rough and worn-out roads, making the journey more challenging.

With each pedal, they inched closer to their destination, fueled by determination and a strong will to persevere. As the hills continued to rise and fall, the cyclist remained focused, knowing that the only way to reach their goal was to keep pushing on, no matter the obstacles in their way.
1516	7498	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is trying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiring. Also, the hot air can dehydrate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dry air, there is dry land, which means there is no place to stop for water or take a break. The rough terrain makes the biking more challenging because it involves more energy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the middle of the road made it hazardous for the biker to go around. If the snake would have bitten him, he could have died from poison. Moreover, the lack of shade along the route exposes the cyclist to direct sunlight, increasing the risk of sunburn and heatstroke. The absence of any nearby civilization or help also adds to the sense of isolation and vulnerability, making the journey even more daunting for the cyclist. These environmental factors significantly impact the cyclist's experience and require him to be extra cautious and prepared while navigating through the challenging terrain.

In the text it says ìFollowed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degreesî this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says ìI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.î This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out.

This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindî. Also it says in the story ìI was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."
1521	7503	3	3	Usually, the features and setting have a significant impact on the cyclist.

Overall, the features and setting play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and helping to convey the difficulties and obstacles they are encountering.
1522	7504	3	3	"The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the ""old timers"" were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardly noticed."" He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees when I tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid."" He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only 2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was ""trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, ""gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth"" just to keep his mind off his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp best bet"" then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."
1523	7505	3	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer.

1524	7506	3	3	A cyclist's speed is dependent on various factors, primarily the weather conditions. On a humid sunny day, the cyclist's lung capacity limits their speed. In contrast, on a warm windy day, they must be cautious to prevent accidents. Safety is always a priority, so speed is adjusted accordingly. Reflectors are essential for nighttime riding to ensure visibility and avoid potential hazards. Ultimately, weather and time of day play crucial roles in determining a cyclist's speed and safety precautions.
1525	7507	3	3	The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid. If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat.
1526	7508	3	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. The long hill is one example, causing him to exert more effort and energy to pedal upwards. The snake he encountered on the dirt road added a sense of danger and urgency to his journey. The scorching heat of the desert made him sweat profusely and drained his energy rapidly. Additionally, his depleting water supply due to the hot weather increased his anxiety and the need to find a water source soon. All these features combined created a challenging and demanding environment for the cyclist, testing his endurance and resilience throughout his journey.

1534	7516	3	3	The cyclist was riding through the harsh, arid terrain of the high deserts of California in June. The dry, lifeless surroundings made his journey almost fatal as the scorching sun beat down on him relentlessly. With his water supply dwindling, he searched the abandoned towns for a source of hydration, but to no avail. The extreme conditions of the desert posed a constant threat of heat stroke, with no respite in sight. The lack of water made it difficult for him to cool off, his sweat drying almost instantly in the blistering heat. The unforgiving landscape stretched on for miles, testing his endurance to its limits. It was a stark reminder of the harsh reality of surviving in such a barren and inhospitable environment.
1535	7517	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The long hills make the journey challenging and exhausting. Each town being far apart adds a sense of isolation and uncertainty. The rough roads constantly test the cyclist's endurance and skill.

1537	7519	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist, with old abandoned towns and hot temperatures creating a sense of hopelessness. The sight of abandoned buildings only adds to this feeling, as the cyclist reflects on the bleakness of the surroundings. However, a surprising discovery of a former Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant brings a moment of joy and hope. The cyclist's mood shifts as they stumble upon a modern bathroom and quench their thirst, feeling a sudden urge to reconnect with their companions.

And with each passing mile, he inched closer to survival, proving to himself that he was stronger than he ever thought possible.
1539	7521	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, ìno one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,î he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to ìshort, rolling hillsî. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed ìcripplingî. My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.  If the temperature had been cooler, the cyclist would have been less likely to become overheated and dehydrated, allowing him to enjoy the ride more. Additionally, if there had been buildings or structures along the way, he could have refilled his water bottles and stayed hydrated. The terrain would have also been less challenging if he was in a different setting, making the hills easier to conquer.

Resorting to drinking from a hot water hole out of sheer necessity, he grimaced at the taste, comparing it to battery acid. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel,"" he lamented as he realized the long road still ahead of him. The contrasting feelings of excitement for the destination and desperation for water created a whirlwind of emotions within him, leaving him grappling with self-pity. With determination, he pushed on, fueled by the hope of reaching the tranquility of Yosemite Park."
1541	7523	3	3	Features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist's moods throughout the journey. After pedaling for forty miles, he arrives at the first town, only to find it deserted, which leaves him feeling frustrated. This feeling intensifies as he continues to encounter more deserted stops and realizes he is running out of water, leading to a sense of desperation. The rough, bumpy road and the sight of a large snake further add to his anxiety and fear. However, his mood takes a positive turn when he finally reaches a bait shop with cool water, bringing a sense of relief. The changing setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's emotional journey, highlighting the importance of external surroundings in influencing one's state of mind.
1542	7524	3	3	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that it's in June in the middle of the desert. Also he was given the wrong supplement, which made him more susceptible to dehydration and heatstroke. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, causing him to sweat profusely and quickly become fatigued. The lack of shade or any source of respite from the intense heat made his journey even more challenging. As he pedaled through the vast expanse of sand and dunes, the unforgiving environment took a toll on his physical and mental strength. Despite his determination, the harsh setting posed a formidable obstacle that tested his endurance to the limit. The combination of the oppressive heat and inadequate hydration ultimately forced him to cut his ride short and seek refuge from the blistering conditions. The setting played a crucial role in shaping his experience, highlighting the importance of preparation and adaptation when facing such extreme environments.
1543	7525	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surroundings. The desert in June was scorching hot with very little water, leaving him dehydrated and miserable. The old men who offered their assistance seemed to have ulterior motives, making him wary of their intentions. With no shops or inhabited buildings in sight, he had no way to replenish his water supply, adding to his sense of isolation and desperation.
1544	7526	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing uncertainty, desperation, and the need to adhere to speed limits. The cyclist faces challenges such as choosing the right direction at a fork, struggling to find water, and navigating a rough road while maintaining a safe speed. These elements create obstacles for the cyclist, highlighting the impact of the setting on their journey.
1545	7527	3	3	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in, has many cacti dotting the landscape, their sharp spines gleaming in the harsh sunlight. The ground is cracked and parched, with no sign of life except for the occasional lizard scurrying across the sand. The heat is oppressive, causing waves to shimmer in the distance as the cyclist pedals on, the only sound the crunch of gravel beneath the tires. Despite the desolation, there is a stark beauty to the scene, with the rugged mountains in the background casting long shadows across the barren land. The cyclist is alone in this vast expanse, a solitary figure battling the elements as they push forward, determined to reach their destination. The unforgiving terrain tests their endurance, but they press on, fueled by the challenge of the journey ahead. As the sun begins to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues, the cyclist knows that they have conquered this harsh landscape, emerging stronger and more resilient on the other side.
1546	7528	3	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they donít get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise. The harsh conditions of the desert not only tested his physical endurance but also challenged his beliefs and perceptions, leading to a newfound understanding of the world around him.
1547	7529	3	3	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity. The scorching sun beating down on him, the endless expanse of sand stretching out before him, and the dry, parched air sucking the moisture from his body all add to the challenge he faces.

The harsh desert conditions, with limited water and monotonous surroundings, made it difficult for him to stay focused and positive. However, despite the challenges, he never gave up, showing great resilience and determination. This experience highlighted the importance of setting personal goals and persevering, even when faced with adversity. It is a valuable lesson on staying committed and focused, even in the face of difficult circumstances.
1549	7531	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, ìI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.""

He said with each passing landmark, ìI eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.î He felt the scorching heat draining his energy, and the lack of water made it harder for him to continue. As the sun beat down relentlessly, his throat grew parched, and his mouth felt like sandpaper. The dry desert air seemed to suck the moisture out of him, leaving him feeling weak and lightheaded. Despite his determination, the harsh conditions of the desert were taking their toll on him. The cyclist knew he had to find water soon to replenish his dehydrated body and continue his journey through the unforgiving landscape."
1550	7532	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. Thatís where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road. Thatís how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist's decision to deviate from his original route ultimately led him to rely on shortcuts, which may have unforeseen consequences and challenges along the way.
1551	7533	3	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, ìNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changingì (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey.
1552	7534	3	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run-down factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is hot and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason his health is at risk. As the cyclist battles doubt and dehydration, the challenging setting continues to test his determination and resilience on his journey to Yosemite.
1553	7535	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The condition of roads can make the journey difficult and bumpy, causing the cyclist to exert more effort. The heat can be unbearable, leading to dehydration and exhaustion. The presence of snakes along the route can be dangerous, posing a threat to the cyclist's safety. The absence of any town in sight can make it challenging to find help or rest stops. Moreover, the lack of information about the terrain and possible hazards can leave the cyclist unprepared for unexpected obstacles. It is crucial for cyclists to be cautious and well-equipped when venturing into unfamiliar settings to avoid potential dangers.
1554	7536	3	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and deserted. The description could suggest loneliness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didnít know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about ìthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,î this thought kept him strong, so he kept trying. The scorching sun beat down on him relentlessly as he trudged through the barren landscape, his only companion the sound of his own footsteps crunching on the parched earth. The vast expanse of sand dunes stretched out before him, seemingly endless in every direction. Despite the overwhelming sense of isolation, memories of past adventures in lush, green forests fueled his determination to keep moving forward. The vision of towering trees and glistening streams in Yosemite beckoned him, providing a glimmer of hope in the midst of his solitude. With each step, he drew closer to his destination, fueled by the promise of new beginnings and the solace of nature's embrace.
1555	7537	3	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and killed him. As the road was not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years, it made cycling much harder for him. The juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot, gross water. These challenges made the journey even more arduous and dangerous for the cyclist.
1556	7538	3	3	"When the cyclist first starts his journey, he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on, he notices everything is abandoned and empty. ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" The man starts becoming very unsure. ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get excited."" He is very doubtful he'd get to where he was going. In the end, he is very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water. The journey that started with confidence and certainty turned into a test of faith and perseverance, only to end with a sense of relief and gratitude for the small blessings found along the way."
1557	7539	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story a lot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions, and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey, the cyclist received bad information on how to get to his destination which led him on a long, hard journey with not much water. He said in the story, ""The speed limit was low. I was doing a water-depleting pace."" This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the setting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse until he reached a highway late in his journey. He said, ""Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy-to-ride terrain was replaced by slower, harder-to-ride terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe fatal and affected the cyclist a lot in this story."
1558	7540	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surroundings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National Park. When he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned, he wasnít so sure if he should keep going. Not seeing anyone or any buildings, he started to worry and was tempted to give up. However, when a second road sign appeared, he felt relieved.
1559	7541	3	3	The setting in this short story causes the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack thereof. The cyclist has no water and thinks it's only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain, which is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there are no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would have been no one there to help. The harsh conditions and isolation intensify the cyclist's sense of impending doom, heightening the tension and uncertainty of his fate.
1560	7542	3	3	"The features of the setting of ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. It makes it difficult for him to bike. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when it says ""tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch's Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned. The challenging terrain, unsettling encounters with wildlife, and the ironic sight of the deserted grape juice factory all contribute to the negative impact on the cyclist's journey."
1561	7543	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, ìI would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water ìa large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruelì. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the ìbattery acidî tasting water. Also there was the Welchís grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. ìA sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my headî. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist.
1562	7544	3	3	"The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. After arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny ""old codgers"" and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn't the least bit established anymore, he's slightly disappointed, but sees it as ""a test of [his] inner spirit."" At the third building, an abandoned factory, he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing. The challenges he encounters in these desolate places only serve to fuel his sense of adventure and determination, turning what could be seen as setbacks into opportunities for growth and self-discovery. This positive attitude and resilience allow him to find joy and excitement even in the most barren of landscapes, showcasing the power of perspective and mindset in the face of adversity."
1563	7545	3	3	The cyclist in the story Rough Road Ahead faces increasingly rough terrain and a sense of loneliness as he pushes the speed limit. The rough road symbolizes the challenges and hardships he encounters in his life journey. Water, which he relies on for survival, becomes contaminated, mirroring the deterioration of his circumstances. Dehydration becomes a pressing concern, highlighting the vulnerability of the cyclist in this harsh environment. His interaction with locals who are out of touch with the realities of the road reflects the disconnect between him and the world around him. As he navigates the treacherous path ahead, he is confronted with the harsh realities of his situation, leading him to a sense of hopelessness.
1564	7546	3	3	The desert is the cruelest of natureís environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desertís heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, ìwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.î If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, ì I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. ìAs this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, ìthe birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gearî. Without adequate water, the desert becomes a deadly trap, where even the toughest individuals can succumb to the harsh conditions. It is vital to respect the desertís power and always be prepared with enough water to survive its unforgiving nature.
1565	7547	3	3	"The features in the setting of the essay ""Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed the Posted Speed limit"" greatly impact the cyclist in a harsh manner. The old man's statement about the towns being present but not functioning adds to the feeling of hopelessness. The scorching California day in June intensifies the difficulty of the journey, making it even more challenging for the cyclist. The unexpected twists and turns further add to the cruelty of the setting. Additionally, the revelation that the speed limit is 55 mph while the cyclist is only able to reach 12 mph due to dehydration heightens the sense of worry and despair. The presence of an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory, with a faded image of a young boy enjoying a refreshing glass of juice, serves as a poignant reminder of lost opportunities and abandoned dreams, further crushing the cyclist's spirit. These elements in the setting work together to create a harsh and unforgiving environment for the cyclist, making the journey ahead even more daunting."
1566	7548	3	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next ìtownî and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welchís factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming ìthe birds will pick me clean,î To the cyclist also was best, then he was ìsavedî by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned. The cyclist's journey through the desolate landscape tested his resilience, but ultimately, he found a glimmer of hope in an unexpected place, reminding him that even in the most desolate of places, there is still a chance for salvation.
1567	7549	3	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game."
1568	7550	3	3	The scorching sun beat down mercilessly on the barren desert landscape, causing rapid dehydration for anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in its unforgiving grip. Phone signals were a rare commodity in this desolate place, leaving one feeling isolated and cut off from the rest of the world.   As the wanderer trudged through the vast expanse of sand and rock, he couldn't help but question his own senses. Was that shimmering oasis in the distance real, or just a cruel mirage taunting him with false hope? The nearest town, the Negg Down, was said to be only a mile down the road, but in the endless sea of dunes, distance seemed to warp and stretch in unpredictable ways.  Every step felt like a battle against the oppressive heat and the relentless sun, threatening to sap the last remnants of strength from his weary body. The harsh landscape tested not only his physical endurance but also his mental resilience, pushing him to the brink of despair.  Despite the challenges and hardships of the desert, the wanderer pressed on, driven by a deep-rooted instinct for survival. In this harsh and unforgiving environment, every decision could mean the difference between life and death. And so, with determination and grit, he braved the desert, hoping to emerge on the other side, stronger and wiser for having faced its brutal trials.
1569	7551	3	3	"The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, ""on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh."" This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. ""growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke"" This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the sun's might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways. The contrast between the joy of the beautiful day and the danger of the scorching sun created a mix of emotions for the cyclist, highlighting the complex impact of the environment on his experience."
1570	7552	3	3	In the setting the conditions were brutal. The author experienced searing heat, dehydration and getting wrong directions. He experienced depression and near death. He had an encounter with a big old snake and last he reached his destination. This affected him and he learned to bring a map and not to take direction from old people. The challenging journey taught him valuable lessons about preparation and not relying solely on others for guidance. The harsh conditions forced him to confront his limitations and adapt to survive. Ultimately, he emerged stronger and more resilient, with a newfound appreciation for the importance of self-reliance and careful planning in the face of adversity.
1571	7553	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it made his ride harder.

Additionally, the presence of hills and roads, including one particularly challenging hill, made the ride more physically demanding and intense. Overall, the harsh conditions of the setting created obstacles that the cyclist had to overcome, impacting his experience on the road.
1572	7554	3	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He saysî i was travelling through the high deserts of California in Juneî. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he canít find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find ìtownsî nearby. Once he finds them, they are either ìghost townsî or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says ìAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snakeÖ blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.î @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way. The harsh conditions of the setting are making his journey difficult and challenging, highlighting the importance of being prepared for all environmental factors when embarking on a cycling adventure.
1573	7555	3	3	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist. Additionally, the strong winds near coastal areas can make it challenging for cyclists to maintain their balance and control. The varying terrains, such as rocky paths or sandy stretches, can also pose obstacles for cyclists, increasing the risk of accidents or injuries. Therefore, cyclists in California need to be well-prepared and cautious when navigating through the diverse landscapes to ensure their safety and enjoyment of their ride.
1574	7556	3	3	In addition to his dwindling water supply, the cyclist also encountered a rusty old pipe with contaminated water. This highlighted the desolation of the town he was passing through, as the neglected infrastructure indicated that it had been abandoned for quite some time. These features underscored the challenges of navigating through harsh conditions with limited resources and no clear sense of direction. The cyclist's journey serves as a testament to the resilience and determination required to overcome such obstacles in the pursuit of his goal.
1575	7557	3	3	The cyclist in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.î had to go through a hard time in the California desert. It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling he had to use more energy and effort to tackle the challenging terrain.
1576	7558	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and made the cyclist even thirstier. Finally, there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet. The combination of these factors made the cyclist's journey even more challenging and intensified his need for hydration.
1577	7559	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist as old people change the definition of adonít talk to strangers, causing the main character to be cautious and wary of interacting with unfamiliar individuals. This shift in societal norms influences the cyclist's behavior, leading them to be more guarded and selective in their interactions while navigating through the changing landscape. The evolving dynamics within the setting compel the main character to adapt their approach and mindset, highlighting the impact of external factors on personal experiences and perspectives. In this way, the setting serves as a catalyst for character development and shapes the cyclist's journey as they navigate through the nuanced environment.
1578	7560	3	3	The features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's experience. Experienced cyclists are familiar with the appropriate speed for biking and do not require explicit instructions. In case of needing directions, they would seek assistance from a gas station rather than approaching a random individual. Additionally, proficient cyclists possess the skill to perform bike tricks without repetitive practice and can determine their rest stops based on personal fatigue levels. Unlike casual riders, dedicated cyclists do not need intensive training to participate in and succeed in competitions; instead, they focus on honing their skills through consistent practice and dedication. The setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's abilities and approach towards biking, highlighting the importance of familiarity and expertise in navigating diverse terrains and challenges.
1579	7561	3	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discouraged. For example, the cyclist observes, ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also, the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then you know that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclist, and now the setting around him affects his journey."
1580	7562	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.î If something were there, he wouldnít feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find something. The lack of any signs of life or civilization in the area only added to his sense of isolation and desperation. The cyclist longed for the sight of a familiar landmark or even just another person to reassure him that he was not completely alone in this desolate landscape. The vast emptiness seemed to stretch on endlessly, making him feel small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Despite his growing unease, the cyclist pushed on, hoping against hope that he would eventually find his way out of this lonely place.
1581	7563	3	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through ìThe high deserts of California in June.î It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could ìdrop from heatstrokeî at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the ìcripplingî hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kindî The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way."
1582	7564	3	3	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out & get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help & nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it. Additionally, extreme heat or cold can exacerbate the effects of dehydration, making it even more dangerous for the cyclist. It is essential to always carry an adequate supply of water and to be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances that may arise during a long bike ride. Proper planning and preparation can make all the difference in ensuring a safe and enjoyable cycling experience.

Being in ìthe california desert in the middle of Juneî does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, Iím sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldnít continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke. The relief of finding a place for shelter and potentially water would have been a great source of comfort after such a difficult journey in the scorching desert heat.
1593	7575	3	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome. As he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says, ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid."" The second drink source he passed was an abandoned @PERSON1’s Juice factory. The text says, ""a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth."" These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."
1594	7576	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly menís directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. Heís also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old menís directions. Heís really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directions and he's beginning to wonder if theyíve lost it. The frustration builds up as he pedals on, feeling the strain of the hilly terrain and the weight of his depleting water supply. But just when he thinks he can't go on any longer, he spots a small stream glistening in the distance. With renewed hope, he makes his way towards it, quenching his thirst and rejuvenating his tired body. The relief washes over him as he realizes that sometimes the best directions are the ones we find when we trust our own instincts.
1595	7577	3	3	There are many different features that can impact a person's journey, such as the weather, road conditions, and the individual's emotional state. The weather plays a significant role in determining if it will rain or if the roads will be difficult to navigate, possibly leading to a flat tire. Additionally, how the person is feeling emotionally can also have a profound effect on their journey. Their mood and mindset can influence how much effort they put into their travels and their overall experience. It is essential to consider these various factors when embarking on a journey to ensure a safe and successful trip.
1596	7578	3	3	According to the essay, the features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's experience. For example, when the cyclist finds themselves in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, they become excessively thirsty as time goes on. The author mentions that they were traveling through the high desert of California in June and had been drinking water regularly. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land, prompting the cyclist to push themselves to reach the next town for water. After struggling over a long hill, they spot a building in the distance, only to find it abandoned upon reaching it. This disappointment adds to the cyclist's physical and mental challenges. However, as they continue on, they come across a bait store, providing a sense of relief as they can finally replenish their water supply. These instances illustrate how the changing setting along the cyclist's journey directly impacts their well-being and emotions.
1597	7579	3	3	"In the essay ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the ëshort cutí that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were really talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going without any water. As he moved forward in his travels he said that the ìFlat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.î Without any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles without seeing anyone or anything. ìThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp. The kind stranger pointed him in the right direction, and the cyclist was finally able to reach Yosemite National Park, relieved and grateful for the help he received along the way."
1598	7580	3	3	"The setting adds a sense of urgency. The cyclist is running out of water and he is in the middle of the desert. If he had been in the forest or the suburbs, it would not be so grave. He talks about passing out and dying. He exclaims, ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die, and the birds were going to pick me clean."" The harsh environment of the desert intensifies the dire situation, emphasizing the cyclist's struggle for survival."
1599	7581	3	3	"In the story, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist found himself concerned about the road ahead. He followed advice that he believed to be correct, only to discover that it led him astray from his intended path. This deviation caused him to veer off course from the destination he was striving to reach. The impact of taking the wrong advice became apparent as the cyclist realized the consequences of not adhering to the proper guidance. This serves as a reminder of the importance of staying on the right track and not allowing misleading advice to derail one's journey. Ultimately, it emphasizes the significance of making wise decisions and staying true to one's goals in order to reach the desired outcome."
1600	7582	3	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucial. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left their porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also, the cyclist has encounters with snakes. Another issue is that the directions were way off, so he had longer to go than he thought. Also, when he arrived from his journey, he found a deserted town. So in conclusion, the cyclist uses his directions from now on, ensuring a safer and more successful journey.
1601	7583	3	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclistís narratorís mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just carefree and has no worries at all. He says that, ìI rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î Even at his first ìghost townî he just ìchuckled, checked my water supply, and moved onî. After this point, he could not be so carefree. After reaching one ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and encountering men, he stated, ìthis was troublingî as it was very hot, and he had been drinking his water quite often. He expressed his fear that he might ""drop from a heatstroke"" due to his decision to trust the old men. His attitude changed greatly as he was afraid he might die. However, his mood brightened when he arrived at the bait shop and got his drink, allowing him to restock and refer to his map. Throughout the story, his attitude underwent significant changes, reflecting the impact of the changing setting on his emotions."
1602	7584	3	3	"In ìRough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist is affected a lot by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump for Yosemite. ìNot two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1.î This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder, how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on. Also, since he is already getting to the point at which he is getting dehydrated, it is that much harder for the already tired cyclist to go on any further more less make it all the way to Yosemite. That is how the terrain affects the cyclist. The cyclist's journey is becoming increasingly challenging as the flat road transforms into rolling hills. The speed limit of 55 becomes more difficult to adhere to, especially as the cyclist's water supply dwindles. With dehydration setting in, the cyclist faces a formidable obstacle in reaching Yosemite. The changing terrain and lack of hydration intensify the struggle for the cyclist, making the road ahead even rougher."
1603	7585	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot. He didnít even no where he was goin. As he continued on his journey, the relentless heat beat down on him, causing him to feel disoriented and desperate for relief. Sucking on the stones provided a temporary distraction from his thirst, but the extreme conditions pushed him to consider drastic measures like swallowing the rocks. In his delirium, he struggled to maintain a clear sense of direction, highlighting the challenging and unforgiving nature of the environment he was navigating.
1604	7586	3	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the towns around the way had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. The harsh environment and lack of resources made the journey even more challenging for the cyclist, highlighting the importance of proper preparation and caution when embarking on such adventures.
1605	7587	3	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways. Dehydration is a significant concern in the desert environment, where water sources are scarce. The intense heat can also lead to dehydration quickly. Additionally, the rough road conditions in the desert can cause mechanical issues with the bike, such as flat tires. It is essential for the cyclist to be well-prepared and equipped for these challenges in order to have a safe and successful journey through the desert.
1606	7588	3	3	The cyclist continued on his journey to Yosemite park, following the directions of the old timers who rarely left their porches. As he rode down the empty streets of the town, dodging snakes along the hard road, he eventually came across an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice Factory. Thirsty and tired, he was relieved to see a sign for Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp, promising the best bait for the big fish.  Desperate for water, he entered the bathroom and drank from the sink, only to be surprised by a young boy drinking juice. Taking advice from a survival tip he had read, he sucked on some pebbles to distract himself from his thirst. As he left the abandoned building behind, a stone got caught in his throat, but he pushed through his troubles and fears, finding solace in the promise of the fish camp ahead. The sign gave him hope and renewed determination to reach his destination, leaving his struggles behind him.
1607	7589	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One feature of the setting was the heat. It affected him by getting him dehydrated. For example the text states,ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heatstroke î This meant the heat was getting to him. Another feature of the setting was the rough terrain. This made it difficult for the cyclist to maintain speed and control. The text mentions, ""My tires struggled to find traction on the loose gravel, slowing my progress."" This shows that the rough terrain was a challenge for the cyclist. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, from battling the heat to navigating the challenging terrain."
1608	7590	3	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after miles to a town then miles passed that he, ""came to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn’t hold in the hamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. ??? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. that bike seen endless. Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel."" him feel his constrain regrate on the journey me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"". Then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. his journey seen hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him his journey seen to be harder and filled with hope as strenght left to finish his goals. As the journey continued, the oppressive heat and lack of resources made each mile feel like an eternity, testing his resolve and pushing him to his limits. Despite the challenges, he pressed on, determined to reach his destination no matter the obstacles that lay ahead."
1609	7591	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed postal speed limit,"" the cyclist is greatly affected by various features of the setting. The people living in the area play a significant role in his journey, as the advice he receives from the old-timers leads him astray and causes him to face challenges such as dehydration. The lack of civilization and assistance in the ghost towns he encounters adds to his struggles, leaving him feeling isolated and desperate for help. The scarcity of water intensifies his physical and mental strain, pushing him to the brink of exhaustion. Despite these obstacles, his determination to reach Yosemite National Park drives him forward, highlighting his resilience in the face of adversity."
1610	7592	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distraught. He sees the sign that says ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limit"" it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him. Also, when the rider says ""In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadistsÖ"" he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing. The harsh and challenging environment of the setting adds to the man's feelings of despair and hopelessness, making his journey even more difficult. This further highlights the contrast between his initial expectations and the harsh reality he now faces. The setting serves as a constant reminder of the man's struggles and adds depth to the overall narrative."
1611	7593	3	3	The cyclist carefully navigated the winding road, his eyes scanning the rough terrain ahead. The sign warning of a rough road and a speed limit reminded him to proceed with caution. As he pedaled on, the rugged landscape seemed to challenge him at every turn. The uneven surface made it difficult to maintain balance, forcing him to adjust his speed accordingly. Despite the obstacles, the cyclist persevered, determined to conquer the challenging road ahead. The setting played a crucial role in shaping his experience, influencing his decisions and actions as he continued his journey.
1612	7594	3	3	The cyclist was struggling in a horrible, nasty environment for cycling. However, what truly threw him off was running out of water. With no houses to refill his bottle and no one around to give him updated directions, the situation became dire. The scorching heat forced him to drink more water, making it harder to breathe in the extreme temperatures. Without these faults, the cyclist would have been fine, but the lack of water became a major obstacle in his journey.
1613	7595	3	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasnít a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relief. Thats how the setting affected was.
1614	7596	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also because he didnít follow his plan on the map he had no clue where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well-being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, that's not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps donít go crazy and they donít really get outdated, and maps don't lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson.
1615	7597	3	3	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniature hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water. The varying terrain made it challenging for the cyclist to maintain a steady pace and conserve energy. Additionally, the lack of hydration further hindered his ability to push through the different types of landscapes. As he continued on his journey, each new obstacle presented a fresh set of challenges that tested his endurance and determination. Despite the difficulties he faced, the cyclist persevered, pushing himself to overcome the obstacles in his path and reach his ultimate goal.
1616	7598	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead"" affected the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals, and rough terrain in order to teach him a lesson about following traveling advice from old men. In the essay, he starts out confidently on his journey after following ""their advice,"" reasoning that the men sounded ""no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town."" The setting changes from cool to dry and barren with the mention of tumbleweeds, and even changed to dangerous with the appearance of a diamondback snake that blocked his path. In the end, the setting changes back to comfortable, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the features of the setting and follow his own map from then on. This experience taught the speaker the importance of relying on his own judgment and not blindly following the advice of others, no matter how well-intentioned they may seem."
1617	7599	3	3	The features of the environmental setting are affecting the cyclist in Lodi, California. The hot temperature is making the cyclist hotter than usual as he heads in the wrong direction, closer to the scorching desert. Running out of water, he is becoming more and more exhausted and dehydrated, even starting to lose consciousness. This poses a major problem as he struggles to maintain his sense of direction and panics with his dwindling water supply. Despite the challenges, the hot setting also boosts his confidence as he breaks down the ride into manageable distances, pushing himself towards the nearest town to replenish his water and survive.
1618	7600	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist was when it got hot, and the rider was running out of water. Another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he mentioned the risk of heatstroke due to following outdated advice. Additionally, the cyclist was impacted when he sought refuge in a bait shop to cool down. Lastly, rehydrating himself in the shop was crucial for his well-being on the journey to Yosemite National Park. The setting played a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experiences and decisions throughout the narrative."
1619	7601	3	3	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. Thats when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasnít tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. Thatís how the setting affected the cyclist.  As the sun beat down relentlessly on the cyclist, the scorching desert offered no respite. With each passing mile, the oppressive heat drained his energy and sapped his strength. Despite his best efforts to conserve his water supply, the relentless thirst gnawed at him, a constant reminder of his precarious situation. The deserted towns mocked him with their empty buildings and dry wells, offering no relief from the punishing sun. The cyclist's only hope was to push forward, driven by the desperate need to find water before it was too late. The unforgiving terrain seemed determined to break him, but the cyclist refused to give up. With each pedal stroke, he pushed himself closer to the brink of exhaustion, his determination the only thing keeping him going. In the end, it was not just the physical challenge of the terrain that tested him, but the mental battle to stay focused and resilient in the face of adversity.
1620	7602	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist's mood in the story as he rode through rough terrain and rolling hills, making him feel like his journey was hopeless. When he arrived at the abandoned Grape Factory, he felt a twist of despair. Thirsty and in need of water, he had hoped to find some at the old factory. When his search proved fruitless, the cyclist's determination waned even further, feeling as though the world was conspiring against him.
1621	7603	3	3	The cyclist was deeply impacted by the endless settings he encountered on his journey. As he followed the directions of the old men, he found himself passing through a deserted town that seemed to stretch on forever. The relentless summer heat began to take its toll on him, leading to dehydration. In a state of delirium, he stumbled upon an abandoned juice factory and hallucinated about drinking refreshing juice. The never-ending landscape and extreme weather conditions caused him to experience vivid illusions, further blurring the line between reality and imagination. The settings he traversed had a profound effect on his physical and mental state, pushing him to the brink of exhaustion.
1622	7604	3	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unbearable for the cyclist. It's just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying “About @NUM2 miles” or “Twenty miles up the road.” All of this hard work can cause heatstroke and kill him. The extreme heat, limited water supply, and long distance pose significant risks to the cyclist as he navigates through the challenging terrain. It is crucial for him to carefully manage his resources and pace himself to avoid potential dangers and ensure a safe journey through the unforgiving desert landscape.
1623	7605	3	3	The features of the setting like the desert, the sun, and abandoned towns affect the cyclist a lot. The dry desert makes him feel as if he were riding forever and probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes him even hotter than he already is, makes him sweat more, and makes him even more thirsty. The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever going to make it to Yosemite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town, but then the rest of the towns are abandoned too, and he starts to run out of water, thinking he is going to die, which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop and finds water. In the end, the cyclist's journey is a rollercoaster of emotions as he battles the elements of the desert and the uncertainty of survival.
1624	7606	3	3	In ìRough Road Aheadî by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California, a time of intense heat in the desert. This extreme weather speeds up dehydration and impairs the cyclist's ability to think clearly. Additionally, the desolate, uninhabited land offers no resources for help, water, food, or shelter. With no buildings, cars, or structures in sight, the cyclist is left completely isolated. The rough terrain of rolling hills further complicates the journey, making it physically demanding and mentally draining. Overall, the harsh setting of the story significantly impacts the cyclist's experience and adds to his challenges.
1625	7607	3	3	"There are a lot of things that affect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads, and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert, so it is very hot. The narration says, ""and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT"" (Kurmaskie). The roads became bumpy, and there were a lot of hills the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either, so he/she was running out of energy, making it even harder. In the end, the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water, overcoming the challenges faced during the journey."
1626	7608	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, ìIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...î(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesnít have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water. The scorching heat of the desert was relentless, draining his energy and leaving him feeling weak and exhausted. The vast expanse of empty desert stretched out before him, offering no relief or signs of civilization. The dry, arid air only intensified his thirst, causing him to become dangerously dehydrated. The harsh conditions of the setting posed a serious threat to the cyclist's well-being, making his journey a challenging and perilous one.
1627	7609	3	3	In ëDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. ìThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,î the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert. This adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, ìwide rings of dried sweat circled my shirtÖ, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in JuneÖî The rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite. The rugged landscape with its steep inclines and rocky paths make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a steady pace, further adding to his struggles. Despite the beautiful scenery surrounding him, the harsh conditions of the desert serve as a reminder of the dangers of not being adequately prepared for such a challenging journey.
1628	7610	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting as he follows the directions given by the old men towards Yosemite. As he pedals on, he runs out of water and becomes extremely fatigued, fearing for his life. However, his luck changes when he stumbles upon a fish camp where he replenishes himself in the bathroom. Upon exiting, he encounters a man sitting on the porch who provides him with further directions, confirming he is on the right path. The cyclist is relieved and grateful for the guidance as he continues his journey towards Yosemite, determined to reach his destination safely.
1629	7611	3	3	There are various effects of being alone on an empty mountain road, with no houses, cars, or people. One positive aspect is the opportunity to exercise in solitude, allowing for relaxation and the enjoyment of the natural surroundings. However, a downside could be the lack of immediate assistance in case of a flat tire or emergency. On the bright side, the absence of vehicles means there is no risk of accidents, enabling a peaceful and stress-free ride. Yet, the absence of water sources necessitates bringing an ample supply for hydration. Therefore, it is essential to be cautious and well-prepared when venturing out alone in such remote locations.
1630	7612	3	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. He knew there was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was there to help him. The environment made him realize the many risks involved in this adventure. The knowledge that there was no help was his motive to continue on his long journey. As he pedaled through the desolate landscape, the sense of isolation only grew stronger. The vast expanse of wilderness surrounding him served as a constant reminder of his solitude. The cyclist pressed on, his determination fueled by the challenge of the unknown. Despite the obstacles and uncertainties ahead, he found solace in the sheer beauty of the untamed nature that enveloped him. With each passing mile, he became more attuned to the rhythm of his surroundings, finding a sense of peace in the solitude. Though the journey ahead was daunting, he knew that the isolation he felt was a small price to pay for the freedom and self-discovery that awaited him at the end of the road.
1631	7613	3	3	The features of the setting intensify the cyclist's feelings of hopelessness as he realizes he is not on a shortcut. The growing heat and lack of water make him fear heatstroke, while the sight of the deserted Welch's Grape Juice Factory deepens his despair. The song playing in his head adds to his deteriorating mental state, leading him to believe his death is inevitable. Even placing pebbles in his mouth seems like a grim option. However, his encounter with a small bait shop restores his hope as he drinks water from the sink. The harsh desert setting, devoid of basic necessities, mirrors the hopelessness felt by the trapped @ORGANIZATION1 members who had to resort to extreme measures for survival. Despite the differing circumstances, both situations highlight how the environment can evoke feelings of helplessness and desperation in individuals.
1632	7614	3	3	"In the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist as he navigates various landmarks on his journey. Initially, seeking guidance from elderly individuals leads to outdated information about shortcuts and routes. This reliance on old knowledge proves to be a hindrance, causing the cyclist to face challenges and detours along the way. Additionally, running out of water further complicates the situation, especially when faced with steep hills that drain his energy. Attempting to replenish his water supply only to encounter hot water further adds to his struggle. Eventually, seeking help from a local store leads to the realization that the elderly man possesses a map of his own, highlighting the cyclist's predicament. Overall, the features of the setting, such as outdated information and limited resources, create obstacles for the cyclist on his journey."
1633	7615	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was very hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day, which took a lot of energy. When he saw the building that he thought could help him, he said, ""... last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill."" This showed that the setting where he was contained a lot of hills, which affected him by using up all his energy."
1634	7616	3	3	"In the short story ""Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist's journey. At the old codger's house, the cyclist is filled with confidence due to the advice given about a shortcut to Yosemite. However, as the setting changes, so does the cyclist's mood. Upon reaching the first town, which turns out to be a ghost town, despair sets in. Despite his initial confidence, the cyclist faces dehydration and desperation as he struggles to find water in the barren landscape. The discovery of a pump that dispenses undrinkable water only adds to his challenges.  As he continues pedaling in search of a town with drinkable water, the setting becomes more and more daunting. Finally, when he stumbles upon a town with access to water, relief washes over him. The setting has a direct impact on the cyclist's emotional state, shifting from confidence to desperation and ultimately to relief as he finds the resources he needs to continue his journey."
1635	7617	3	3	This would be a challenging risk to undertake, but the cyclist is braving it in the desert. The scorching heat of the desert can make a bike ride quite uncomfortable. Moreover, the vast expanse of barren land with nothing but sand, roads, and abandoned factories in sight can quickly lead to a sense of isolation and disorientation. It is easy to feel lost in such a desolate setting.
1636	7618	3	3	The effect of cyclist is very and treding becose alot of thing can go worrs like you can feel so hot have and water wouldnít cool down it didnít matter. But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, turning the air thick and heavy with heat. Sweat poured down his face, stinging his eyes as he struggled to stay hydrated. The water in his bottle was no match for the intense heat, offering little relief. The taste of the liquid was no longer refreshing; it was as if he was drinking battery acid. The danger of heatstroke loomed overhead, a real threat on such a sweltering day. Despite the picturesque surroundings of June, the heat was unforgiving, distorting reality and making even simple tasks a challenge. In such extreme conditions, the risk of dehydration and heat-related illnesses was ever-present, highlighting the importance of staying vigilant and taking precautions in the face of intense heat.
1637	7619	3	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ìThis sight was troublingÖI had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.î With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called ìeasy way out.îAs the cyclist continued on his journey, the challenging terrain and lack of resources continued to wear him down. His initial confidence had now turned into desperation, as he struggled to find a way out of the unforgiving landscape. The harsh conditions served as a stark reminder of the unpredictable and treacherous nature of the world around him, leaving him feeling defeated and uncertain of what the future held. The setting had transformed his once optimistic outlook into one of defeat and resignation, highlighting the powerful impact that external factors can have on an individual's mindset and emotions.
1638	7620	3	3	As the man rode his bike for a while, he felt the sun beginning to beat down on him, but he barely noticed it. The town he rode into seemed like a ghost town, adding to the eerie atmosphere. Despite the challenging weather and the almost empty water bottle, he kept pushing forward, picturing Yosemite's cool pines and rushing rivers in his mind. The combination of physical exhaustion and the unforgiving environment made the journey to Body and Wilbers Fish Camp even more arduous. Yet, the cyclist's determination to reach his destination never wavered.
1639	7621	3	3	Cyclists should be cautious when seeking directions from older individuals, as their guidance may lead to confusion and getting lost. Instead, it is advisable to rely on modern technology such as GPS devices or smartphone apps to ensure accurate navigation. By following these tools, cyclists can reach their destinations efficiently and without the risk of taking a wrong turn. In conclusion, cyclists should avoid taking advice from older individuals and utilize technology for reliable directions on their journeys.
1640	7622	3	3	"The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist, the setting was hot and rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said, ""over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view."" He this means that he needed water so much and the hill was so big that he needed water. Also he says, ""Summertime 'rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain."" It is summer time where he is riding and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song ""summertime"". He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body. Also he says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" He is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see the setting greatly affected the cyclist."
1641	7623	3	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, ìThat I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.î Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.î Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.î Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June.
1642	7624	3	3	"In the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting is utilized to influence the cyclist's mood and reflect his circumstances. The lush, cool surroundings of Yosemite offer the cyclist a sense of hope and comfort amidst his challenging journey. However, as he encounters a dilapidated shed and deserted surroundings, his mood darkens, mirroring his dwindling optimism. The tumbleweed in the desert further accentuates his feelings of isolation and despair. This use of setting to evoke and mirror mood is a common literary technique, as seen in other works such as ""The Heart of Darkness,"" where the desolate landscape symbolizes a character's inner turmoil. In ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting plays a crucial role in the development of the character and adds depth to the narrative."
1643	7625	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay play a crucial role in affecting the cyclist in various ways. The mention of tumbleweeds indicates that the location is likely deserted, adding to the cyclist's feelings of isolation and vulnerability. Additionally, the threat of heatstroke and encountering a large snake highlights the increasing danger the cyclist faces, raising the tension and sense of urgency in the narrative. The significance of the fish bait store's name lies in the cyclist's desperate need for water, providing a sense of relief and hope in an otherwise challenging situation. Overall, these features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's experience, shaping the tone and intensity of the journey.
1644	7626	3	3	The cyclist faced challenges on his journey to Yosemite, including traversing the California deserts. The hot and dry desert terrain made him even thirstier and hotter as he pedaled on his bike. Along the way, he encountered a large snake, possibly a diamondback, which nearly blocked his path. Despite these obstacles, he pushed forward through the rough terrain of the hills with bravery and determination. Ultimately, he overcame these challenges and continued his journey towards Yosemite.
1645	7627	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit,"" the cyclist faced various challenges during his journey. Starting with a smooth ride in the hot weather, he soon encountered hilly terrain that put strain on his legs. As he entered a rough area, he had to navigate carefully to avoid any mishaps. The constant bumps and bounces in the rough terrain likely left him exhausted. Despite the difficulties, the cyclist persevered through the tough conditions. It is uncertain whether he would have made it back to his original destination without enduring the trials of the rough road ahead."
1646	7628	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, ""through the high deserts of California in June."" This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had nowhere to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder. Additionally, the rough terrain and lack of shade can also contribute to the cyclist's fatigue and discomfort. The absence of facilities for refilling water bottles or taking breaks adds to the challenges he faces, potentially putting his health at risk due to dehydration. The combination of these factors creates a more demanding and strenuous journey for the cyclist, testing his endurance and resilience in adverse conditions."
1647	7629	3	3	"One feature that affected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The text states, ""two miles into the section... I noticed the terrain changing."" As the cyclist continued along the route, the rolling hills presented a challenge, requiring more effort to pedal up the inclines and navigate the descents. The undulating landscape added an element of unpredictability to the ride, testing the cyclist's endurance and skill. Despite the difficulties posed by the rolling hills, the cyclist found satisfaction in conquering each rise and enjoying the exhilarating descents that followed. The changing terrain provided a sense of adventure and accomplishment, making the ride a memorable and fulfilling experience."
1648	7630	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the challenges faced by the cyclist. Taking place in the scorching summer heat of the western desert, the already warm climate intensifies the difficulty of the journey. Additionally, the lack of civilization along the shortcut means that the author has no access to water to replenish his dehydrated body. These setting features combine to create a harsh and unforgiving environment for the cyclist, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the posted speed limit to ensure safety and survival on the treacherous road ahead."
1649	7631	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because is it was windy too it would be hard for the cyclist to control the bike. So if there are a lot of buildings and people outside, there would be a lot of traffic, and the cyclist would not be allowed to go there, so they would have to turn back. However, if it was a clear road with no buildings or houses, then it would be an easy ride for the cyclist. As you can see, the setting affects the cyclist in many ways, making their ride either difficult or smooth depending on the conditions.
1650	7632	3	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct. As he pedaled through the unforgiving heat, his energy dwindled, and his frustration grew. However, upon finally arriving at his destination, relief and gratitude flooded over him. The challenging setting had tested him, but he emerged stronger and more appreciative in the end.
1651	7633	3	3	If itís a good day the cyclist will want to ride. If it is a bad day then they will not want to but probably will. The weather also plays a significant role in the cyclist's decision to ride. A sunny day with clear skies is more likely to motivate them to get on their bike, while rainy or stormy weather may deter them. Additionally, the cyclist's physical and mental state can impact their desire to ride. If they are feeling energetic and positive, they will be more inclined to go for a ride. Conversely, if they are tired or stressed, they may not feel up to it but might still push themselves to do so. Ultimately, the love for cycling and the benefits it brings often outweigh any obstacles or excuses, prompting the cyclist to hit the road regardless of the circumstances.
1652	7634	3	3	In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, features of the setting affect the cyclist because there are old people who have been around for a long time. These elderly individuals are not reliable sources of information as they have not ventured outside their porches since the Carter administration. As a result, seeking advice from them would not be beneficial for the solo cyclist. It is important for cyclists to be cautious and discerning when taking advice from individuals who may not have up-to-date or relevant knowledge. By being selective in who they seek guidance from, cyclists can ensure a safe and successful journey.
1653	7635	3	3	The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind líD war a be in at forts. I thought it was going to be a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who havenít left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike pedaling through the California desert with the things you can carry cause you're on a bike. He ran out of water and could have got heatstroke or collapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirsty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in hormone and I don't think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut. The harsh reality of being unprepared for the challenges of cycling in extreme conditions can lead to dire consequences, highlighting the importance of proper planning and readiness for any situation.
1654	7636	3	3	In the story, the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings, he had no water, and was lost had a negative effect on the cyclist. He was doubting himself the whole time as he struggled to find his way out of the deserted area. Despite the challenges he faced, he persevered and eventually made it through the tough situation he was in. The lack of resources and support only added to his feelings of isolation and desperation, but he refused to give up. In the end, his determination and resilience paid off, and he was able to overcome the obstacles in his path.
1655	7637	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead,"" the setting and features greatly impact the cyclist. For instance, the protagonist mentions, ""Iíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate."" This indicates the harsh conditions, as extreme thirst would only arise in hot weather. The narrative unfolds in California on a scorching day. Another line supporting this is, ""I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirage,"" highlighting the intense heat causing profuse sweating. The mention of a mirage suggests a desert-like environment, typically associated with high temperatures. These elements of the setting directly influence the cyclist's struggles, adding to the challenging journey ahead."
1656	7638	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's journey. Initially, the vast expanse of nothingness stretched before the cyclist, dampening his determination. However, as he pedaled on, a building came into view, providing a beacon of hope and renewing his strength. The sight of this structure injected a sense of relief and confidence into the cyclist, revitalizing his resolve to push forward towards his ultimate goal. The features of the setting, from desolate landscapes to comforting landmarks, significantly impacted the cyclist's mindset and motivation throughout his arduous journey."
1657	7639	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy. ""I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" illustrating the dehydration of the rider. ""The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke,"" indicates that the time and energy of the rider are running out. These ideas and quotes highlight the impact of the setting on the cyclist, emphasizing the urgency and challenges he faces in the harsh environment."
1658	7640	3	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didnít turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to ìset inî. The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated. The dry, dusty trail stretched out endlessly before him, with no shade in sight to offer respite from the relentless sun. The author's throat was parched, and every breath felt like inhaling hot, dry air. His skin prickled with the heat, and sweat poured down his face and back, evaporating almost instantly in the arid atmosphere. As the hours passed, the author's head began to throb with a growing headache, a sure sign of dehydration. With each passing mile, the struggle against the elements became more intense, pushing the author to his limits. The combination of physical exertion, lack of water, and scorching heat created a dangerous situation, one that required all of the author's strength and determination to overcome.
1659	7641	3	3	The cyclist encountered various challenges on his journey, with the setting playing a significant role in affecting his experiences. He struggled with unreliable directions from locals, a lack of water, rough terrain, and the presence of snakes. The desolate surroundings, devoid of buildings and cars, added to his sense of isolation and helplessness. However, his mood and determination were lifted when he stumbled upon an abandoned factory that offered him much-needed water and a sense of human presence. Despite the hardships faced, he persevered through the obstacles, showcasing his resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity.
1660	7642	3	3	The setting in ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limitî has a significant impact on the main character in the story. As he journeys through the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite, his confidence is boosted by the inspiring surroundings. However, as the terrain begins to change and he encounters rolling hills, doubt starts to creep in. The desolation of the landscape, with no signs of life in sight, deepens his sense of despair. When he finally spots a building after conquering a long, exhausting hill, relief floods over him. The setting plays a crucial role in shaping the main character's emotional journey, from hope to uncertainty to eventual triumph.
1661	7643	3	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can't go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him. The challenging terrain and unexpected encounters along the way test his endurance and determination, pushing him to his limits. Ultimately, these obstacles shape his journey and make reaching his destination all the more rewarding.
1662	7644	3	3	The cyclist was begging to feel that death was coming his way as he continued without a building in sight. This made him grow hysterical over the situation, and still have enough energy to feel sorry for himself. Then when he finally did see a building he thought it was a mirage. His heart raced as he pedaled towards it, unsure if it was real or just a figment of his delirious mind. As he got closer, the outline of the building became clearer, and he realized it was indeed a solid structure. Relief washed over him, knowing that he would soon find shelter and safety. The cyclist pushed himself harder, fueled by the hope of reaching the building and escaping the desolate landscape. Finally, he arrived at the entrance, grateful for this unexpected oasis in the midst of his ordeal.
1663	7645	3	3	The location of a cyclistís ride affects the personís attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes ìIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.î This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst. The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked ìbrackish.î So, setting can break a cyclist.
1664	7646	3	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. He's running low on water, he's almost dehydrated, and the weather where he's at is very hot. He can't see a town for miles, and there is no shade in sight. The scorching sun beats down on him mercilessly, making each pedal stroke feel like an uphill battle. The landscape is barren, with no signs of life around. The only sound he can hear is the dry, dusty wind whistling past his ears. The lack of water is starting to take its toll on his body, and he can feel his energy waning with each passing mile. The situation is becoming dire, and he knows he needs to find help soon before it's too late.
1665	7647	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water, and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated. He also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go. He took a ìshortcutî but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated. This is how the setting affected him. The lack of water combined with the scorching heat made the cyclist's journey even more challenging, causing him to struggle with dehydration and exhaustion. The rugged terrain added to his difficulties, prolonging his trip and pushing him to his physical limits. Ultimately, the harsh setting posed significant obstacles for the cyclist to overcome, highlighting the impact of environmental factors on his experience.
1666	7648	3	3	The cyclist benefits from the setting in various ways. The physical demands of cycling keep him in good shape, contributing to his overall health and fitness. Additionally, participating in cycling contests offers the opportunity to win prizes and potentially earn a substantial amount of money. These positive aspects of the setting enhance the cyclist's well-being and success in the sport.
1667	7649	3	3	"In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, many obstacles are caused by different settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This led to a loss of determination, which ultimately resulted in him losing consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also affected him, causing him to become tired and weak, further diminishing his determination. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually lead to him losing consciousness. He mentioned, ""if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time."" These challenges in the environment created physical and mental hurdles for the character, making his journey even more challenging."
1668	7650	3	3	The setting of the story had a significant impact on the protagonist's journey, particularly in terms of the challenges he faced in finding water. In a suburban environment, he could have easily stopped at various points to replenish his water supply. However, being situated in the middle of a desert, he was forced to keep rolling in the hope of coming across a water source. For instance, he had to cover a long distance of 10 miles to reach the next town where he could access water. If he had been in a different setting without desert terrain and hills, he would have been able to reach his destination much quicker. The harsh desert setting added a layer of difficulty to his journey, making the quest for water a critical and challenging aspect of his cycle ride.
1669	7651	3	3	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. The flat road soon became bumpy hills, which were made harder to cycle because of lack of water. The hot desert sun and lack of towns and people also made the journey difficult. As the cyclist pedaled through the challenging terrain, the intense heat sapped their energy, and the absence of civilization left them feeling isolated and vulnerable. The unforgiving landscape tested their endurance and determination, creating a grueling experience that pushed them to their limits. Despite these hardships, the cyclist pressed on, fueled by the hope of reaching their destination and the satisfaction of conquering such a formidable environment.
1670	7652	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is too hot, making his water taste like battery acid. Additionally, he has to navigate difficult trails with directions from old-timers who haven't left their porches in years. The relentless heat, combined with nonstop cycling, only adds to his discomfort. However, thoughts of the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite provide a much-needed distraction from the oppressive heat. The setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience, both challenging and inspiring him as he continues on his journey.
1671	7653	3	3	"There are many reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The scorching heat of the California desert during summertime can be particularly challenging for anyone out on the road. Additionally, the rough terrain indicated by the warning sign of a ""Rough Road Ahead"" poses a significant obstacle for the cyclist to navigate through. Furthermore, the lack of people around means there is no one to ask for directions or offer a much-needed drink of water. These factors combined make it difficult for the cyclist to endure the harsh conditions and successfully reach their destination."
1672	7654	3	3	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, ìÖ I maneuvered down the hill.î You also know that she starts of around no good water. ìWhen I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acidÖî that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says ìÖin the middle of two hundred degrees.î Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemiteís biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid.
1673	7655	3	3	"There are many things that could affect the cyclist. Like when they said, ""tumbleweeds crossed my path as a ridiculously large snake."" An example would be when they said, ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."
1674	7656	3	3	The cyclist found themselves facing various challenges as they rode through the setting with a speed limit of 30 mph. Despite the water-depleting heat, they persevered, feeling the cruelty of life at times. However, the cyclist's love for riding their bike kept them going, especially as they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening. Through it all, they pushed forward, determined to overcome the obstacles in their path and revel in the joy that cycling brought them.
1675	7657	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees ìThe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"". Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. ìFlat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said ìrough road aheadî The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. ìthe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips.î Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or ìghost townî. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park. The challenging terrain, dwindling water supply, and lack of resources in deserted towns all presented obstacles for the determined cyclist on his journey to Yosemite National Park."
1676	7658	3	3	The older men gave him directions that were actually really bad. Nature wasn't on his side, that's for sure. First of all, he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly, a snake blocked his path, and he didn't want to tempt it. Thirdly, he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also, he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone he relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat. He was then led to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere, and he had no way of getting home. As he stood there, stranded and helpless, he realized the gravity of his situation and the importance of being prepared for any outdoor adventure.
1677	7659	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because there was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bear had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and there was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" If the cyclist had needed help then the cyclist could most likely have died. If I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I'm glad the cyclist didn't. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happen to him. The harsh environment presented numerous challenges that could have been life-threatening for the cyclist, making the journey extremely perilous and demanding."
1678	7660	3	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, ìThat you should never accept travel advice from old timers that havenít left their porches since Carter was in officeî. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who havenít left their homes in years.
1679	7661	3	3	"The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert no one around, hot, dry, no water, and no shade. ""Tumbleweeds crossed my path"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This described his loneliness because no one was in the desert to help him. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp. The setting had a huge affected on the author. The harsh conditions of the desert made survival challenging, and the lack of water and resources intensified the author's isolation and vulnerability. The presence of tumbleweeds symbolized his solitude in the vast, unforgiving landscape. Fortunately, the discovery of the fish camp provided a lifeline in the midst of the desert, offering a glimmer of hope and salvation. The contrast between the desolate desert and the oasis of the fish camp underscored the profound impact of the setting on the author's journey."
1680	7662	3	3	"The feature in the short story affects the cyclist because with no towns around, there is no water. In the story, it says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up and down hills made it harder and hotter. The heat could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, ""and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" The buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually, he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, ""I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink."" This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally."
1681	7663	3	3	"In ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî, the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclistís physical state, but his mood and determination as well. As the cyclist pushed through the challenging terrain, he realized the importance of being prepared for unexpected changes and the value of perseverance in overcoming obstacles. The journey to Yosemite National Park was indeed a rough road ahead, but with determination and resilience, he knew he could conquer whatever lay ahead."
1682	7664	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The journey was meant to be a simple one, as the man on the porch had assured him it wouldn't be too far. However, as he pedaled on, the surroundings seemed to transform into an unfamiliar and desolate landscape.

1683	7665	3	3	"The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many different ways. Because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state. ""The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so."" The rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy. Because there were no buildings for miles, he broke the ride into short distances. This lack of civilization along the road added an extra challenge to his journey, forcing him to carefully plan his water consumption and energy output to ensure he could make it to the next town safely."
1684	7666	3	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist's journey. The lack of water posed a significant challenge, causing him distress and fatigue. The directions given by the old men were unreliable, based on outdated memories that led the cyclist astray.

In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, ìThe old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my waterÖî He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didnít have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.  As the cyclist continued on his journey, the harsh reality of the barren landscape started to take a toll on him. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly, causing him to sweat profusely and feel more fatigued with each passing mile. The lack of civilization and resources in the desolate town he stumbled upon only added to his sense of desolation.

In unfavorable weather conditions, such as cold and rainy weather, the cyclist may not feel motivated to ride due to the dangers and discomfort it poses. Conversely, extremely hot weather can lead to quicker dehydration and exhaustion for the cyclist. The scenery around the cyclist can also impact their ride. For instance, a monotonous landscape like a desert may cause the cyclist to question their route and destination.

These factors demonstrate how external features can significantly influence a cyclist's experience and mindset while riding."
1693	7675	3	3	"The features of the setting exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the beginning of summer, when the cyclist ìarrived at the first ëtowní"" it was deserted, and the water had disgusting water. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a town ìtownî having it not really be a town anymore. The large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the hopeless lost tone. The eerie silence of the deserted town was only broken by the occasional creaking of a rusted sign swaying in the wind. As the cyclist pedaled through the empty streets, a sense of unease settled over them. The once vibrant town now lay in ruins, a mere shell of its former self. The graffiti-covered walls and broken windows painted a picture of decay and neglect. The cyclist quickened their pace, eager to leave behind this ghost town and continue on their journey."
1694	7676	3	3	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration.

The intense heat meant he had to drink more water to replenish his body from the sweat he was losing while biking. Additionally, the hilly terrain made it even more challenging for the biker, requiring him to use extra energy and fluids to keep going. If the weather had been cooler and breezier, he would have had an easier time covering the distance. Moreover, if the surrounding area was populated rather than abandoned, he would have had access to more water to drink. These environmental factors significantly impacted the biker's journey, highlighting the importance of considering the setting when engaging in physical activities."
1698	7680	3	3	"Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride Yosemite National park, but when some elderly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just begun. First of all, every ""town"" and ""building"" the men told him he would come to, wound up being completely deserted. At first, this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first deserted town, he, ""chuckled, checked [his] water supply, and moved."" As his journey progressed, his water decreased. He was then in desperation for a town. On top of that in the story he wrote, ''the tarmac road was replaced short, rolling hills."" This made his biking harder and he was then becoming dehydrated.

The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, ""A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen (Kurmaskie)."" This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. The cyclist comes to the first ""town"" but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that may affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt (Kurmaskie)."" This also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about. The harsh conditions and misleading landmarks in the setting would have a significant impact on the cyclist's experience, leading to frustration and disappointment."

Despite this setback, he pressed on towards his goal. Personally, I have never faced such a physically demanding challenge where I had to constantly motivate myself to keep going, only to be met with unexpected obstacles that tried to derail my progress.
1706	7688	3	3	"""Do not exceed posted speed limit"", is a short story about a man who is bicycling through Yosemite and he asks some elderly men for direction and they lead him in this ""old"" shortcut that takes him through tough terrain and extreme famine.
