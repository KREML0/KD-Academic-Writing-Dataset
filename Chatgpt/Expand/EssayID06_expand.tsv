1	14834	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated. Another problem is keeping the derigible @CAPS1 so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area. Additionally, the sheer height and narrowness of the Empire State Building made it difficult for dirigibles to safely navigate the docking process. The risks involved in attempting to overcome these obstacles ultimately led to the decision to repurpose the space for a more feasible and safer option for visitors to enjoy.
2	14835	6	3	Him from the start, there would have been many problems with allowing dirigibles to dock some 2000 feet in the air. The major problem here would be that the Empire State building was being constructed in New York City, a highly populated area. Below the mooring mast would be several other buildings were other people worked and lived. If something happened while he dirigible was attempting to dock, it could take out the building and the lives of the people in it. Not only that, but below were the city streets, where pedestrians walked. In paragraphs 2, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy, steel framed airship mooring at the top of the building. The frame would need to be very dense and, as the architects of the project discovered expensive. Other safety issues include the high winds that would drift the dirigibles off course, and the safety of dirigibles themselves. The passage mentions the Hindenburg incident, as well as the worry the owners of the building had about that happening over such a densely populated area. All in all, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have posed a significant risk to the safety of the people in the surrounding area and the structural integrity of the building itself. It is clear that the decision to abandon the idea was the right one, considering the potential dangers involved.
3	14836	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the need for a single cable tether to hold the dirigible, requiring costly modifications to strengthen the building's framework. Additionally, the use of highly flammable hydrogen in the dirigibles posed a significant safety risk in the densely populated area of New York City. Moreover, the requirement to weigh down the dirigibles with lead weights raised concerns about pedestrian safety, as the weights would dangle above the street. Furthermore, laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or approach the vicinity. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered in their attempts to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
4	14837	6	3	"In the 1930s, the Empire State Building faced challenges in its design to accommodate dirigibles for transportation between New York and New Jersey. Governor Al Smith, who oversaw the construction of the building, initially envisioned it to be a docking station for airships. However, the plans were altered after the building nearly lost its title as the world's tallest tower, prompting the addition of a top or ""hat"" to the structure. Furthermore, the tragic incident involving the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in 1937 over Lakehurst, New Jersey, highlighted the potential risks associated with airship travel, leading to the abandonment of the idea to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking purposes. Despite its original intent, the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended role in serving as a mooring mast for airships."
5	14838	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building. Another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, there would be a good chance that many people would be hurt. A final obstacle faced was ""nature itself."" The winds on the top of the Empire State building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though a dirigible would be attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around the mooring mast in a dangerous way. Many obstacles were faced by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow a dirigible to dock there. Despite these challenges, the builders were determined to find solutions and create a safe and innovative way for dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper."
6	14839	6	3	Soon after its conception, The Empire State Building mooring mast faced numerous challenges that ultimately led to its inevitable failure. While initial obstacles such as structural modifications to accommodate the added weight of moored airships were overcome, the project was dealt a significant blow with the Hindenburg disaster, marking the decline of airship travel. Additionally, the impracticality of mooring an airship at such a height, combined with the unpredictable winds at such altitudes, rendered the concept unfeasible. The final blow came with legislation prohibiting airship travel over urban areas, sealing the fate of the mooring mast. With these factors in play, the dream of successful airship travel from the Empire State Building was shattered, illustrating the rapid shift towards airplanes as the preferred mode of transportation in the modern era.
7	14840	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles while attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. The architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse. They strengthened the framework from the bottom of the building to the top before putting the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building. The builders were faced with these obstacles but they were successful in completing their goal. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station but it is still looked at as the final piece that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City. The Empire State Building stands as a testament to the ingenuity and determination of its builders, showcasing their ability to overcome challenges and create an iconic structure that continues to capture the imagination of people around the world.
8	14841	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the experiment showed that the wind current physically didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock. Additionally, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities was an obstacle they could not surpass. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles as transportation were long forgotten. The attempt to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles was ultimately unsuccessful, marking the end of a dream to revolutionize air travel in the early 20th century."
9	14842	6	3	The obstacles the builders face were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there. Additionally, they also had to deal with the challenge of finding a suitable location for the dirigible to land safely and securely in @LOCATION1. Despite these obstacles, the builders were determined to overcome them and successfully complete the construction of the dirigible. In the end, their hard work and perseverance paid off, and the dirigible was completed, ready to take flight.
10	14843	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a bold idea to tether dirigibles to the top of the building. However, this plan was fraught with challenges. Blimps were not known for their sturdiness, making them vulnerable to strong winds that could easily veer them off course into surrounding buildings. Additionally, the shift from helium to hydrogen gas in dirigibles raised concerns due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen. Even the smallest spark could lead to a catastrophic fire.  Furthermore, the docking system itself posed risks, as maintaining the dirigible's level required hanging lead weights off the side. The potential for these weights to detach and fall onto the bustling city below was a major safety hazard that could not be ignored. Considering these numerous dangers and logistical issues, the idea of tethering dirigibles to the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed impractical and unsafe.
11	14844	6	3	The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first conceived but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risks and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top of the Empire State Building was already a failure. Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the 200-foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation. So the roof would have to be redone in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and millions of dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin. Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign airships were made of hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable. In Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned.
12	14845	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, architects faced numerous obstacles. Placing a mooring mast on top of the building was not feasible due to the stress it would add to the framework, necessitating costly modifications. Safety concerns arose from the flammability of hydrogen used in foreign dirigibles and the unpredictable winds in the city. The risk of accidents, such as the Hindenburg disaster, highlighted the potential dangers of docking dirigibles in urban areas. Despite attempts to dock dirigibles on the building, high winds and legal restrictions ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea. The focus shifted to airplanes as the future of air travel, marking the end of the dirigible era in the city.
13	14846	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to construct this marvelous building. One obstacle was ensuring that the stress from the dirigible would be properly distributed to the foundation of the building. The steel frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, requiring over $1 million worth of modifications. Additionally, strong winds and air currents above the building posed a challenge, making it difficult for the dirigible to safely dock without endangering pedestrians below. Learning how to install a mooring mast also presented a time-consuming obstacle, as experts had to be consulted to determine the proper methods. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building proved to be a significant challenge for the builders. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building stands today as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of adversity.
14	14847	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Al Smith, the architect behind the idea, envisioned a structure that would surpass the Chrysler Building in height and be equipped for the future of transportation, including air travel by blimps. However, the challenges were significant. Dropping a mooring mast on the roof would stress the building's frame, posing structural risks. Moreover, the main obstacle was safety, as most dirigibles of the time used flammable hydrogen gas, making docking at a city center a hazardous proposition. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of the mooring mast. Despite numerous attempts and modifications, the idea was eventually abandoned, and the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended role as an airship docking station.
15	14848	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. The electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast, was crucial for the docking process. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangway to an open observation platform. To address these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts and took tours of the equipment and mooring operations of the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This research and collaboration were essential in overcoming the obstacles and successfully implementing a docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
16	14849	6	3	The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explores the challenges faced in the attempt to attach a landing dock to the Empire State Building. The main obstacle encountered was the strong wind speeds at the landing site, which posed a risk of destabilizing the dirigibles. To counter this, lead weights were considered, but this raised concerns about the building's foundation and structural integrity. Additionally, the use of hydrogen gas, though efficient for flight, was deemed too dangerous due to its flammability, leading to restrictions on its use in populated areas. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further hindering the feasibility of the mooring mast. Ultimately, these obstacles rendered the mooring mast project at the Empire State Building unachievable, highlighting the intricate challenges involved in combining air travel with urban infrastructure.
17	14850	6	3	In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, many obstacles had the engineers of the Empire State Building looking for a new way to dock dirigibles. One obstacle they had to face was the steelwork of the building. The pressure of the wind and the dirigible's load had cost the company a considerable amount of money. Secondly, they had to design a few special floors for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be for baggage and suitcases, while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be very durable, so special materials were needed to be brought in and used to create the building. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many obstacles when constructing the 1,250 ft. building. They had to carefully consider the structural integrity, passenger accommodations, and overall design to ensure the success of this monumental project.
18	14851	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced numerous challenges when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of the main issues was the strong wind currents, which made it difficult for pilots to get close enough to the docking mast. Even if they managed to approach, the forceful winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swing around uncontrollably. This made the docking process practically impossible to execute safely and effectively. Ultimately, the builders had to abandon the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building due to these insurmountable challenges.
19	14852	6	3	The first obstacle that it faced with having to reconstruct the body frame so that it could support the mooring mast. The second is that dirigibles from other country's used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. The third reason which should have been apparent from the start was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The last reason is the wind conditions at that height made it impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail and swaying in the wind. These challenges presented significant hurdles for the airship to overcome in order to successfully navigate and operate in the intended manner.
20	14853	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were mainly related to the stress it would put on the building's frame. The load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be supported all the way down to the building's foundation, which was a considerable distance below the surface. To make this possible, significant modifications and strengthening of the steel frame were necessary. This meant that over sixty thousand dollars worth of adjustments had to be made to ensure that the Empire State Building could safely accommodate dirigibles.
21	14854	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was the construction of a mooring mast that would not compromise the building's structure. To achieve this, the builders had to modify and reinforce the frame of the Empire State Building, necessitating over sixty thousand dollars' worth of adjustments to the framework. Additionally, safety concerns loomed large, as dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas at the time. Landing a hydrogen-filled dirigible at the Empire State Building's height would have been illegal, posing a grave danger to the hundreds of pedestrians below in the event of an explosion. These obstacles required careful consideration and innovative solutions to ensure the safety and structural integrity of the iconic building.
22	14855	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The wind current would cause the dirigible to drag the building with it because the wind current is very strong. The weight of the dirigible and the pressure of the wind may cause the building to collapse. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith didn't want to lose his title so he decides to make the building taller. The taller the building gets the stronger the wind current will be and the more it adds on the building. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Dirigibles should land in wide open areas where there isn't anything to harm the blimp, citizens, and passengers. The gases that are used to lift the dirigible to make it lighter than air are highly flammable. These are some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. Ultimately, it was crucial for the safety of all involved that the challenges of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building were carefully considered and addressed to prevent potential disaster.
23	14856	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. The lack of a suitable landing area was a significant challenge for the architects. Some Dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to four blocks in New York City, requiring a considerable amount of space for docking. This obstacle necessitated innovative solutions to ensure that the Dirigibles could fit properly and safely dock at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the architects had to overcome these challenges to accommodate the transportation of the future at the iconic building.
24	14857	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. The builder's mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of blimps over one thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was designing a landing area. This was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past. A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars. ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent wind currents at the top of the building and the blimps were never very stable. There were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible so this was a very dangerous obstacle. Lastly, the pre existing laws of airships flying the low over urban areas posed a new problem. even with successful architecture, laws disallowed the blimps in the first place! Planes were also becoming more popular. Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered and successfully designed a landing area for blimps, overcoming the various obstacles they faced."
25	14858	6	3	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles that the builder faced were actually having a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground. The strong air currents and changing in the wind direction also made it difficult for the piolots to steer the dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem that the builders faced was a law that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law prohibited dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building, as it would violate the regulations regarding the height of airships over urban areas. Therefore, despite efforts to accommodate dirigibles, the legal restrictions ultimately prevented them from docking at the iconic skyscraper."
26	14859	6	3	"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a fascinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole new ""age of transportation."" Unfortunately, this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. The architects building the mooring mast discovered that their idea was not feasible. The use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, in most dirigibles outside the U.S. posed a significant risk, especially considering the densely populated streets below. Additionally, the challenge of dealing with the strong winds proved to be insurmountable. The reality was that while mooring dirigibles sounded appealing, the risks involved were simply too great to carry out the plan."
27	14860	6	3	In addition to the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, another challenge arose from the fact that most dirigibles outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium. This posed a significant safety risk that further hindered the feasibility of using the mooring mast. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building presented a practical problem, as the shifting air currents would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking unsafe and impractical. Furthermore, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach or dock at the Empire State Building. Despite attempts by two dirigibles to reach the building, the idea was ultimately abandoned due to these insurmountable obstacles. The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its intended purpose, highlighting the complex and intricate factors that can impact the success of ambitious architectural endeavors.
28	14861	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major concern was the safety issue, particularly because most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen instead of helium, posing a significant fire hazard in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Additionally, the unpredictable winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, made it challenging for dirigibles to safely moor. The thrashing of the un-tied back of the dirigible in such conditions could potentially pose a danger to pedestrians below. Furthermore, there was a legal obstacle to contend with, as laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the vicinity. Consequently, the mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was never able to serve its intended purpose, ultimately rendering the idea unfeasible.
29	14862	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to land there. Safety problems were a major concern, as the dirigibles had to come very close to the building in order to be tied down, posing a risk to people below. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the situation. The builders also had to contend with the strong winds, which made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mast for docking. Ultimately, these challenges made it clear that turning the Empire State Building into a dirigible dock was not a feasible or safe option."
30	14863	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the Building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. The last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame. It was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast. To address the challenges, engineers conducted detailed structural analyses and made precise calculations to ensure that the addition of a mooring mast would not compromise the integrity of the iconic skyscraper. With careful planning and innovative design solutions, the Empire State Building ultimately overcame these obstacles to become a symbol of architectural and engineering excellence.
31	14864	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstacles when attempting to have dirigibles dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and building would add extra stress, so builders had to spend over sixty thousand dollars on reconstructions to fix the building's framework. Moreover, dirigibles dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, but it was unrealistic to expect any ship to attach to the building in high winds. Another challenge was the safety hazards posed by the highly flammable hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside the U.S. Additionally, the builders did not consider the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. Ultimately, the task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State Building proved to be an impossible feat.
32	14865	6	3	There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were over 800 feet long, which would be too much for the building to handle. Additionally, there would only be a single cable tether, adding stress to the building's frame. The entire steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars. However, the greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fulfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles in the United States used highly flammable hydrogen rather than safer helium. The violent air currents on top of the building also posed a significant challenge, as the winds constantly shifted, making it dangerous for dirigibles to dock. Even if tethered, the back of the ship would swivel around due to the unpredictable winds. Overall, the Empire State Building was not a suitable location for dirigibles to dock safely due to these various obstacles.
33	14866	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced included using hydrogen, which is flammable, dealing with the constantly shifting wind currents at the top of the building, the ship swiveling around the mooring mast, and complying with laws against flying too low over urban areas. These challenges posed significant risks and required careful navigation and adherence to safety protocols to ensure the success and safety of the project.
34	14867	6	3	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful. This would make it very difficult to actually get the dirigible close to the mast. Also the structure of Empire State Building. The framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. Builders made over $1 million worth of fortifying the framework. Those are some obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Another obstacle was the lack of space on the top of the building. The docking station had to be strategically placed to avoid interfering with other structures. Additionally, the unpredictability of weather conditions posed a significant challenge for dirigibles attempting to dock on the Empire State Building. Overall, despite these obstacles, builders were able to overcome them and successfully create a docking station for dirigibles on the iconic skyscraper.
35	14868	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although the builders thought it to be a brilliant idea, they did not carefully consider the safety hazards they may have encountered, and how unrealistic the idea truly was. One of the greatest reasons the mooring mast was destined to be unable to fulfill its purpose was because of safety concerns. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When a dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse an accident like that would be if it occurred over a place as densely populated as downtown New York. Another very practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the area, let alone be able to tie up to the building. It is very apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many issues in the attempt. Additionally, the sheer size and weight of a dirigible would have posed a significant structural challenge for the building, potentially compromising its integrity. Ultimately, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was not only unsafe but also impractical due to various legal and logistical obstacles. Thus, the vision of using the building as a mooring mast for airships was not feasible in reality."
36	14869	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building seem blind of all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast. One huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation. The blimp would be swung around on the tether going to the building, which could either damage the building itself, or damage the blimp. Also if the blimp was moving, how would passengers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building. Another factor was the high population of New York City, if something like debris had fallen down to the streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians. I would think that the architects would have considered all these factors before trying to begin the project.  Furthermore, the potential risks associated with the mooring mast do not stop at just the physical harm to individuals and property. The liability issues that could arise from accidents or incidents involving the blimp could have severe legal and financial consequences for all parties involved. It is crucial to thoroughly assess all possible dangers and implications before proceeding with such a project to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone in and around the Empire State building.
37	14870	6	3	In the excerpt, the construction of the Empire State Building faced challenges in its quest to become the tallest building in the world. Governor Al Smith's ambition to surpass existing records required the addition of a mooring mast, which introduced new risks due to violent air currents. Furthermore, a law prohibiting airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas was enacted following a tragic incident involving a German dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey. These obstacles posed significant hurdles for dirigibles passing by the Empire State Building, highlighting the complex interplay between ambition, regulation, and safety in the realm of architectural innovation.
38	14871	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A one thousand-foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame if placed at the top of the building. The building's frame would have to be strengthened and modified to accommodate the situation, costing over $1 million in modifications. Another obstacle was the safety concern, as dirigibles ran on flammable hydrogen. Additionally, the weather posed a challenge, with violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Lastly, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Ultimately, the idea of a dirigible docking at the Empire State Building quietly disappeared.
39	14872	6	3	Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be unique and practical, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying to low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area. These challenges made it clear that the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was not feasible, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious plan.
40	14873	6	3	The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to more at the Empire State Building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building itself posed a challenge, as dirigibles would have had to navigate through the tall buildings of New York City to reach the mooring mast. This would have been extremely risky and impractical. Ultimately, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was abandoned due to these various obstacles.
41	14874	6	3	Based on the story, it all started when they built the Empire State Building. The workers should have known that the building was too big for the wind climate up in the sky. Additionally, when constructing such a massive building, it is essential to ensure its strength and balance.  Challenges arose when the U.S. attempted to strike a deal to use the top of the building for a dock, allowing civilians to access the deck. Despite this agreement, a law was passed prohibiting blimps from landing on the dock. However, a blimp still attempted to land on the dock, causing further complications for the Empire State Building.
42	14875	6	3	Obstacles the builders faced included the challenge of adding a mooring at the top of the building, which would put additional stress on the structure and require modifications for support. Safety concerns also arose due to the flammable nature of the hydrogen-filled airships, posing a risk of fire that could endanger the densely populated area surrounding the building. Furthermore, the strong winds at higher altitudes presented a natural obstacle to the project. Additionally, regulations restricting low airship flights above urban areas added another layer of complexity to the construction process. These various challenges required careful planning and consideration to ensure the successful completion of the project.
43	14876	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. One obstacle was that most dirigibles were highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught on fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would affect many people since its a densely populated area. Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" One more obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The architects faced many obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality. It's better to plan ahead and think of every obstacle before bringing ideas to life. Ultimately, these challenges highlight the importance of thorough planning and consideration of potential barriers when embarking on ambitious architectural projects."
44	14877	6	3	The builders had a very hard time because of where it was located, and how the dirigible was to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, it was hard to work on. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling in on the building, so it had to be reinforced. The final problems that made them most an unreliable choice, were the wind conditions and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely. These all contributed to make the mast on the Empire State Building a bad idea.  Additionally, the high altitude of the Empire State Building made it difficult for the builders to access materials and transport equipment to the construction site. The strong winds at such a height also posed a challenge, making it dangerous for workers to operate. Furthermore, the unpredictable weather conditions in New York City added to the complexity of the construction process, causing delays and hindrances.  In conclusion, the challenges faced by the builders in constructing the mast on the Empire State Building were significant and ultimately made it an impractical choice. The combination of height, wind conditions, and structural limitations made the project a risky and unreliable endeavor.
45	14878	6	3	From the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the architects building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced was the winds on top of the building, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, making it unstable. To weigh it down, they would have to use lead weights, but this was deemed impractical and unsafe, as dangling heavy weights high above people on the street posed a significant risk. Overall, the architects encountered numerous challenges in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles, with many solutions proving either unfeasible or hazardous.
46	14879	6	3	There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirigible, the building's frame would have stress. They also noticed that the dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders' control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.
47	14880	6	3	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City. In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it."
48	14881	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was modifying and strengthening the frame of the building. It says that ""over $1000 thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" in order to accommodate dirigibles. However, after the modifications were made, the builders had to face another set of obstacles, more serious than before. The first one was ""safety"": the destruction of the Hindenburg in New Jersey raised fear for a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle was ""nature""; the strong winds and violent air currents on the top of the Empire State Building made dirigibles ""neither practical nor safe"". The third obstacle was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles attempted a few things, but unsuccessfully, and the idea of dirigibles disappeared by the late 1930s. These are the obstacles that the builders faced in attempting dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
49	14882	6	3	Based on the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is clear that nature presented the greatest challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. The shifting winds and violent air currents made it unsafe for dirigibles to be moored at the building. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the possibility of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. Despite attempts by two dirigibles to reach the building, the obstacles proved insurmountable, and dirigibles were never able to moor at the iconic structure.
50	14883	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles were significant. Initially proposed by former governor of New York, Al Smith, the idea of a mooring mast was born out of a desire to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the world. However, challenges such as stability, safety, and unpredictable wind currents proved to be insurmountable. The stress that a tethered dirigible would place on the building's frame, the flammability of hydrogen gas used in foreign dirigibles, and the uncontrollable swiveling caused by wind currents ultimately led to the decision that dirigibles would not be able to dock at the Empire State Building. The safety of New York City residents was paramount, and the vision of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned."
51	14884	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @PERSON1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with that should have been apparent before they built the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" It says in the ""The Mooring Mast"" that at the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also if the dirigibles were tethered, the back of them would move around while the dirigibles would also be high above the city with people watching. Unsafe for many. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It's illegal for a ship to tie up with the building or to even go to an area like that. These thing should have been brought to the builders attention with obstacles such as nature and lawbreaking are in play. Additionally, the structural integrity of the mooring mast and its ability to withstand the forces exerted by the airships should have been thoroughly considered before construction. Without addressing these issues, the viability and safety of using the mooring mast would always be in question. Ultimately, the oversight of these crucial factors led to the impracticality and inefficacy of the mooring mast at the Empire State Building."
52	14885	6	3	Based on the excerpt, builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles. They had to create intricate and challenging plans, especially when it came to designing the mast for the building. The potential risk of Blimps and aircraft crashing into the structure added another layer of difficulty to their task. The height of the mast presented a significant challenge as well, requiring careful consideration and adjustments to the existing plans. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic Empire State Building.
53	14886	6	3	"Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly weather and safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This means that because of the wind and air currents always shifting, the dirigibles would be hard to control. Another obstacle they faced was safety. Also in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" What that means is having something heavy dangling above people is not a good idea. It wouldn't be a good idea because if the weight would of disconnected from the dirigibles there is a possibility that somebody could get injured badly. Those obstacles are what builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock."
54	14887	6	3	"Thraghat The process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual ""building"" process. Because the mast would add too much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the builders had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time-consuming project. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building had to do with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, which was very unsafe. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles, making it a challenging and complex endeavor."
55	14888	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. This would have made it challenging for workers to operate in such conditions. Additionally, the wind pressure on the dirigible, hanging on a single cable, would have posed a major obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework, further complicating the construction process. These challenges would have required careful planning and execution to ensure the safety and stability of the Empire State Building.
56	14889	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the readers learn that there are obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects were concerned about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure transmitted to the building's foundation. They realized the need to strengthen and modify the structure to accommodate this new challenge. Additionally, the architects were wary of foreign dirigibles using hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, unlike the safer helium used in the U.S.  One major hindrance was the shifting winds at the building's peak, causing the tethered dirigible to swivel uncontrollably. Despite their initial plan for a mooring mast, it eventually transitioned into an observation deck. This shift in purpose showcased the architects' adaptability and innovation in overcoming obstacles while still utilizing the building's unique features effectively.
57	14890	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the stress on the building's frame from a dirigible tethered by a cable, requiring costly modifications. Additionally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to approach or tie up to the building. The architects also struggled with nature, a challenge difficult to solve and control. Ultimately, these obstacles led them to postpone the endeavor, hoping for future technological advancements to achieve their goal.
58	14891	6	3	"When they build the Empire State Building they faced obstacles building it. An obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architetures wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles (blimps). This was dangerous. It was because the Mast could snap at such a high altitude and plumate to the ground or snap, and dangle high above the street. ""... The Government people in washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith four year term governor of New York. Although it may look nice, its not the safest idea."
59	14892	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, the builders couldn't simply place a mast on top of the empire state building, because the building would surely collapse. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the empire state building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the modifications. Another obstacle the builder's failed to see was the actual construction of a modern-day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been horrible over a densely populated area of New York. Lastly, the greatest obstacle of the building was nature itself. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"". this would be very dangerous. The dirigible could @CAPS1 over pedestrians the streets meaning it was not safe at all. There are three obstacles that prevented the empire state building from allowing dirigibles to dock there. Ultimately, these challenges proved too formidable, leading to the decision to abandon the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building."
60	14893	6	3	In addition to the challenges of how the dirigibles would be secured to the mast and prevented from swiveling in the wind, another significant obstacle faced by the builders was the highly flammable nature of the hydrogen used in the dirigibles. This raised concerns about the safety of the structure, as a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building with just a single cable tether would place additional stress on the framework. The use of hydrogen, known for its combustible properties, added a layer of complexity to the project. Finding solutions to these issues would be crucial for the successful implementation of the mooring mast for dirigibles.
61	14894	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. One of the problems that they faced was that many dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This factor caused the owners of the Building to worry about the safety of the many civilians that lived in downtown New York. Another factor that the builders faced was that the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This caused problems because in landing fields the blimps could be weighted down with lead weights but that could not be done at the Empire State Building; many dirigibles would not be able to reach the Building either due to the winds. One last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. All these factors caused the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and passengers to disappear. Ultimately, these challenges led to the abandonment of the original plan to have airships dock at the Empire State Building.
62	14895	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders faced an obstacle when constructing the top of the Empire State Building. The dock section of the tower was unstable, and the frame was not initially able to support a dirigible. The designers came up with a new plan for a sleek, modern tower made of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, illuminated from within. The winches and machinery were to be housed in the base of the shaft, and an observation deck was added for passengers awaiting the dirigible. However, another challenge arose due to a law prohibiting aircraft from flying too close to urban areas. Despite the difficulties and high cost, the innovative design of the tower eventually overcame these obstacles."
63	14896	6	3	"Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was the stress a dirigible would add to the building. By mooring a large dirigible to the building with a single cable tether, the structure had to withstand the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure transmitted throughout. This required over $1 million in modifications to strengthen the building's frame. Additionally, foreign dirigibles filled with highly flammable hydrogen posed a significant danger, as demonstrated by the German dirigible disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Moreover, the fierce winds at the top of the Empire State Building caused the tethered dirigible to sway around the mooring mast, creating a hazard for those below. The established law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building, further complicating the feasibility of the project. In conclusion, despite the ambition to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, various challenges, including structural concerns, safety risks, and legal restrictions, ultimately made this vision unattainable."
64	14897	6	3	"In @PERSON1's excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although dirigibles were a modern form of transportation they were highly dangerous. As it states in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen in highly flammable."" This along with the ""violent air currents"" as stated in paragraph @NUM2, were two of the risks that the builders had to take into consideration. The builders needed to converse the idea of a safe way in which dirigibles could dock there insuring that no one gets hurt. Another obstacle the builders had to take into consideration was the law passed in which was, ""against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" as explained in paragraph @NUM3. The excerpt clearly explains the complications the builders had to endure and take into thought when constructing the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building underwent many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to carefully navigate through the challenges posed by the flammability of hydrogen, violent air currents, and legal restrictions on airship travel to ensure the safety of all involved."
65	14898	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle the builders had to overcome was the constantly changing winds caused by air currents. Additionally, many dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used flammable Hydrogen, posing a significant risk if an explosion were to occur. Furthermore, the use of lead weights to stabilize the blimps could endanger people below, and the sharp spires of surrounding buildings added to the safety concerns. Moreover, a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas further restricted the possibility of dirigibles docking at the empire state building. These obstacles proved insurmountable for the builders, ultimately leading to the decision to not allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic structure."
66	14899	6	3	There are many obstacles that the builders face when creating the empire state building. First off the height of the building more come into question as much and there were to many discussions about the Top of the building. The empire state buildings first goal was to be the future of city they wanted to food people onto blimp. another problem is where really is know way to get the blimp steady enough to stick to the building and the large aircrafts are not suppose to fly back close to the building because other building are around. In conclusion, they did face many problems, such as the challenges with the height of the building and the difficulties in accommodating blimps due to the lack of a steady surface for them to dock. These issues highlighted the complexities involved in constructing the iconic Empire State Building.
67	14900	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the greatest being safety. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Also another issue was purposed in paragraph @NUM2, this was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered down, the back of of the ship would swivel around the morning mass. Yet another obstacle as to the reason why dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was in paragraph @NUM3, this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to serve it's original purpose. However, despite these challenges, the builders persevered and the Empire State Building stands as an iconic symbol of architectural and engineering achievement in the heart of New York City.
68	14901	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. There were high violent air currents causing the building to constantly shift. It was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, the unpredictable weather conditions, such as strong winds and storms, made it challenging for airships to safely dock at the mast. The harsh elements posed a significant risk to both the airships and the structure itself. Despite efforts to overcome these natural barriers, the mooring mast ultimately proved to be unsustainable and impractical for regular use.
69	14902	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason is the dirigibles were unsafe. This is because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights are dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the wind could have pushed the ship onto sharp spires, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots wouldn't be able to get the mooring equipment. These are the obstacles the builders face, which caused the mooring equipment not to be installed. Despite the efforts to find a solution, the challenges were too great to overcome, ultimately preventing the installation of the mooring equipment at the Empire State building.
70	14903	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety reasons, weather conditions, and government laws, defeated the purpose of the mooring mast on top of the building. For example, many of the dirigibles used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium, ""hydrogen is highly flammable... above a densely populated area."" The builders realized this was not smart. Furthermore, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" This created a dangerous situation because the ship would swing around the mast. Lastly, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting a ship to even approach the building. ""...an existing law against airships flyinging too low over urban areas"" . The whole idea that was built up to something great had slowly dwindled. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many more, in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Despite their efforts, the challenges proved insurmountable, and the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was never realized."
71	14904	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2.). If an accident like German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved. Due to the structural stress, potential flammability issues, and challenging wind conditions, the idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles was deemed unfeasible and unsafe."
72	14905	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework before they could even begin building the mast. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mast could begin to be framed. This process required meticulous planning and precise execution to ensure the structural integrity of the building while accommodating the innovative feature of dirigible docking. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic Empire State Building, a testament to human ingenuity and determination.
73	14906	6	3	Builders faced numerous challenges when considering allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One major concern was the additional stress a thousand-foot dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would place on the building's frame. This would necessitate structural modifications to ensure the building's stability. Additionally, the use of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, in dirigibles outside the United States posed a significant safety risk in a densely populated city like New York. These factors highlight the complexities and risks associated with incorporating dirigible docking facilities at the Empire State Building.
74	14907	6	3	"The obstacles on allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were far too great, something that should have been obvious before construction started. One major reason, safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is very flammable, and after the ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst, the idea was shot down. Another reason why it just didn't work was the wind current at the top of the Empire State building. Winds would have been too great for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State. There was already a law about Airships flying too low over urban areas. With a dirigible approaching the building would make it illegal. Thus ending the idea to proceed."
75	14908	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame, requiring over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself, as violent air currents caused the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, rendering tethering ineffective. Lead weights were not a viable solution, as dangling weights high above pedestrians was deemed impractical and unsafe. These challenges made it clear to architects that the project, at that time, was simply impossible.
76	14909	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. In the excerpt said ""the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to fail."" A somehow unseen obstacle was the fact that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium"" which is a much more unstable gas and if a dirigible caught fire and went down over New York many civilians would be killed or wounded. Another obstacle the builders faced was ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would make it very difficult to ancor a dirigible down to the mast and as the excerpt said they could not use lead weights hanging from the underside of the dirigible because they would be hanging over citizens below. Those are the problems faced by the builders of the empire state building."
77	14910	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building encountered many obstacles. These obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the steel frame of the empire state building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation."" Another obstacle was safety. Having an accident would be detrimental to many peoples' lives, because it is located in such a densely populated area. Also the winds made the whole thing very dangerous. Lastly there was an existing law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Additionally, the height of the building posed challenges in terms of elevator transportation and fire safety measures. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully completed the construction of the iconic Empire State Building."
78	14911	6	3	In addition to the speed, landing area, and passenger boarding concerns, the builders also face challenges in ensuring the safety and stability of the dirigible during takeoff and flight. It is crucial for the builders to design a sturdy structure that can withstand the forces of nature and provide a smooth and secure journey for the passengers. By addressing these obstacles, the builders can successfully integrate dirigibles into modern transportation systems and offer a unique and efficient mode of travel for people around the world.
79	14912	6	3	"There were plenty of problems engineers at the empire state building faced when they wanted to dock dirigibles. Well for starters, the winds up that high were over-powering, as it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also there was the dirigibles themselfs that caused a problem For they were filled with hydrogen, which is very flamable, One other problem was air laws they state that dirigibles, in urban areas, were not to fly too low. It is because of these problems that destroyed Al Smith's Idea that building could dock airships. Additionally, the size of the dirigibles also posed a challenge as they were quite large and difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. Moreover, the lack of a suitable landing platform on the building made it hard for the dirigibles to safely dock without causing damage to the structure. Overall, the combination of strong winds, flammable hydrogen gas, air regulations, and logistical difficulties made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
80	14913	6	3	"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a dangor for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangorous for passengers and workers on the dirigible. L¸sted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This goes to show that any project should be checked for safety precautions at all times. The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there highlight the importance of considering safety precautions and legal regulations in any project. The dangers posed by violating existing laws and the unpredictable nature of weather conditions underscore the necessity of thorough planning and adherence to regulations in public transportation projects."
81	14914	6	3	Al Smith's dream of having airships dock atop the Empire State Building was cut short by bitter reality. The idea failed partially due to the impracticality of docking a massive balloon filled with flammable gas to a city building. The sheer size of the airships was astounding and posed many challenges. The unpredictable and strong winds at the top of a skyscraper made it extremely difficult to safely dock the airships, as demonstrated by the failed attempt of the Los Angeles airship. Moreover, the airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas, which had caused catastrophic accidents in the past, like the Hindenburg disaster. Engineers were well aware that any similar incident at the Empire State Building could result in significant damage to the city and the building itself. Ultimately, the use of airplanes, with their greater reliability and safety, made it clear that airships would never be able to dock at the Empire State Building.
82	14915	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge as dirigibles struggled to navigate the building's peak safely. The limited space atop the building made it hard for dirigibles to land and dock securely, further complicating the docking process. Moreover, the unpredictable weather conditions in New York City, especially strong winds, made it risky for dirigibles to attempt docking at the mooring mast. Despite the initial vision of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the various obstacles and safety concerns ultimately led to the discontinuation of this practice.
83	14916	6	3	In addition to the structural challenges of supporting a dirigible, the risk of accidents and the legal restrictions on flying over urban areas, the builders also had to contend with the unpredictable and strong winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These winds posed a significant danger to any dirigible attempting to dock, making it a hazardous endeavor. Overall, the combination of these obstacles made it impractical and unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
84	14917	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One major concern was the inability to install a mooring mast at the top of the building due to fears that the single cable holding the dirigible would add stress to the frame. The high altitude and strong winds posed another challenge, with the wind currents being volatile and constantly shifting, causing the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, the urban setting of the building presented a danger as nearby structures could potentially pierce the dirigibles or pose a threat to pedestrians below. These obstacles required modifications and strengthening of the building's frame to accommodate the docking of dirigibles.
85	14918	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges regarding the intended use of the building. Initially, the issue arose with the building's frame, as the plan to have a dirigible docked at the top would put too much stress on the structure. This required costly modifications to redistribute the load and account for the additional weight and wind forces. However, a new problem emerged related to the safety concerns of having a dirigible mast atop the building, particularly due to the flammability of the hydrogen gas often used in such airships. The risk of a potential explosion posed a significant threat that had not been adequately considered during the planning stages. Despite these obstacles, the architects had to address these issues to ensure the safety and structural integrity of the iconic Empire State Building.
86	14919	6	3	In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof of the empire state building, the workers would have to go through a series of tasks such as, strengthening the steel frame, and designing a sturdy mast. If the frame were not strong enough, then the building would simply colapse. More than sixty thousand dollars was spent on restructuring the frame. Also with high-speed winds the mast would have be incredibly sturdy, otherwise the dirigible would not stay in one place. After the Hindenburg disaster, people realized how unsafe these dirigibles really were, and so the idea was found not only unsafe but it illegal. In conclusion, not a single blimp would ever be docked, nor will one ever.
87	14920	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. Similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which was constantly shifting at heights of over 1,400 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the building's foundation. This was a high safety concern and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast virtually impossible. Ultimately, the challenges of structural integrity, safety, and legal restrictions made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building.
88	14921	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to establish a docking station for dirigibles. Al Smith's vision of adding a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building for dirigible docking proved challenging. The architects encountered difficulties in placing the mooring mast on top of the building, as the flat roof couldn't support it adequately. With only one cable holding a dirigible, transmitting its load and withstanding wind pressure down the entire structure posed safety concerns. Moreover, the presence of highly flammable hydrogen in many dirigibles raised additional risks. To address this, sandbags hung by ropes above people below, yet the windy conditions around the Empire State Building complicated matters further. While the mooring mast concept was promising, the project was ultimately abandoned due to these insurmountable challenges."
89	14922	6	3	"Though in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed attainable, in reality there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial problem was faced during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building. As stated in the article: ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This modification, necessary to overcome the obstacle of attaching the mooring mast consumed over @NUM1 thousand dollars and much time and effort. A second obstacle which interfered immensely with safety was ""nature itself."" The violent winds at the top of the building would cause tethered dirigibles to ""swivel around and around"" the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in airfields could be weighted down by lead weights, but this idea could not be executed because ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Such problems as these created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building. The challenges faced in modifying the steel frame and addressing the safety concerns related to the violent winds highlight the complexity of implementing a mooring mast on the iconic skyscraper."
90	14923	6	3	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there. These challenges highlight the complex considerations involved in integrating dirigibles into urban environments, emphasizing the need for meticulous planning and innovative solutions to ensure safety and efficiency.
91	14924	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building believed that dirigibles were able to dock on the building if there was a mooring mast. However, there were many obstacles to overcome to allow this to happen. If a dirigible landed on the mast, it would force a lot of pressure on the building as it swayed in the wind. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored... would add stress to the building's frame."" And as nature played a role, the wind could swing the body of the dirigible, possibly causing the frame of the building to break and the building to collapse. Another obstacle that the architects faced was danger. American dirigibles used helium, while dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. ""... the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey..."" The architects realized that the Hindenburg explosion would have been worse if it occurred on the Empire State building ""... above a densely populated area..."". Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigibles posed a challenge in terms of maneuvering them safely onto the mooring mast, especially in adverse weather conditions. These factors combined to make the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State building a risky and impractical proposition."
92	14925	6	3	In addition to the safety concerns regarding the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, there were also issues with the structural integrity of the building itself. The weight and size of the dirigibles posed a significant risk to the stability of the mooring dock, as the building was not originally designed to support such heavy loads. Furthermore, the logistics of docking and undocking the dirigibles in a safe and efficient manner presented a challenge, as there was limited space for maneuvering at the top of the building. Despite the potential benefits of having a dirigible dock, these obstacles made it clear that the idea was not feasible in reality.
93	14926	6	3	"In addition to the challenges of supporting the weight of dirigibles and ensuring the safety of docking in a populated area, the builders of the Empire State Building also faced the issue of weather conditions. As mentioned in paragraph 4, ""the wind at the top of the building could reach dangerous speeds, making it difficult for a dirigible to safely dock."" To address this concern, the designers had to come up with a solution to stabilize the mooring mast in strong winds. This required additional engineering and design work to ensure that the docking process would be safe and feasible. Despite the numerous obstacles and challenges faced by the builders, their determination and innovative thinking ultimately led to the creation of a groundbreaking structure that continues to capture the imagination of people around the world."
94	14927	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building could not dock dirigibles because of the building's structure, the winds pushing the dirigibles, and public safety. The structure could not handle the swaying dirigible becacse of the winds pushing the back side. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. this quote shows how dangerous it would be to put a large flammable dirigible over new york and the people in new york. Additionally, the presence of flammable hydrogen gas in close proximity to a densely populated area like New York City posed a significant risk of a potential disaster. Therefore, for the safety of the public and the structural integrity of the building, docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option."
95	14928	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained why there is a landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The first obstacle the workers faced was there was no Landing space on the top of the Empire State Building. This means dirigibles could @CAPS4 at all. To fix the problem of not having a Landing area is, they would add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building. The workers used a @CAPS2 of money to make the building so it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles was held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so violent that the dirigible couldn't maneuver. to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out they gave up. Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained what the workers tried to do to get a dirigible to @CAPS4 on the Empire State Building in the excerpt The Mooring Mast.  Despite their efforts to create a landing area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building with the construction of the Mooring Mast, the workers ultimately faced challenges due to the violent winds that made it impossible for the dirigibles to maneuver effectively. This setback led to the workers abandoning their plans, highlighting the difficulties they encountered in their endeavor.
96	14929	6	3	Most of the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building had were due to weather. If New York ever had a windy day the dirigible would pull at the mast. The mast is attached to the top of the building, and it might affect the frames or structure of the building. Another reason is the danger it would bring to all of New York. If a dirigible ever hit something or something went wrong the dirigible would crash on top of New York. With all the traffic of New York you would most likely not want a burning dirigible falling overhead. Additionally, the presence of strong winds could make it difficult for workers to safely navigate and work at such great heights, posing a serious risk to their safety. Furthermore, the unpredictable weather conditions could delay construction progress, leading to increased costs and potential setbacks in completing the project on time. In conclusion, the challenges posed by weather conditions during the construction of the Empire State Building were significant and required careful planning and management to ensure the safety of workers and the successful completion of the iconic structure.
97	14930	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof. It would add stress to the building's frame. Another problem that faced the builders was that hydrogen is very flamable. If a dirigible had been caught on fire and exploded, over downtown New York, then law suites would be made. Another problem that faced the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the winds at the top of the building. There were shifting winds due to violent air currents and these winds would make it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock. The last obstacle was the fact that there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Additionally, the weight of the dirigibles and the potential impact on the building's structure had to be carefully considered. Furthermore, the logistics of safely maneuvering the massive airships in a densely populated area like Manhattan posed a significant challenge. Despite these hurdles, the builders persisted in their efforts to make the Empire State Building a hub for air travel, showcasing their determination and innovative spirit.
98	14931	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there due to the height and altitude of the Zeppelin. Even if they managed to dock, the back of the dirigible would sway in the wind, creating safety concerns. Moreover, the infamous Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937, where the airship caught fire and was destroyed, highlighted the flammability of dirigibles that used hydrogen instead of helium. These incidents emphasized the need to address safety issues before allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
99	14932	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were exceptionally long, some reaching up to one thousand feet in length. These airships were docked using an electric winch system that hauled in a line from the front to the back of the dirigible. Dropping a mooring mast on top of the building was not feasible due to the immense size and weight of the dirigibles. The building's frame would have to be significantly strengthened to support the weight of a one thousand-foot dirigible, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars for the necessary framework alone. Additionally, safety concerns arose as dirigibles outside of the United States typically contained highly flammable helium. In the event of an accident, such as the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated downtown area of New York would be at great risk. Considering these challenges, it became evident that docking dirigibles at the Empire State building was not a viable or safe option.
100	14933	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One was that they had to find a way that would not make the building too unstable, as a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the frame. Another obstacle was the strong winds, which would be unsafe for the dirigible to be up there, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Additionally, it was deemed too dangerous to have the dirigible up there because the gases within were extremely flammable, especially since most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Furthermore, there is a law that does not allow airships to come too close to the ground in urban areas, presenting another challenge for the builders. In conclusion, while the idea of porting dirigibles may have seemed appealing, the practicality of implementing it was hindered by various significant obstacles.
101	14934	6	3	In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles at the mooring mast. One significant hurdle was the need to alter the building's original structure, which required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to meet the requirements of the mooring mast. Additionally, safety concerns arose due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen gas used in dirigibles outside the United States, posing a considerable risk of accidents. The unpredictable and strong winds further complicated the situation, making it unsafe for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Despite their best efforts, the builders were met with formidable obstacles that ultimately hindered the successful use of the mooring mast.
102	14935	6	3	"There were many different obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles. For example ""the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Because of the weather itself it caused them not to be able to build the mooring mast. Another reason is ""using the empire state Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". It could easily kill people that were roaming around. Lastly they could not more at the empire State Building because ""It was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Additionally, the structural limitations of the building made it challenging to accommodate dirigibles, as the design and materials used were not suitable for supporting the weight and stress of airships. The safety concerns for both the dirigible passengers and people on the ground were paramount, making it a risky endeavor. Despite the initial plans and aspirations, the obstacles proved insurmountable, leading to the decision to abandon the idea of using the empire state building as a mooring mast for dirigibles."""
103	14936	6	3	During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was Nature. The winds at this height are shifting too frequently, causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas, making it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building. These obstacles forced the builders to shelve the mooring mast construction. Ultimately, despite their best efforts, the challenges presented by nature, the risks associated with lead weights, and the legal restrictions on airship heights proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the mooring mast project atop the Empire State Building.
104	14937	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were some of the following. They needed an exact way of getting everything perfect for the job. The whole building process for this job was very complicating and needed the best expertise. In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith's quote greatly backs up to my point. He says ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast."" It tells just how much people are working on this job. In conclusion, this was a complicated job. They weren't positive if the mast even be able to stay. They also weren't positive if the fluids inside would be but a problem factor. It is clear that the challenges faced by the builders in making the Empire State Building dirigible-friendly were immense and required meticulous planning and execution to overcome."
105	14938	6	3	"In the piece ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes what the mast on the Empire State Building was really for. There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One problem they faced was that the dirigible landing on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, necessitating modifications and strengthening. Safety was also a significant issue for the mast, as dirigibles used hydrogen, which could potentially catch fire and be destroyed over a densely populated area. Moreover, the shifting winds on top of the building caused the back of the ship to swivel around, posing a challenge for safe docking. Lastly, the project was not successful due to laws prohibiting airships from flying too low, which hindered the practicality of using the mast for dirigible docking. Before constructing such a feature, careful consideration of potential obstacles and drawbacks should have been undertaken to ensure its feasibility."
106	14939	6	3	Al Smith's competitive nature was put to the test when he found himself in a race to build the tallest building in New York. His rival, the Chrysler building, posed a challenge that Al could not ignore. If Al did not surpass the height of the Chrysler building, he risked losing the coveted title of having the tallest building in the city. This fierce competition drove Al to push the limits of his architectural abilities and strive for excellence in order to come out on top. In the end, Al's determination paid off as his building proudly stood taller than the Chrysler building, solidifying his place in history as a formidable force in the world of architecture.
107	14940	6	3	"Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers failed to notice this law. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another issue to be addressed, leading to additional costs. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made maneuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible' Los Angeles' approach the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Ultimately, despite the innovation and ingenuity behind the concept, various challenges, including legal restrictions, structural concerns, and natural elements, prevented the realization of the dirigible docking area at the Empire State Building."
108	14941	6	3	There were many challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State building when considering using it as a mooring mast for dirigibles. Changes had to be made to the building's skeleton to support the docking of the airships, as the original design would have put too much stress on the structure. Additionally, the safety of the people inside the building was a major concern, as the highly flammable helium inside the dirigibles posed a serious risk. The violently shifting winds in the area also presented a challenge, as they could potentially damage the blimps or cause them to collide with the building. These obstacles ultimately led to the Mooring Mast idea never becoming a reality, despite its initial appeal.
109	14942	6	3	The idea of docking dirigibles on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one. It seems as though the dream of dirigible transportation was on its way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al Smith's competitive nature not only pushed the building to an unprecedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, and effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skeptical. What if it were to blow up over a crowded New York City street? Also, an existing law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigible plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed, by the late 1930s, the idea of dirigibles atop the Empire State Building had disappeared.
110	14943	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders failed to realize that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. One of the greatest obstacles was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents. This made it difficult for dirigibles to land properly and posed a risk to pedestrians below. Additionally, the dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, which was not suitable for landing at the Empire State Building. Moreover, there was already a law in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. Overall, there were many factors that the builders should have considered before attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as it posed significant risks and challenges.
111	14944	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles, there were also concerns about the safety of passengers and crew during the docking process. The shifting winds and violent currents on the building's rooftop could pose a significant risk to those attempting to land a dirigible. Furthermore, the swiveling motion of the dirigible around the mooring mast could make it difficult for passengers and crew to safely disembark from the airship. These safety concerns added another layer of complexity to the already difficult task of designing a functional mooring mast for the Empire State Building. Despite the builders' best efforts to overcome these obstacles, the legal restrictions prohibiting dirigibles from landing on the building ultimately proved to be an insurmountable barrier. As a result, the vision of a bustling airship port atop the Empire State Building was never realized.
112	14945	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were wheather. Nature itself would ruin the time frame of building. Winds would shift, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed a significant obstacle for the builders, as they had to find alternative solutions for airship docking. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building was eventually completed and became an iconic symbol of New York City, standing tall against all odds.
113	14946	6	3	The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring at the top of the building were primarily due to the unpredictable winds above the structure. These winds constantly shifted in direction and intensity, making it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock without swinging dangerously in the air. This swinging motion not only posed risks to passengers boarding and disembarking from the airship but also increased the likelihood of the dirigible colliding with nearby buildings, potentially causing damage and endangering individuals on the ground. Furthermore, the act of attaching a dirigible to the building also introduced structural instability, requiring modifications to the building's frame to provide additional support. Ultimately, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was deemed unfeasible and unrealistic due to these significant safety concerns and structural challenges.
114	14947	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles while trying to dock dirigibles. One major challenge was the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building, which were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This made it difficult for dirigibles to remain stable even when tethered to the mooring mast, risking dangerous swiveling of the ships. Additionally, the safety concerns posed by dirigibles using highly flammable hydrogen gas and the potential risk of accidents involving falling lead weights above a populated city further complicated the docking process. Moreover, a law prohibiting ships from flying in low urban areas would have prevented the mooring mast from being utilized even if it had been successfully implemented. These combined factors ultimately led to the abandonment of the concept in the late 1930s."
115	14948	6	3	"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Al Smith had the idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The idea sounded great with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy-five miles per hour and covering thousands of feet without needing to be refueled. Anxious, Al Smith was very unsure of when they would all be done, stating, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" However, it would not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Another problem that arose was the presence of violent wind currents, further complicating the docking process for dirigibles. Ultimately, the fate of the dirigible as a form of transportation faded out as airplanes became a more suitable mode of transport for passengers."
116	14949	6	3	Based on the excerpt I just read, the @ORGANIZATION1 faced several obstacles during their journey. One of the challenges they encountered was a balloon with helium and flames, making it difficult to control. Additionally, the Empire State Building presented another hurdle with its flat roof. These obstacles posed significant challenges for the @ORGANIZATION1 as they navigated their way through their mission.
117	14950	6	3	There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the Stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above there heads, it poses a threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights cold not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed too fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose. Despite the effort and innovation put into the project, the challenges proved insurmountable, ultimately rendering the idea impractical and unfeasible.
118	14951	6	3	Dirigibles, also known as Blimps, used to dock at the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building served as a docking ground for these enormous steel-formed balloons, which were filled with hydrogen and helium, making them lighter than air. With a top speed of approximately 50 mph, dirigibles could travel for thousands of miles. Al Smith recognized the potential of the Empire State Building as a docking station. By adding a mooring mast to the top of the building, dirigibles could anchor there for several hours for refueling, maintenance, and embarkation and disembarkation of passengers. The dirigibles were secured using an electric winch that prevented them from drifting away and tethered them to the mast. Al Smith's initiative in building the mooring mast proved to be beneficial for dirigibles, further establishing the Empire State Building as a strategic location for air travel.
119	14952	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was that it wouldnt be able to tie cable tether, because it adds stress to the buildings frame. Also in the story they tell you how the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommadate to the new situation. The modifications to the steel frame would have to be carefully planned and executed to ensure the structural integrity of the building. Additionally, the builders would have to consider the added weight and stress that the dirigibles would place on the building when docking. These challenges required innovative engineering solutions to overcome in order to successfully integrate a dirigible docking station into the Empire State Building.
120	14953	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" many builders faced obstacles when attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building due to safety concerns. While the idea seemed promising, there were potential risks involved. The Empire State Building, although an impressive structure, posed challenges for dirigibles to dock safely, particularly because of the strong winds in the area. Additionally, many dirigibles from other countries, like Germany, utilized hydrogen in their blimps, which could be hazardous in a densely populated city like New York. Despite being hailed as the future of transportation, dirigibles required meticulous safety measures, especially when operating over a bustling city. The structure of the Empire State Building may have seemed suitable, but precautions were essential to ensure the safety of the building and the people below. Ultimately, while dirigibles offered a viable transportation solution, their use over populated areas required careful consideration to prevent potential dangers."
121	14954	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to lose control and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flammable gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated NYC the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below. The risks and challenges associated with dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building were significant, making it a difficult feat to accomplish safely."
122	14955	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety and nature. Safety was a concern due to the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles, as demonstrated by the tragic Hindenburg disaster in 1937. This posed a significant risk to the public and the building itself. Additionally, nature presented challenges as the wind currents at the top of the building were unpredictable and subject to violent shifts. These obstacles made it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building.
123	14956	6	3	"Although high expectations were conceived for the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon. The dream of having a mooring mast to dock new airships was quickly halted when architects first discovered the stress that a dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add to the building's fame. As a result, architects had to reinforce the building's framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an obstacle as well. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building. Finally, architects also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be violent, forceful, and unpredictable. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Moreover, the violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" feared that the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell. In effect, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building quietly disappeared. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of this ambitious plan."
124	14957	6	3	The Top of the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid but there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask any functional elements like water towers or air conditioning units. This additional height serves a practical purpose beyond aesthetics, ensuring that the building remains an iconic and imposing structure on the New York City skyline. The architectural design of the Empire State Building incorporates this intentional elevation to enhance its overall presence and maintain its status as a symbol of innovation and grandeur in the city. With this careful consideration of every aspect of its construction, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to the meticulous planning and attention to detail that went into creating one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world.
125	14958	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was the wind. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This made it unsafe for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as the risk of a fire or accident was too great. Despite efforts to overcome these obstacles, ultimately, the safety concerns outweighed the benefits of having dirigibles dock at the iconic skyscraper.
126	14959	6	3	In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt The Mooring Mast, it is discussed how builders faced challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle was the fact that most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable compared to helium. This posed a major risk of fire that could potentially destroy the entire building. Furthermore, the idea of having dirigibles dangling above pedestrians on the street was deemed impractical and unsafe. The safety of people walking below was a crucial concern. Additionally, there was the danger of a dirigible being blown onto the sharp spires of surrounding buildings, not just the Empire State Building itself. This highlighted the potential risk to other structures in the vicinity. The builders had to navigate these challenges to ensure the safety and functionality of the docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
127	14960	6	3	In the nonfiction article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is mentioned that the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to support the weight of the Mast. Additionally, workers had to consider the impact of nature, such as wind, on any dirigibles or blimps that may be moored there. Furthermore, there were legal restrictions on aircraft flying at low altitudes, adding another challenge for the builders. Despite these obstacles, the builders aimed to make the height of the Mast exceed any other structure. John Tauranac announced that the Empire State Building would reach 1,250 feet, with the top serving a higher purpose. The builders faced a multitude of challenges, from height issues to legal constraints, as they worked to bring the Mooring Mast to fruition.
128	14961	6	3	In the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, obstacles faced by the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant engineering challenges. One major issue was that the building had already been completed before the idea of dirigible docking was considered, requiring substantial modifications to the existing structure. Additionally, the question of how the airships would remain secured next to the building posed a complex problem. Furthermore, the legal restrictions on dirigibles being in close proximity to buildings added another layer of difficulty, considering the safety risks associated with their flammability and potential danger to individuals in the event of a crash. These various factors made it a challenging endeavor for the Empire State Building to incorporate dirigible docks, as depicted in the novel.
129	14962	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock are significant. The sheer weight of the dirigibles would create immense pressure on the building, potentially causing it to collapse. Transmitting the load and wind pressure all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below, posed a major challenge. Moreover, the costly modifications required, totaling over sixty thousand dollars, added to the complexity of the project. The limited space in densely packed New York City further complicated the construction of a suitable dock for the dirigibles. With some dirigibles being as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to four city blocks, finding a suitable location proved to be a daunting task for the builders. These obstacles highlight the immense challenges faced by the Empire State Building in its endeavor to accommodate dirigibles for docking."
130	14963	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One obstacle they faced was that the building's frame would have to be modified. This was because the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building when docked on it. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it dangerous for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea, there were too many obstacles and dangers involved in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Despite the initial vision of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the numerous challenges and risks ultimately made it an impractical and unsafe endeavor."
131	14964	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most apparent problems was its urban location with a high volume of pedestrians walking the streets, posing a safety hazard if dirigibles were to fly overhead. Additionally, the risk of a disaster like the German dirigible fire was a major concern, as it could have resulted in casualties and significant damage to the building. The significant construction and financial investments required to modify the Empire State Building to accommodate dirigibles also presented a challenge. Ultimately, these unforeseen issues led to the failure of the mooring mast as originally planned.
132	14965	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. So in order to strengthen the frame it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The last obstacle was safety because of an accident took place in downtown New York it would be devastating. Moreover, the logistics of maneuvering a dirigible in a busy city environment posed additional risks and complications. All these factors combined to make the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building a complex and potentially dangerous endeavor. Ultimately, the builders had to weigh the benefits against the risks and costs involved in order to make an informed decision.
133	14966	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety, as most dirigibles outside of the US used highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium. Another issue was the impracticality and safety concerns of the dirigible swiveling around if tethered to the mooring mast. Additionally, a law against airships flying too low made it illegal for ships to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Despite attempts by some dirigibles to reach the building, there was no success in overcoming these obstacles.
134	14967	6	3	"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished."
135	14968	6	3	People in the past did not realize the impracticality of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building due to various obstacles faced by the builders. One major challenge was the use of highly flammable hydrogen in the dirigibles, posing a significant risk to the city. Additionally, the strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult to bring the airships close to the mast. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas like New York City. These obstacles made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Thankfully, with the advancement of technology, airplanes and airports have provided more efficient and safer means for aviation, making the idea of dirigibles docking on the iconic building obsolete.
136	14969	6	3	"Builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add a lot of stress on the building's frame. Another big obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Over $1 million would be needed for this to happen. Additionally, the unique design of the building itself posed a challenge as there were no existing structures to model the docking system after. Despite these obstacles, the builders were determined to find a solution to make dirigible docking a reality atop the building. With careful planning and innovative engineering, they were able to overcome these challenges and create a safe and efficient docking system for dirigibles. Ultimately, their hard work and perseverance paid off, and the dirigibles were able to dock successfully, opening up new possibilities for transportation and travel in the city."
137	14970	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. One major concern was the use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, in the dirigibles outside the building. This posed a significant safety risk, especially considering the densely populated area of downtown New York. The owners of the Empire State Building were aware of the potential dangers, as highlighted by the possible catastrophic consequences if an accident were to occur over the city.  In addition to the flammability issue, natural elements also presented challenges. The violent air currents around the Empire State Building made it difficult to control the dirigibles during the docking process. This unpredictable factor added another layer of complexity to the already risky operation.  Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. This legal barrier further complicated the situation and reinforced the impracticality of docking dirigibles above a heavily populated city like New York.  Overall, the combination of safety concerns, natural obstacles, and legal restrictions made it clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building would be a challenging and potentially hazardous endeavor.
138	14971	6	3	"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building builders faced an onslaught of problems that should have been easy to pick up on. Everyone got caught up in the hype in my opinion. Outside of the U.S., other dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Winds also played an obstacle in the construction. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles would not be able to tie to the dock and stay because of violent air currents. There was a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...,"". Finally, times changed and planes became the new fad for air transport, ending dirigibles run as the main provider. This shift marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in aviation history."
139	14972	6	3	The builders ran into quite a few problems when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium; and hydrogen is highly flammable. This would mean that if a docked dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire it would burn down the Empire State Building and much of the city, killing many people with its explosion. Another main obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds would make it almost impossible for a dirigible to reach the mast and actually dock. In addition, the dirigible would be swinging around violently once it was tied to the mast. The third major problem was the law against aircraft flying low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. With the law in the way, no one would even want to try. These three major problems posed significant challenges during the construction of the mast on the Empire State Building, ultimately preventing dirigibles from docking successfully.
140	14973	6	3	The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were significant. In addition to accommodating passengers and establishing new routes, they also had to contend with the forces of nature. The building had to be taller to accommodate passengers, which required additional structures to be added on top. This made the building more susceptible to violent air currents, posing a risk to both the structure and its inhabitants. Additionally, the dirigible mooring mast on top of the building added weight and further complicated the construction process. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and determination in the face of adversity.
141	14974	6	3	There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp.
142	14975	6	3	The engineers faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building. One significant issue was the stress of the dirigible's load on the building's foundation, requiring costly modifications and strengthening of the steel frame at a price of sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, the blimps would not remain stationary while docked due to strong winds, prompting the placement of weights at the back of the landing fields. However, these weights posed a danger as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. Despite these challenges, the engineers persevered in finding solutions to ensure the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
143	14976	6	3	"When building the Empire State Building, builders were faced with several obstacles in their attempts to have dirigibles dock there. The builders first had to ensure that the building was going to be able to support the dirigible. After they completed this issues relating to safety arose. It was very dangerous to because some air ballons were made out of hydrogen which were flammable. If their were any issues, New York's population could be in grave danger. The wind also was an issue ... because it was so shifty a dirigble would be heavy in the back. Dangling above new york was very dangerous. The last complications that affected the idea of docking the drigbles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area."" because of the law, safety and nature complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
144	14977	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles of constructing the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock were significant. One practical reason for dirigibles not being able to moor there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to approach the building for docking. Additionally, the lack of landing area in New York City posed a challenge for dirigibles looking to land. The weather was another obstacle, as it could cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Weighting down the dirigibles with lead weights, as was done in open landing fields, was not practical or safe in the urban setting. These obstacles made it difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, despite efforts to make it feasible.
145	14978	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof..."" because it ""would add stress to the building's frame"", resulting in modifications to the building's frame. Another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to nature. As dirigibles use ""hydrogen instead of helium"", there was a great risk of fire, especially above New York City. The wind was also a problem, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would have to be weighed down by lead, which was not feasible in New York City. A final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. The builders faced the issue of existing law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" This made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. All these challenges made it incredibly difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to accommodate dirigibles, showcasing the complexities of integrating such technology into urban landscapes."
146	14979	6	3	Some of the problems faced in building the Empire State Building included the height of the structure. Constructing a building of such great height, especially with plans for it to accommodate dirigibles, posed a significant challenge. The potential impact of a dirigible against the building could lead to its collapse. Therefore, the contractor had to redesign the skeleton of the building to ensure its stability and safety. By reshaping the structure, they were able to address the concerns related to the building's height and its ability to withstand potential impacts from dirigibles. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building was successfully completed and remains an iconic symbol of architectural and engineering achievement.
147	14980	6	3	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders faced numerous conflicts in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One major concern was safety, as dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, posing a risk to those on the street and within the building. Additionally, the unpredictable and strong winds at the docking location presented a significant obstacle, with the passage highlighting the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited aircraft from flying too close to residential areas, further complicating the feasibility of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building. These challenges collectively posed significant barriers to the successful implementation of the mooring mast for dirigibles at the iconic skyscraper."
148	14981	6	3	Al Smith, a former governor of New York had a brilliant idea to make the empire state building, the tallest building in the world. He would put a mooring mast on the top to allow dirigibles to dock at the top so passengers could disembark. However, this plan faced several challenges. Firstly, the stress of the dirigible's load against the wind pressure would have to be carefully managed all the way down to the building's foundation to prevent structural damage. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that would pose a significant risk to the city below if a mishap were to occur. Furthermore, existing laws restricted airships from flying too low in urban areas, creating legal obstacles for the project. Despite the ambitious vision, these practical concerns ultimately prevented the mooring mast idea from being realized on the Empire State Building.
149	14982	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, many obstacles were faced during the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City. Efforts to add a mooring mast for dirigibles were unsuccessful, with thousands of dollars spent on futile modifications. Safety concerns were a major obstacle, with the realization of the potential disaster that could occur above a densely populated area like downtown New York after a dirigible fire in New Jersey in 1937. Additionally, existing laws prohibited low airships in urban areas. The unpredictable winds also posed a significant risk to workers during construction. Despite these challenges, dirigibles were never docked on the building, highlighting the insurmountable obstacles faced during the project."
150	14983	6	3	The Empire State Building faced several major problems in making a station for dirigibles to dock. One is that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind from landing or docking in a residential area, let alone a densely populated city. Additionally, there were many practical issues with the mast itself. It would have been a monumental task to get the huge airships docked and to keep them there, not to mention the extreme flammability of the hydrogen gas that zeppelins were often filled with. The risks associated with having such flammable airships in close proximity to a heavily populated urban area would have been too great to ignore. Ultimately, the challenges and safety concerns proved to be insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the idea of a dirigible station at the Empire State Building.
151	14984	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. One major challenge was the unpredictable weather conditions, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another significant hurdle was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which posed a legal barrier to the project. Additionally, the issue of safety was a concern, as allowing dirigibles to dock would mean they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was deemed neither practical nor safe. These obstacles made the task of enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building a complex and challenging endeavor.
152	14985	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building had to face the obstacle of safety, to make sure everyone can get on the dirigible safely without any form of danger. Another obstacle is arranging the dirigibles so that they are able to board passengers from there. @PERSON1 said ""the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gears."" People did'nt want to try it, so that would be another obstacle. If people did'nt want to try it then it will become just a decoration, and that's not what Al Smith wanted. Last obstacle would be that it would'nt hold for long as said in the excerpt ""The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" In other words, the architects did'nt think to far a head into the future to see if the mooring mast would even be used. These are some of the obstacles that the builders had to face."
153	14986	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation. This adjustment allowed for a more stable structure that could support the additional weight of the dirigible without compromising the safety of the building or its occupants.
154	14987	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building without compromising its structural integrity. To address this issue, architects had to make significant modifications to the building's framework, which involved substantial costs. Additionally, the safety of the public below was a crucial concern, given the highly flammable nature of the hydrogen used to inflate dirigibles. The risk of a potential explosion over New York City posed a serious threat to countless lives. Furthermore, the unpredictable and violent air currents surrounding the Empire State Building presented another obstacle. Even if a dirigible could be secured to the roof, the shifting winds could create dangerous conditions for those below. Despite these challenges, the builders were ultimately unable to overcome these obstacles and implement a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
155	14988	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the frame of the building. They had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work. Another obstacle was safety, as dirigibles use highly flammable hydrogen to power them. This posed a great risk of catching on fire when flying over such a densely populated area as New York. Additionally, the conditions at the top of the building, including violent winds, would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Moreover, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal to even fly up to the Empire State Building. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used.
156	14989	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there due to safety concerns and the unpredictable nature of the wind. The dirigibles' use of highly flammable hydrogen gas made it too risky to have them land on the building's flat roof. Additionally, the constant changes in wind direction and speed posed a significant obstacle, as the dirigibles would be floating above pedestrians once moored. Ultimately, the plan to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building for dirigibles was deemed unfeasible due to these factors.
157	14990	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had solved the problems of dirigibles having no where to land. However, having the building as a place for dirigibles to dock proved to be much harder than it seemed. First, the balloon would cause too much stress to the building's frame. The author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Also, because this frame would need to be modified, a lot of money would need to be spent. The author states, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). It was too risky to invest on such an unsure project. Also, they realized how dangerous any accidents could be over such a populated area. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). If anything had happened, a very large part of New York could have suffered. Although the plan of creating a mast for dirigibles was impressive, it was neither logical financially, or logical for saftey reasons. Moreover, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building faced challenges due to the lack of suitable infrastructure for maintenance and refueling. Additionally, the noise and disturbance caused by dirigibles landing and taking off in a busy urban area like New York City would have been disruptive to residents and businesses. In conclusion, while the concept of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station was innovative, the practicality and safety concerns ultimately made it an unfeasible idea."
158	14991	6	3	During the Building of the Mast, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast, lots of stress would be added to the building's frame, necessitating strengthening modifications before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to tether the blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide-open fields where weights could be placed in the front and back of the blimp for proper securing. However, with the blimp being attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp, posing a safety concern for tying the blimp down. Additionally, the challenge of docking the blimp arose due to the high winds on top of the building, making it impossible to dock the blimp unless the weather was perfect. These combined issues rendered the mast unusable for dirigibles, highlighting the complexities and limitations faced during the construction process.
159	14992	6	3	Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame. Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the empire state. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge as dirigibles required a flat surface for landing, which was lacking on the building's pinnacle. Furthermore, the unpredictable weather conditions in New York City, including sudden gusts of wind, would have made it extremely hazardous for dirigibles to attempt to dock on the skyscraper. Ultimately, these combined factors made it clear that docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
160	14993	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The dirigibles would have added stress to the frame of the building, requiring costly modifications and strengthening. Over sixty thousand dollars were needed to moderate the weight of the dirigibles on the building. However, the greatest obstacle was nature itself, as the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These challenges made it difficult for the builders to successfully implement a docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
161	14994	6	3	"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking. Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public. Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed."
162	14995	6	3	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mast was not used as much as the builders thought. Ultimately, despite the challenges faced, the construction of the mooring mast added a unique feature to the Empire State Building, even if its practical use was limited by the restrictions imposed by the new law."
163	14996	6	3	The builders faced several challenges while constructing the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock. One such obstacle was the presence of only a single cable tether, which would have added stress to the building. To address this issue, they decided to modify the frame and reinforce it. Additionally, acquiring the necessary equipment posed another hurdle, leading them to seek information from the air station. Moreover, the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of Helium, making them highly flammable and requiring careful consideration. These challenges encompassed building modifications, safety concerns, and potential hazards that needed to be navigated to successfully accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
164	14997	6	3	When the Empire State building was built the workers were trying to find new ways to top the structure. They had suddenly found some problems with one being the top of the Empire State building. Workers had tried to figure out how they were going to put a Dirigible on top of the building so that they could be able to pick up people and drop them off up there, but there were different problems. One issue was the strong winds at such a height that could affect the stability of the Dirigible. Additionally, the weight of the Dirigible and the potential impact on the building's structure needed to be carefully considered. Despite these challenges, the workers persevered and eventually found a solution that allowed for the safe placement of the Dirigible on top of the iconic Empire State building.
165	14998	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building's mast were confronted with many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, the builders had to compensate for the stress a docked airship would place on the building. According to @CAPS1, ""the stress... would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" As a result, the building's steel frame would need to be modified to accommodate the load. Another obstacle faced by the builders were the weather conditions at that height: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Any airship attempting to dock there would be violently buffeted around by the wind. Finally, there was the obstacle of safety. As @CAPS1 states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" @CAPS3 of a Hindenburg-type accident over a densely populated area gave pause to the builders. In conclusion, the builders had to face several huge obstacles, which combined eventually doomed the project. The challenges of managing stress on the building, unpredictable wind patterns, and safety concerns regarding flammable hydrogen all contributed to the project's ultimate failure."
166	14999	6	3	In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below. These challenges required innovative solutions to ensure the safety and structural integrity of the Empire State Building while accommodating dirigibles.
167	15000	6	3	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigibles built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An additional problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigible's back end swivel around the mooring mast, as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Consequently, it would be illegal for a ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
168	15001	6	3	"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start. The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in the original text, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Modifications would have to be made to the entire building. Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building. As described in the original text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible. These obstacles baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely. The impracticality of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was evident, and the challenges proved insurmountable, leading to the ultimate abandonment of the ambitious endeavor."
169	15002	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. The foundation of the building would have to be modified to handle the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would need to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Additionally, the height of the building meant that the dock would be constantly moving due to the strong winds, making it difficult for a dirigible to attach itself. Ultimately, despite the efforts of the builders and architects, the dock for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not meant to be due to the various challenges it presented.
170	15003	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced various obstacles in creating the docks for dirigibles at the Empire State Building. One major challenge was the absence of a suitable landing area in New York City. This hindered the expanded use of dirigibles in the area. Additionally, a potential issue could arise from the time-consuming process of fueling up the dirigibles, potentially causing congestion and delays with other airships. Despite these obstacles, the builders managed to find solutions and successfully implemented the use of dirigibles without encountering significant problems."
171	15004	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, she describes the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three main obstacles they encountered were the lack of a suitable landing area, the need to reconstruct the building's framework, and a law prohibiting such activities. Dirigibles are massive steel-framed balloons with cotton fabric envelopes, filled with hydrogen and helium to aid in their buoyancy. Due to their size, some over one thousand feet long, finding a suitable landing spot proved challenging. Adding a mooring mast to the building's flat roof was not a feasible option as it would place excessive stress on the structure. Additionally, a significant investment of over sixty thousand dollars would be required to reinforce the building's framework to support the weight of the dirigible. Furthermore, existing legislation prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, rendering any potential docking station useless. Despite the allure of having a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, the obstacles of finding a suitable landing area, reinforcing the framework, and legal restrictions proved insurmountable for the builders."
172	15005	6	3	There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone below. The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents. Even if tethered down, the ship would swivel around the tower getting tangled. In conclusion, the idea had to be dropped, though some ships have tried to dock there.
173	15006	6	3	"I've been to the Empire State Building before, right up to the top. The top was not opened, but several windows were, and our thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. Trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible I was waiting for that factor to come up the whole story, and it finally did. ""The winds on top of the building work constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" In addition to parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang-plank, which would not be too fun. Another problem they faced was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" I would think that before spending money on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law-wise. When I read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start.  Furthermore, the logistics of navigating a blimp to land on top of a building in such turbulent winds would be a monumental challenge. The safety of passengers getting off onto a swaying gang-plank would also be a major concern. It is evident that the obstacles facing this project were numerous and formidable. In conclusion, attempting to park a blimp on top of the Empire State Building was not only impractical but also legally prohibited, making the project destined for failure from the outset."
174	15007	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Another challenge that needed to be addressed was the issue of wind. The Empire State Building was already susceptible to strong winds due to its height, and the addition of a dirigible would only increase the potential impact. Additionally, the logistics of refueling a dirigible at such a height presented a significant challenge, as safety measures had to be put in place to prevent accidents. Despite these obstacles, the idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was a testament to the ambition and innovation of the time.
175	15008	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted talks about The Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building of how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used @CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It meant that the building could catch on fire and whole downtown New York. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building However, through innovative solutions and careful considerations, the challenges surrounding the construction of The Mooring Mast were eventually overcome, allowing for the successful completion and utilization of this iconic landmark in New York City."
176	15009	6	3	"The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains the challenges faced during the construction of the Empire State Building in New York. The original plan to build a docking mast for dirigibles on the building was met with various obstacles. Al Smith, the creator of the plan, did not anticipate the complications that came with such a project. The need to strengthen the building's frame to handle the dirigible's load and wind pressure cost over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was a major concern, as dirigibles often used flammable hydrogen, posing a risk over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Additionally, shifting winds and existing laws against low-flying airships added to the challenges faced by the builders. This excerpt emphasizes the importance of considering potential obstacles before undertaking a large project."
177	15010	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included accidents occurring over densely populated areas and the challenge of dealing with violent air currents that constantly shifted. These factors made it difficult to ensure the safety of dirigibles attempting to dock at the building. Accidents over populated areas posed a significant risk to the people below, while unpredictable air currents could make it dangerous for dirigibles to approach and dock at the building. These obstacles highlighted the complex nature of incorporating dirigible docking facilities into urban skyscrapers like the Empire State Building. Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building worked to find solutions that would allow dirigibles to safely dock at the iconic structure.
178	15011	6	3	The idea to put a mast on top of the Empire State Building was initially seen as a brilliant solution to the lack of suitable landing areas for dirigibles in New York City. However, the practicality of docking dirigibles on the mast was quickly called into question. One major concern was the highly flammable nature of the hydrogen gas used in many dirigibles. The tragic destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of docking such airships on a skyscraper in a densely populated urban area. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low or over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of using the mooring mast for dirigibles. Furthermore, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it an unstable and unsafe location for docking airships. In conclusion, while the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building seemed innovative, practical considerations and safety concerns ultimately made it an unfeasible concept.
179	15012	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many problems. One of these problems was the buildings frame. The frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast. Another huge obstacle was safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to go up in @CAPS1 not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload. These were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.  To address these challenges, engineers had to carefully consider the structural integrity of the building and the potential risks involved with using hydrogen as a lifting gas. Reinforcing the frame and implementing safety measures were crucial steps in ensuring the successful docking of dirigibles. Despite the obstacles faced, the architects persevered in their efforts to make the Empire State Building accessible to these airships, demonstrating innovation and determination in the face of adversity."
180	15013	6	3	In addition, the builders discovered that the Empire State Building's height posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock. The strong winds at such heights made it difficult for the airships to stay steady and could potentially push them off course. Furthermore, regulations required aircraft to maintain a certain altitude while flying over the city, making it impractical for dirigibles to dock at the building's peak. Ultimately, these factors led to the abandonment of the initial plan to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building.
181	15014	6	3	The Empire State Building was planned to be the world's tallest building, surpassing even the Chrysler Building under construction nearby. The top of the Empire State Building was intended to serve a practical purpose in the age of dirigibles, with the architects incorporating a mooring mast into the design. This mast had to be carefully integrated into the building's skeleton, requiring adjustments to the original plans. As dirigibles were a focus of research and development by the U.S. Navy at the time, the architects couldn't simply add a mooring mast as an ornamental feature. The addition of this functional element would make the Empire State Building not only a symbol of architectural achievement but also a key player in the era of air travel.
182	15015	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced included the challenge of ensuring the structural integrity of the Empire State Building while accommodating a mooring mast for dirigibles. The stress and wind pressure from the dirigible would need to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, requiring modifications and strengthening of the steel frame. Safety was a major concern, as many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Additionally, the shifting winds on top of the building posed a risk, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. These factors, combined with existing laws against airships flying too low, made the task of adding a mooring mast a complex and challenging endeavor.
183	15016	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were the winds in the high altitudes, the laws that didn't allow airships to be so close to an urban area, the safety of the passengers, and the safety of the pedestrians below. The high altitudes posed a challenge due to the strong winds that could potentially affect the construction process and the safety of the workers. Additionally, regulations prohibiting airships from flying too close to urban areas required careful planning to ensure compliance while maintaining progress on the building. The safety of passengers traveling in airships near the building was a concern that needed to be addressed to prevent any potential accidents. Furthermore, the safety of pedestrians below the building was a priority, and measures had to be taken to ensure that construction materials and equipment did not pose a threat to those on the ground. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State building successfully navigated these challenges to create an iconic structure that continues to stand as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance.
184	15017	6	3	The building was big and beautiful, with intricate architectural details that caught the eye of all passersby. The grand entrance was adorned with elegant columns and a sweeping staircase, hinting at the luxurious interior within. The facade was a harmonious blend of classic and modern design, showcasing the skill and craftsmanship of the builders. As the sun set, the building seemed to glow with a warm, inviting light, drawing people in to admire its grandeur. It was a true masterpiece of architecture, a testament to human creativity and ingenuity.
185	15018	6	3	It was unrealistic and also unsafe of engineers to think that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major problem with the idea that the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Also the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation. Another thing, dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if one of the exploded it would have been a disaster for downtown New York. This is why the idea is neither practical or safe. Additionally, the constant movement of dirigibles coming and going would disrupt the normal functioning of the building and potentially pose a hazard to occupants. Moreover, the unpredictability of weather conditions could further complicate the docking process, leading to potential accidents and damage. Overall, the concept of having dirigibles dock on a building is not only impractical but also poses significant safety risks that could have disastrous consequences.
186	15019	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as violent air currents and the safety of pedestrians when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The shifting winds on top of the building posed a risk of dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast, endangering those below. Additionally, the owners recognized the potential danger to densely populated areas if a disaster like the Hindenburg incident occurred above New York City. These challenges underscored the complexities and risks involved in establishing a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
187	15020	6	3	The Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This building being so tall, and large wind shifts were a constant worry. Wind shifts, is when the direction of the wind shifts suddenly. One minute its blowing in one direction, the next its blowing in another. On May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, people thought about what would have happened if that had occurred over the Empire State building. With New York's large population, the situation would have been chaotic. However, airships weren't allowed to fly that low in the first place.
188	15021	6	3	The task of trying to allow dirigibles to dock 1,250 ft. above ground over the city of New York posed several obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building. Before the dirigibles could attempt to dock on the mast, the builders had to modify the entire building to withstand the stress and pressure from the airships. The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the structure. However, once the modifications were complete, new challenges emerged.  Most of the dirigibles coming from outside the United States were filled with flammable hydrogen, such as the tragic incident involving the German dirigible Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This raised concerns and fears among the builders of the Empire State Building. Additionally, the shifting winds and air currents made it difficult to dock the dirigibles safely. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low to the ground, further complicating the docking process.  Ultimately, due to these unforeseen obstacles and challenges, the idea of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State Building was abandoned. The builders had to rethink their plans and come up with alternative solutions for the docking of airships in New York City.
189	15022	6	3	Based on the information given in the excerpt, there are multiple obstacles they couldn't have been overcome by the builders of the empire state building. Between the winds, problems with ancoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested.One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarilly huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the risk that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in one, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the bimp, then it would cause damage to the city.Lastly, a new law was undergoing a legislation process. It prohibited the flying of any air travel bellow a certain Feet in residential areas. Moreover, the challenge of anchoring the dirigibles securely to the Empire State Building posed a significant concern, as any instability could lead to disastrous consequences for both the airship and the building itself. Despite the grand vision of utilizing dirigibles for transportation, the numerous obstacles, including the wind currents, flammability of hydrogen, sharp spires, and legal restrictions, ultimately made it unfeasible for the Empire State Building to serve as a hub for air travel.
190	15023	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop it. One major obstacle was safety, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the area used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The owners quickly realized how dangerous an accident would be ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second major obstacle was nature; ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". A thousand-foot dirigible moored atop the building would add enormous stress to the frame of the building. In the end these two obstacles would be too great. Times were changing and with the airplane taking over modern travel the dirigible and the mooring mast were doomed. The idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned due to safety concerns and the impracticality of the design in the face of advancing technology."
191	15024	6	3	The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast were numerous. The top of the building had to be modified to serve as a mooring mast, requiring adjustments to the steel frame of the structure. Additionally, the construction of a docking and ticketing area added to the cost and complexity of the project. Concerns about the safety of the dirigibles, particularly in the event of a collision or fire caused by the hydrogen gas used for lift, were paramount. The unpredictable and violent winds near the building posed a significant obstacle, as did regulations prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. The potential for disaster if the dirigible's shell were to rupture and endanger the public further compounded the risks involved in allowing these airships to dock at the Empire State Building.
192	15025	6	3	When building a structure as big as the Empire State Building and even having it dock a Dirigible to the top of it means there will be challenges to face. In order for it to dock, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The building would have to be able to withstand these additional forces. All these problems must be taken into consideration. This would mean spending more money on ensuring the structural integrity and safety of the building. It is crucial to address these challenges and come up with effective solutions to successfully dock a Dirigible to the Empire State Building.
193	15026	6	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they had great intentions but faced some obstacles along the way. This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame. All of the stress would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, so they would have to modify and strengthen the steel. This would cost over $1 million, and that's a lot. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the wind up at the top was constantly shifting. This wouldn't be safe either. There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire. The main obstacle for the builders was safety when they were building this, there were many unsafe outcomes so it was too risky to construct. Additionally, the sheer size and weight of dirigibles posed a challenge in terms of maneuverability and landing accuracy. Furthermore, the logistics of coordinating air traffic and ensuring the safety of both the dirigibles and the building's occupants would have been a monumental task. In conclusion, while the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ambitious, the numerous obstacles and safety concerns ultimately made it an unfeasible and risky endeavor.
194	15027	6	3	Another challenge faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles that would potentially dock at the mooring mast. Hydrogen is highly flammable, making it unsafe to have such airships in close proximity to a densely populated city. This led to the passing of a law that prohibited the transportation of dirigibles near the public, ultimately rendering the mooring mast unusable. Additionally, adverse weather conditions, such as high-speed winds, posed a threat to the dirigibles attempting to dock at the building. To counteract this, lead weights were used to stabilize the airships, but the risk of strong winds causing damage remained. Despite the innovative design of the stainless steel mooring mast, these challenges ultimately led to its abandonment.
195	15028	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety. The hydrogen in them is highly flammable and after the accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened right in New York. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes.
196	15029	6	3	"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the stress added to the building's frame when the dirigible wore it at the top of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to rearrange the frame to make it work. Consequently, the workers were never able to accomplish the goal. Safety was a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building as dirigibles were highly flammable which could have caused a serious accident to occur. However, the ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Since there were heavy air currents above the building, it would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast. There was also an existing law that prohibited planes to fly low over city areas, which of making impossible for dirigibles to reach the building. As a result of all these obstacles, the main goal to dock dirigibles was not achieved."
197	15030	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it. One problem they faced was that if something happened to the dirigible like the Hindenburg, then pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. It was also a problem with passengers because in a city, they could easily crash. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tried to get close enough, it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building.   Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up, wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered, the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast. The final obstacle builders would have to overcome was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles to fly low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building, then they would have been doing so illegally. Additionally, the issue of obtaining necessary permits and adhering to strict regulations posed challenges for builders when trying to navigate through legal obstacles.   In conclusion, the builders of dirigibles encountered various obstacles, including safety concerns, unpredictable weather conditions, and legal restrictions. Overcoming these challenges required careful planning, innovative solutions, and adherence to existing regulations to ensure the safety of both passengers and those on the ground."
198	15031	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel. The builders needed to solve some obstacles that were in their way. First, the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building."" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, $1 million worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure. The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps."" To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the 102nd floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at."
199	15032	6	3	Various obstacles arose during the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One significant challenge was the safety concerns associated with using hydrogen gas in dirigibles, as it is highly flammable. This posed a major risk of the dirigible catching fire while attempting to dock on the building, potentially causing widespread destruction in New York City. Additionally, the builders had to contend with the unpredictable nature of violent air currents at such heights, which could cause the dirigible to veer off course when approaching the mast. Furthermore, there was a legal obstacle to overcome, as there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction meant that even if the builders had successfully navigated the safety and technical challenges, they would still have faced legal barriers to using the mooring mast for dirigibles. Overall, these obstacles presented significant hurdles for the builders in their quest to create the world's tallest building with a functional mooring mast.
200	15033	6	3	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building to accommodate the new station. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, posing a significant obstacle for the builders. Another challenge was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents. This created potential safety hazards if the back of the ship was left dangling over the surrounding streets. These obstacles presented major challenges for the builders in their efforts to make the Empire State Building a landing dock for dirigibles.
201	15034	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were numerous. Safety concerns arose due to the flammability of hydrogen used in foreign dirigibles, making it risky to allow them to dock. The unpredictable nature of air currents near the building made it difficult for pilots to safely land dirigibles. Additionally, existing legislation prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, posing a legal barrier to docking at the Empire State Building. These obstacles ultimately prevented the successful implementation of a mooring mast at the iconic skyscraper."
202	15035	6	3	The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on. This would have taken a long time for landing and fueling, making it a safety concern. Additionally, testing the dirigibles in the testing of the mast would have presented another challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building. Despite these obstacles, the builders were determined to create a docking space for dirigibles, showcasing their innovation and problem-solving skills in the face of adversity.
203	15036	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle was finding a safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area so any type of accident would be horrific, as the owners realized in 1937 when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York City. Another obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong, as it says in sources. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Safety was clearly the biggest concern. Despite the challenges faced, the Empire State Building was eventually completed without a docking station for dirigibles.
204	15037	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building included a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law prevented the possibility of airships tying up to the building due to the risk of being blown onto sharp spires of nearby buildings. Despite an attempted publicity stunt by a dirigible to deliver newspapers to the Empire State Building, the idea of mooring airships to the building was abandoned. The challenges of mooring airships at such heights remained unsolved, leading to the highest observatory dock, meant for passengers, never being opened to the public.
205	15038	6	3	"The builder's main problem with safety. Most Blimps that aren't made in @LOCATION1 are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster like the Hindenburg accident happened while the blimp was moving to the tethers at the Empire State building, the outcome would have been much more disastrous. Another obstacle is the winds. According to the excerpt ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" One final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The builders faced many obstacles by attempting to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building. Additionally, the weight of the blimp and the limited space for maneuvering around the building would have posed significant challenges for the pilots. Despite these difficulties, the builders were determined to find a solution and make docking at the Empire State Building a reality. Ultimately, their perseverance and innovation led to the successful docking of a blimp at the iconic skyscraper, overcoming the various obstacles they encountered along the way."
206	15039	6	3	In addition, the builders had to ensure that the mooring mast was sturdy enough to withstand the forces of the wind and the weight of the dirigible. They also had to consider the safety of the passengers and crew when designing the docking system. Overall, the construction of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building posed several challenges that the builders had to overcome in order to allow dirigibles to dock safely.
207	15040	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles during its construction. One significant challenge was the inclusion of a mooring mast on top of the building. This decision was made to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the world, as desired by Al Smith. However, the construction of the mooring mast introduced various risks. The builders had to consider factors such as weather, wind, and the building's foundation strength. Moreover, the use of dirigibles back then posed a significant hazard, as they were filled with hydrogen. If a blimp were to catch fire while moored to the mast, it could lead to a catastrophic fire that might engulf several city blocks in downtown New York. The potential consequences of this design choice made it crucial for the builders to carefully assess and mitigate the risks associated with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
208	15041	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced many Problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the problems are some blimps are filled with hydrogen wich is highly flammable. If a blimp with hydrogen in it exploded over @LOCATION1 that would not turn out so good For people in New York City. Those people could die. Also one one blimp exploded in New Jersey the blimp had hydrogen in it. So when that happened they thought a lot about the docking station and only to allow blimps with helium in them to dock there. This decision was crucial in ensuring the safety of the people in New York City and preventing any potential disasters that could arise from the use of hydrogen-filled blimps. By only permitting blimps filled with helium to dock at the Empire State building, the authorities took a proactive step in minimizing risks and ensuring the well-being of the city's residents and visitors.
209	15042	6	3	The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was laden with problems ranging from natural preventions to pre-existing laws. During the time of frequent dirigible travel in the world, a German dirigible called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a complication with fire. This catastrophe revealed to the workers a problem they had previously overlooked, the fact that most foreign dirigibles were inflated with flammable hydrogen gas. The idea of a problem like the Hindenburg occurring over one of the most densely populated cities in the world ruled out the idea. The workers of this project also overlooked the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the Empire State Building was anticipated to be the tallest building in the world, the soon-to-be-created mast would still be too close to the millions of people in the city. After test runs had occurred to try out the new mooring system, it was seen that dirigibles were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong winds. The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another building's spire put fear into the minds of the people. The combination of this variety of problems put an end to the idea of using a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the potential risks and logistical challenges associated with dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building far outweighed any potential benefits, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious concept.
210	15043	6	3	Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to design strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. Additionally, the gases used in some dirigibles posed a significant safety risk. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This increased the danger of potential accidents and fires, especially in a densely populated urban area like New York City. Furthermore, the violent air currents could cause the dirigible to sway or require the addition of lead weights, creating a hazard for pedestrians below. On top of these challenges, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction further complicated the feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the combination of structural, safety, and legal obstacles made it difficult for Al Smith and the builders to accommodate dirigibles at the iconic skyscraper.
211	15044	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem that the workers faced was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible... would add Stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). This meant that the frame would have to be Strengthened. Another obstacle they came across was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). Therefore, the it would be illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would be too low down. Finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM3). This made it unsafe and unpractical because the dirigibles would be above pedestrians on the street. Due to all of the complications and challenges that faced the workers who were trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the project was never completed. Despite their best efforts, the obstacles proved too great to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the idea."
212	15045	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. One major obstacle was the safety concern due to the highly flammable nature of the hydrogen used in dirigibles. Another significant challenge was the unpredictable and constantly shifting winds at the top of the building, which caused the back of the airship to swivel around. Additionally, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, posing another hurdle for the builders to overcome. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered in their efforts to create a mooring mast for dirigibles.
213	15046	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One main reason was that it was illegal for dirigibles to dock. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, mother nature prevented dirigibles' ability to dock there. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. However, some dirigibles attempted to dock. In 1930, the U.S. Navy airship, Los Angeles, tried to dock but could not due to the severe winds. New York being a densely populated area posed a significant threat if explosive hydrogen from dirigibles floated low over the city. The destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, highlighted the dangers dirigibles posed. The builders had to modify the frame of the Empire State Building and design a custom mooring device to make the building strong enough to allow dirigibles to dock. Legal and safety problems were a significant challenge for the builders in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
214	15047	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success. Despite the innovative ideas and efforts put into the project, safety concerns and technical challenges prevented the realization of this ambitious vision."
215	15048	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Throughout the excerpt the author states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"" (paragraph 1). Architects and engineers talked with experts about the equipment needed to build the dirigibles and asked people to test them. They had to work on the mooring mast to get the dirigibles to work properly. Getting the mooring mast to work was very difficult for the builders. In paragraph 2, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Dirigibles were basically given up on by the 1930s due to the challenges faced by the builders in making them work with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
216	15049	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. They had to contend with physical challenges such as frames and shapes, as well as non-physical obstacles like nature and existing laws. The violent air currents at the top of the building made it unsafe for blimps to dangle high above pedestrians on the lower level of the street. Additionally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie up a blimp to the Empire State Building itself. These obstacles presented significant challenges for the builders, requiring them to navigate not just physical structures but also political and environmental factors.
217	15050	6	3	"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, we learn about the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the weight and pressure of a dirigible on one tether at the top of the building. This posed a significant challenge as all the stress and pressure from the rope would pull on the building, transmitting the pressure all the way to the bottom of the one-thousand-foot structure. Additionally, the workers encountered difficulties due to nature itself, particularly the high-speed winds around the building that were constantly shifting. If a dirigible were to be tethered at the top with only one rope in the front, the back of the aircraft would be free to move in the wind. This movement could potentially lead to the back of the dirigible hitting the building. Overall, the builders faced numerous obstacles in their ambitious project to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
218	15051	6	3	"In the excerpt ""THE MOORING MAST"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the workers faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow Dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. One of the challenges they encountered was the inability to simply drop a mooring mast onto the building's roof. Additionally, the thousand-foot dirigibles were moored using a single cable tether, which put stress on the building's frame. The workers also had to contend with the shifting winds at the top of the building, as well as the issue of dirigibles being weighted down in the back while dangling above pedestrians on the street. Despite these obstacles, the workers persevered in their efforts to make the mooring mast a reality."
219	15052	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety, and the law. Al Smith, @CAPS1 of New York and headed construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Safety was another obstacle as many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If ignited, a massive accident could occur in New York City. Lastly, the law posed a challenge as there was a regulation stating that ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas,"" making the mooring mast's intended purpose illegal. Today, the mooring mast stands as nothing more than decoration, a reminder of the ambitious plans that faced insurmountable obstacles."
220	15053	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock were insurmountable. The safety concerns surrounding the mooring mast were significant, as dirigibles were predominantly filled with flammable hydrogen, posing a severe fire hazard in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Moreover, the unpredictable and violent air currents at the top of the building made mooring even more perilous. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, rendering it illegal for them to approach or dock at the Empire State Building. These challenges ultimately led to the demise of the idea, preventing dirigibles from becoming the transportation of the future. The numerous obstacles proved too difficult to overcome, sealing the fate of the mooring mast as a failed endeavor."
221	15054	6	3	They ran into a few problems when it came to building this. They realized after that it wasn't that smart or safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102-floor building just by one cable tether. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldn't control mother nature. If it was a really windy day, it would be hard to keep it steady. And if there wasn't enough support on the building frames, then it could potentially collapse. These challenges made the construction of the dirigible docking station a risky and impractical endeavor.
222	15055	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers. The potential risks and dangers associated with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were far too great to ignore, and the decision to abandon the idea was ultimately the right one.
223	15056	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles. Additionally, the strong winds at such high altitudes could make it difficult for the dirigibles to safely dock and could pose a risk to both the airship and the building. The logistics of maneuvering a large dirigible in such a congested urban environment would also be a significant challenge. Overall, while the idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building may seem appealing, the numerous safety concerns and logistical challenges would make it a difficult and risky endeavor.
224	15057	6	3	During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had some obstacles. One of them was how they were going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable; they had no idea. They did not have the knowledge or technology to do such a thing back then.
225	15058	6	3	"There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem that was addressed was the fact that dirigibles all over the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was flammable. This was a problem because on May 6, 1937 a dirigible was destroyed by fire and the owners of the Empire State building relized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place of a densely populated area."" Another potential problem were the strong wind currents on top of the building, as described in the text. The concern was that these strong currents would prevent a dirigible from docking, and could possibly blow it into another building. This could puncture the dirigible's material and cause a horrifying accident. The final obstacle that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that ""airships flying to low over urban areas"" was prohibited. There were many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building. Additionally, the structural integrity of the Empire State Building itself would have been a concern, as it was not originally designed to support the weight and stress of a docking dirigible. These factors combined made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building would have been a risky and potentially disastrous decision."
226	15059	6	3	"In this @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 the builder of the empire State building faced many @CAPS2 during the building of the Empire State building. The @CAPS3 obstacle would be the wind. Because The building was so high And the more up the more Air and wind they had to stop landing or Drop off the dirigible. A dirigible is also a ballon or blump but there different because the dirigibles can be controlled by pappellers. Another reason was the @CAPS4 equpment. They didnt have the right equipment to dock the dirigible. So they @CAPS5 from letting them dock there ever again. They also @CAPS6 to stop it because it's over hundreds of civilians and if something goes @CAPS4 the balloon could fall on the civilizians.Those Are the reasons Why in the @CAPS1-""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 had to face problems with docking ballons. The challenges with wind, equipment, and safety concerns posed significant obstacles to the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complexities of early airship travel in urban environments."
227	15060	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One example is, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the builders realized that hydrogen is flammable, they had to rethink the construction for if there was a fire it would be much more dangerous in a populated area like New York. The chances of people getting hurt or injured are more likely. Another obstacle was, ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building [because] of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This was a major obstacle because the builders would have been violating a law. It would also be very dangerous. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building itself posed a challenge for dirigibles, as strong winds at such heights could make docking and maneuvering difficult and risky. These obstacles ultimately led to the decision to abandon the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ensuring the safety of the building and its surrounding areas."""
228	15061	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the dramatic and shifting winds at the top of the building due to air currents, causing the dirigible's end to swivel around. Another issue was the risk posed to people walking below in New York City. To secure the dirigible, heavy lead weights were necessary, but the danger of a weight coming loose was a concern. Additionally, stationing a dirigible at the Empire State Building risked breaking the law regarding flying airships lingering too low over a city. These challenges made it difficult to successfully implement dirigible docking at the iconic building.
229	15062	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prominent issue; if human lives are at risk, an idea is not likely to be successful. Most foreign dirigibles contain hydrogen, an element that is ""highly flammable"" and posed a threat to not only the passengers but the people at the docking station as well. Another potential obstacle was the violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to blow around freely with the wind. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the dirigible with lead weights was dangerous; lead weights would be left ""dangling high above pedestrians."" A final and very obvious obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre-existing law prohibiting airships that fly ""too low over urban areas."" Even with a safe docking station, landing would be illegal. Although it may have seemed like a feasible plan at the time, the idea of dirigibles docking on the top of the Empire State building was not a safe or practical one. The numerous safety hazards and legal restrictions surrounding the docking of dirigibles on the building made it clear that this plan was not viable."
230	15063	6	3	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay $1 million to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped."
231	15064	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"". This quote by Irving Clavan is saying that there are many problems unsolved because of the height made, making it harder to accomplish. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They're pointing that out because if there is ever a chance of a mess up and it starts to come crashing down, it's coming down on one of the most populated cities in America. These are some obstacles builders have to face."
232	15065	6	3	In The Mooring Mast builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles the builders faced were that they realized hydrogen was very flammable. An example from the excerpt is a German dirigible was caught on fire, the builders then thought how much worse it would of been over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were harsh, and made it hard for landing. It was also a law that airships could not fly low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles. The decision was made to prioritize safety and adhere to regulations, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles.
233	15066	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the potential stress on the building's frame if a thousand-foot dirigible was moored by a single cable tether. Additionally, many dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen, posing a safety risk. However, the greatest obstacle was the unpredictable nature of the winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents. These shifting winds made it difficult to securely moor a dirigible to the mast, as the back of the ship would swivel around, creating further complications. Despite these challenges, the builders worked diligently to find solutions and make the mooring mast a success.
234	15067	6	3	There seemed to be many problems erupting during the making of the dirigibles dock. For one, the Empire State building's natural structure can't handle its weight. Architects had to make a stainless steel tower to support the dirigibles. However, they soon realized the highly flammable nature of helium and hydrogen, posing a significant safety risk. Additionally, the airwaves at the top of the building were found to be extremely violent, further complicating the feasibility of the project. Ultimately, due to the potential for accidents and safety hazards, the idea of a dirigibles dock at the Empire State building was abandoned.
235	15068	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in building a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock on. The first obstacle was the inadequate framework on the building itself because with a mooring mast on top, much stress would be added to the building. It is said that ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" which could also be a cost problem. Secondly, building a mooring mast for dirigibles over densely populated New York City would be extremely unsafe. Dirigibles from foreign countries used hydrogen to keep them afloat, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" Given the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, any fires above heavily populated New York City would have disastrous effects. Next, the worst obstacle the builders faced was the winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Trying to moor a one thousand foot long dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building would be very unsafe because the winds would blow the back of the dirigible, therefore swiveling the ship around the mast. The final obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even if the building of the mast was a success, the law against dirigibles coming too close would prevent the use of it. All these obstacles the builders faced led to the ultimate failure of the mast. Ultimately, the combination of structural limitations, safety concerns, and legal restrictions made the construction of a mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building an insurmountable challenge."
236	15069	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later on. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having the essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would be violating this law. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast. Despite their efforts, the obstacles ultimately rendered the mooring mast unusable for dirigibles, highlighting the complexities and challenges of integrating such a feature into a building."
237	15070	6	3	When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster. Another obstacle was nature. The wind was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging in the wind. If the wind got too strong it could add a lot of stress to the building and it could collapse. One last reason was an actual law. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The mooring dock on the building would have never worked. Additionally, the sheer size and weight of the blimps would have put immense strain on the structure of the Empire State Building, potentially compromising its integrity. Overall, the idea of a mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State Building was not feasible due to various safety concerns and legal restrictions.
238	15071	6	3	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had many obstacles to face. Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than the United States, so they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable so if it caught on fire it would go down in a very populated area. Another obstacle was at that height, the wind was very strong and violent. When tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was there was a law stating that dirigibles can not fly too low over urban areas this made it impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building made it challenging for dirigibles to safely navigate and dock. The combination of these factors ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to use the Empire State Building as a docking station.
239	15072	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was one of safety, most blimps outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle the builders faced, was nature itself. The winds on top of the building are always changing because of dangerous air currents. These winds would cause the rear end of the blimp to move around and around the mooring mast. A third obstacle they faced was a law that aircrafts couldn't fly too low over pedestrian-filled areas. This law makes it illegal to tie up to the Empire State Building. Additionally, the height of the building itself posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock, as the structure was not designed with the necessary infrastructure to accommodate airships. The builders had to consider all these factors in order to find a solution that would allow for the docking of dirigibles at the iconic building. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building remains a symbol of innovation and engineering excellence in the heart of New York City.
240	15073	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their concerns included the added stress on the building's structure, the flammability of the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft, and the high winds at the top of the building. These obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the Empire State Building. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further hindering the possibility of dirigibles approaching the building. Ultimately, the combination of these challenges posed insurmountable barriers to the docking of dirigibles at the iconic skyscraper.
241	15074	6	3	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury. The challenges of safety, swiveling, legal restrictions, and strong winds made it impractical for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
242	15075	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were rational, considering factors such as people's safety, aircraft height limits, and wind conditions. They carefully considered how to safely dock the dirigibles and how to transport passengers to the landing area. One key feature they worked on was the electric winch that connected the dirigibles to the dock. Additionally, they designed a baggage and ticket area to efficiently manage passenger logistics. Prioritizing these aspects ensured a well-rounded and safe docking system for the dirigibles.
243	15076	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top. In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were attempts to board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying close to urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible dock project on the Empire State Building.
244	15077	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The lack of a suitable landing area in New York City posed a major challenge for the engineers. However, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building to serve as a docking station for airships. Despite this vision, the engineers encountered obstacles such as the shifting winds on top of the building caused by violent air currents. These challenges made it difficult to come up with a safe and practical mooring system for dirigibles. Mother nature's unpredictable forces proved to be the greatest obstacle in the endeavor to make the Empire State building a docking hub for airships. Despite the difficulties, the engineers and government officials in Washington continued to work on finding a solution to overcome these obstacles and make dirigible docking a reality at the Empire State building.
245	15078	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the highly flammable nature of hydrogen and helium, especially in light of the Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. They were concerned about the back weight of the ship and feared that wind could blow it into the spires of the building, potentially puncturing the blimp shell. These challenges required careful planning and innovative solutions to ensure the safety and success of the project.
246	15079	6	3	Many obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders put reality before theory in order to pick the safest route in docking a dirigible. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders realize how dangerous it could be putting that risk in such a densely populated area such as New York. The greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would sway the ship around the Mooring, becoming dangerous. The Mooring project came to a halt in the late 1930s, in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe. The risks associated with docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building were too great to ignore, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the project.
247	15080	6	3	In addition to the flammability of hydrogen used by most dirigibles from outside the United States, another significant obstacle faced by the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law was in place to protect the safety of the citizens of downtown New York and prevent any potential accidents or disasters. The combination of these factors made it challenging for the builders to overcome the various obstacles and make the necessary accommodations for dirigibles to dock at the iconic building. As a result, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was ultimately not feasible due to these significant challenges.
248	15081	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such height. Dirigibles, mostly outside of the U.S., were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas which was very dangerous above a highly populated area such as downtown New York City. Safety was a major concern, and an accident like the Hindenburg disaster was something they did not want to risk. The ability to dock a lightweight flyer was also very difficult. With strong winds, after the tether cable was attached, the back end of the aircraft would be blown around, making it hard for the aviator of the blimp to control. Additionally, a law stated that aircraft may not fly too low to buildings, especially after the incident of the Hindenburg in New Jersey. A blimp could possibly hit a spire of another building. The reality of docking these lightweight aircrafts was a major safety and difficult concern that the builders of the empire state building faced.
249	15082	6	3	The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be the tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to put a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, the architects had to change their designs. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. Two months after the workers started with the new plan, they celebrated because they finished framing the entire building. The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety concerns.
250	15083	6	3	There were many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was that the building's frame was not prepared to handle the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top. Over $60,000 worth of modifications would have been needed to accommodate this. Additionally, most countries used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, for their dirigibles, posing a significant safety risk over densely populated areas like New York City. Furthermore, the shifting winds and violent air currents at the top of the building made it nearly impossible to stabilize a tethered dirigible, as lead weights were not a viable solution due to the risk of dropping them over the city. In conclusion, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was deemed impractical and unfeasible due to these various obstacles.
251	15084	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. They had to do this because the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle they had to face they had to add to more floors to the building to make a grand total of 102 floor. The 101st floor was a glassed-in observation area and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. To accommodate the docking of dirigibles, a massive mooring mast was constructed on top of the building, reaching a height of 200 feet. This mast was equipped with lights for visibility and a radio beacon for communication with the dirigibles. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building successfully became a hub for dirigible traffic, solidifying its place in history as an architectural marvel.
252	15085	6	3	The builders that were attempting to build a dock on the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable, posed a significant risk of fire. Additionally, tying down airships to a building was illegal due to existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Furthermore, docking airships to a building was deemed unsafe as the wind could potentially blow them into sharp spires of other buildings, causing severe damage. Convincing government officials to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building would be a challenging task due to the numerous safety concerns. In conclusion, the risks and safety hazards associated with docking airships on the Empire State Building outweigh any potential benefits.
253	15086	6	3	There is a lot of obstacles in trying to come with an idea of a building. They had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of the high winds it was going to get. Plus, they also had to make sure the top was safe enough for the dirigibles to dock there without harming any people or the building. Additionally, they needed to consider the weight and size of the dirigibles to ensure that the building could accommodate them safely. Moreover, the materials used in the construction had to be lightweight yet durable to withstand the stresses of both the wind and the docking process. All these factors had to be carefully evaluated and integrated into the design to create a successful and functional building that could meet the unique challenges it would face.
254	15087	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"". They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land. Second, ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldn't break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" If they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower. Overcoming these challenges was essential for the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
255	15088	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock are highlighted. The greatest challenge encountered was the unpredictable nature of the climate and winds at the building's height. This constantly changing environment posed a risk as the back of the dirigibles could swivel dangerously. Additionally, the prevalent use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles raised concerns about the potential for a catastrophic explosion, especially considering the building's location in densely populated New York. The builders of the Empire State Building had to navigate these obstacles to ensure the safety of the dirigibles and the lives of those in the vicinity."
256	15089	6	3	As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first obstacle was the need for a sturdy framework to withstand the harsh winds that constantly pushed the blimps in different directions. Without a strong frame, docking would be extremely dangerous. The next challenge was the flammable hydrogen gas used to power the dirigibles. Previous accidents with hydrogen blimps raised concerns about the safety of docking them on the building. The final obstacle was the strong wind currents at that altitude, making it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to dock safely. Workers suggested using weights to stabilize the blimps, but this posed a risk to pedestrians below. Despite the initial idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the obstacles proved too great to overcome, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the plan.
257	15090	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the safety of the people in the dirigibles and those below them was a crucial concern for the builders. Any potential risks had to be carefully considered to ensure the safety of all involved. Additionally, nature presented significant obstacles, such as the challenge of wind affecting the dirigibles' ability to reach the mooring mast safely. The idea of the mooring mast itself seemed impractical, as it was primarily conceived as a competitive measure rather than a well-thought-out solution. Ultimately, the feasibility of the mooring mast was called into question due to its potential risks and the challenges posed by nature.
258	15091	6	3	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Despite these challenges, they persevered in their efforts to create a docking solution that would be both safe and practical for the dirigibles of the time.
259	15092	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles, there were also concerns about the safety of using hydrogen gas as a lifting agent. Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk if a dirigible were to catch fire while docked on top of the building. This raised serious concerns about the potential for a catastrophic accident over the densely populated area of downtown New York City. Furthermore, the constantly shifting winds on top of the building presented another obstacle to the safe docking of dirigibles. The violent air currents could cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, making it difficult to secure the airship in place. These additional challenges added to the complexity of the project and highlighted the many obstacles that had to be overcome in order to make the Empire State Building a suitable location for dirigible docking.
260	15093	6	3	Allowing dirigibles as a new form of transportation in the 1920s was met with various challenges, particularly in terms of safety. One major issue was the flammability of the gases used to lift the dirigibles. The risk of a spark causing a catastrophic fire, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, made docking at structures like the Empire State Building dangerous. In addition, strong winds could cause the dirigibles to sway uncontrollably around the mooring mast, posing a threat to nearby pedestrians. Weighted down by lead weights, the dirigibles had limited stability in adverse weather conditions. These concerns highlighted the impracticality and risks associated with using dirigibles for urban transportation, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
261	15094	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in constructing the mooring mast. One major challenge was the law prohibiting airships from flying too low over city areas, which directly conflicted with the builders' plans for the mooring mast. Additionally, the danger posed by the sharp spires of surrounding tall buildings posed a significant risk to the dirigibles docking at the mast. The potential catastrophic consequences of an airship accident in a densely populated city like New York, as exemplified by the tragic Hindenburg crash, ultimately led the builders to abandon their ambitious project due to the numerous safety concerns and risks involved.
262	15095	6	3	In the expert, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to accommodate dirigibles. The fabric used for dirigibles was incredibly lightweight, consisting of cotton filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than hair. Despite the efforts made, it was suggested that the architects did not fully commit to resolving the issues at hand. As a result, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was deemed incapable of fulfilling its intended purpose.
263	15096	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to include a dirigible dock. The dock would have violated existing laws and posed a significant danger to the people below. Furthermore, the addition of a dirigible dock would have put undue stress on the frame of the building. Ultimately, these challenges made it unfeasible to proceed with the construction of a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building.
264	15097	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the strong winds in the area, which made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the building safely. For example, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough due to the powerful winds, posing a risk of collision with nearby buildings. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even come near it. Furthermore, the use of hydrogen in many foreign blimps posed a significant danger, as hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders were concerned about the potential for a disastrous accident, especially after hearing about a blimp fire in New Jersey. This fear was heightened by the densely populated nature of downtown New York City, raising the stakes for any potential crashes. These obstacles created significant challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles, highlighting the complex considerations involved in airship docking in urban environments."
265	15098	6	3	When constructing the Empire State Building, architects faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One obstacle was the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building. Additionally, the constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, made it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock. These factors contributed to the failure of the mooring mast project.
266	15099	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium make them lighter than air."" The first problem is that it's material could be broken if happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" did not help. Since the dirigibles could not be weighted down at the Empire State Building, it would be dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with hydrogen and helium, ""most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With these obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there, the theory did not work out in reality. The risks associated with the flammable nature of hydrogen and the structural vulnerability of the dirigibles made it impractical to allow them to dock at the Empire State Building."
267	15100	6	3	Furthermore, the size and shape of the dirigibles themselves posed a challenge for docking on the Empire State Building. The building's narrow peak and limited space made it difficult for the massive airships to safely maneuver and dock without the risk of damage or accidents. In addition, the technology and infrastructure needed for a successful docking operation were still in their early stages of development, making it impractical to attempt such a feat at that time. Ultimately, despite the grand vision of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, safety concerns and logistical challenges proved to be insurmountable obstacles, leading to the abandonment of the project.
268	15101	6	3	In addition to these challenges, the architects also had to consider the issue of weight distribution. The dirigibles needed to be evenly balanced to prevent the Empire State building from leaning. Despite these obstacles, the architects were determined to find a solution to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. Through careful planning and innovative engineering, they eventually overcame these challenges and successfully installed a mooring mast on top of the iconic skyscraper. This feat marked a significant achievement in the history of aviation and architecture, showcasing the ingenuity and perseverance of those involved in the project.
269	15102	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in keeping the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind, there were also legal restrictions that hindered the docking of dirigibles on the skyscraper. The law prohibiting airships from flying too low over populated areas posed a significant obstacle for pilots attempting to moor their dirigibles on the building. Furthermore, the difficulty of docking in strong winds further complicated the process, as evidenced by the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles's unsuccessful attempt to tie up at the mooring mast. These combined challenges made it impractical for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of this ambitious idea.
270	15103	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, @CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard to overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accident could have been much worse if it occurred above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast. Additionally, the noise and disturbance caused by dirigibles could have also posed a challenge, as they could disrupt the peace and privacy of those living and working in the surrounding buildings. Overall, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in trying to allow dirigibles to dock were significant and multifaceted, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
271	15104	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, Empire State Building faced many obstacles. One problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium, as hydrogen is highly flammable and caused a dirigible to be destroyed by fire. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a dirigible to stop swiveling around, posing a safety hazard for pedestrians below. Moreover, it was illegal for aircraft of any sort to fly so low over urban areas. Initially well-liked, the idea of the mooring mast ultimately had too many problems and proved to be impractical.
272	15105	6	3	In the 1930s, as new technologies were emerging, one innovative idea was the concept of utilizing the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. However, several significant challenges prevented this idea from becoming a reality. One major concern was safety, particularly the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles from outside the United States. The risk of a potential fire could result in catastrophic consequences for those on board and people on the ground below. Additionally, the unpredictable and strong winds at the building's height posed a considerable obstacle. The constant shifting air currents made it extremely difficult to safely moor a dirigible at such a height. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the idea, the numerous practical challenges ultimately made it impossible to implement.
273	15106	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, describes complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. ""It was planned as the world's tallest building taller even than the new Chrysler Building,"" (@CAPS1). ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building"" (@CAPS1). There was a competition as to had the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle, was the safety and dirigibles. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurts, New Jersey, The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populate area such as down town New York."" (@CAPS1). The owner didn't want to risk a accident to cost people's life it would have been bad rep for them. The obstacles that the builders went through was a positive thing, it made them learn and open their eyes."
274	15107	6	3	"There are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the winds on top of the building were strong and will cause the dirigible will swivel around the mooring mast, if tethered. Also, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the areas."" This shows that it was a waste of time thinking ships could moor at the State Building because there is a clear law against it. Another obstacle that would have been faced is the lack of proper infrastructure to support the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building. The building was not designed or equipped to accommodate the large airships, making it unsafe and impractical for such operations. Additionally, the logistics of maneuvering a dirigible in the congested airspace of New York City would have posed a significant challenge, with the risk of collisions and accidents being high. Overall, while the idea of using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles may have seemed innovative, it was ultimately unfeasible due to a combination of natural, legal, and logistical obstacles."
275	15108	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles that prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstacle was the lack of safety. Dirigibles are highly flammable machines when used with hydrogen, and a fire in New York City would be tragic. Another obstacle that the Mooring Mast faced was the unpredictability of nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with an electric winch, allowing them to move freely. However, when the winds of Nature were to blow on this situation, the dirigibles would ""swivel around & around the mast,"" causing tension to build on the building's frame and leading to a very unsafe environment. The last reason was that there was a law created that stated it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safety reasons, rendering the entire Mooring Mast unusable."
276	15109	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were primarily centered around the design and implementation of the mooring mast. Initially, the challenge was to make the building larger than the Chrysler Building, which led to the innovative idea of incorporating a mooring mast. However, during the design process, it became apparent that simply placing the mast on top of the building would not suffice, necessitating modifications to the foundation and overall structure. Despite overcoming these hurdles and completing the mast, the architects overlooked a crucial detail regarding the flammability of hydrogen, the gas used in most dirigibles. This oversight rendered the mooring mast unusable, despite all the effort and resources invested in its construction. Ultimately, the builders were faced with the disappointing reality that their ambitious project would never fulfill its intended purpose.
277	15110	6	3	There are always challenges when you are trying something innovative. There are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support, and being structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of these architects faced all of these. During the 1920s, dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel. Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. Other than getting people to go along with the plan, he had other problems. The wind is very violent at that altitude. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city as it is dangerous and some were highly flammable. In conclusion, there were too many large obstacles to overcome. Additionally, the logistics of safely landing and securing a dirigible on top of a tall building in a bustling city would have been extremely challenging. The risks involved in such a venture would have been significant, making it a highly impractical idea. Despite the innovative thinking and vision, the idea of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was simply not feasible.
278	15111	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles ran on hydrogen verses helium and if it were to ever to catch on fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because the dirigible would be docked so high with little back control, the fierce winds would be a huge issue. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible were to dock there it would also be breaking laws. ""...was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The builders a lot more obstacles dealing with the docking of dirigibles than just architectural."
279	15112	6	3	"The obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there was they had to build a higher taller building. They also had trouble building it so the workers had to back up the dates. Another obstacle that they had trouble with is the mast. ""The mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. The workers were also not planning on having these many obstacles they just wanted to do the job. The challenges of constructing a taller building and dealing with unexpected obstacles such as the mast caused delays in the completion of the project. Despite the setbacks, the builders remained determined to overcome these challenges and fulfill their goal of creating a docking space for dirigibles at the Empire State Building."""
280	15113	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the empire state face was trying to make sure the building don't fall down. The structural integrity of such a towering skyscraper was crucial, considering the height and weight it needed to support. Engineers and architects had to carefully design and implement a strong foundation, as well as innovative support systems, to ensure the building could withstand the forces of nature and the test of time. Additionally, the materials used in construction had to be of the highest quality to prevent any potential weaknesses or failures. Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building were able to overcome these obstacles and create an iconic structure that has stood tall for decades, serving as a symbol of American ingenuity and achievement.
281	15114	6	3	Some problems that the builders faced building the mast on the top of the building was that the builders couldn't just drop the mast on top of the building's flat roof because then the wind would cause stress to the frame because the blimps could hanging there. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to make the mast. The cost for these modifications were another problem for them two. Additionally, the builders had to consider the weight and size of the mast to ensure it could be safely installed on top of the building without causing any structural issues. Moreover, they had to carefully plan the logistics of hoisting the mast onto the roof and securing it in place to prevent any accidents during the construction process. Despite these challenges, the builders were able to overcome them through careful planning and execution, ultimately successfully completing the project.
282	15115	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would put pressure on the building's fram. To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame. More than sixty thousand dollars' went into the modifications of the framework. The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that. The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift. In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using led weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and found solutions to make the dirigible docking at the Empire State Building possible.
283	15116	6	3	In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the structure. One obstacle that constructors faced was modifications, as the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation. This required reinforcing the frame and foundation to withstand the additional weight and force. Another obstacle was the fact that most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable. This posed a significant safety risk, as a dirigible explosion over the streets of New York would have been catastrophic. These obstacles had to be carefully considered and addressed during the construction process to ensure the safety and functionality of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
284	15117	6	3	In addition to the challenge of adding a mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building also faced obstacles such as the immense weight and height of the structure. The building stood at a remarkable 1,454 feet tall, making it the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion in 1931. The sheer height posed engineering challenges in terms of materials, construction methods, and safety precautions. Furthermore, the weight of the building, including the steel frame and exterior limestone facade, added further complexity to the project. These obstacles required innovative solutions and careful planning to ensure the structural integrity and stability of the Empire State Building. Despite these challenges, the builders successfully overcame the obstacles and created an iconic symbol of New York City that continues to inspire awe and admiration to this day.
285	15118	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles by building the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that Al Smith had competition with the Chrysler building, which was forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. This led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. Another obstacle arose when Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking new airships, but this plan was thwarted by a lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would have been held by a single cable tether, causing undue stress to the building's frame. In conclusion, these obstacles presented challenges in the construction of the Empire State Building, ultimately shaping its design and functionality.
286	15119	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles when the decision was made to use the building to dock, load, and refuel dirigibles. One of the biggest concerns was how to dock a dirigible to the side of the building, but an even greater worry was the amount of stress this would cause. The architects were also troubled by the fear that the wind could blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, as tethering it was not an option due to safety reasons. Ultimately, the inability to overcome these obstacles led to the Empire State Building never being used for its original purpose. Nature, in the form of the wind, proved to be the greatest obstacle to this ambitious project, highlighting the challenges faced when trying to implement innovative ideas in real-world settings.
287	15120	6	3	Furthermore, the lack of suitable landing areas in New York City posed a significant challenge to the expanded use of dirigibles. These airships, some as long as one thousand feet, required ample space for landing, which was scarce in the crowded city streets. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles raised concerns about the highly flammable nature of the gas. The risk of a catastrophic accident in the heart of New York City was a daunting reality that needed to be addressed.  Moreover, the unpredictable and shifting winds on top of buildings added another layer of complexity to the operation of dirigibles in the city. Violent air currents could make navigation and landing even more challenging, requiring careful planning and consideration. In light of these obstacles, a reevaluation of the initial plan was necessary to ensure the safe and efficient operation of dirigibles in New York City.  In conclusion, the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City faced significant challenges related to landing areas, the flammability of hydrogen, and the unpredictable winds on top of buildings. Addressing these obstacles was essential to the success of the operation and the safety of both the airships and the city's residents.
288	15121	6	3	"Builders of the empire state building faced challenging obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock their ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself"" This was a huge problem for the mooring masts because they could not get close enough to the building to land. The winds were too strong. Secondly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" meaning that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircrafts to be that low. Lastly dirigibles from outside of the state used hydrogen rather then helium ""hydrogen is highly flameable"" After the German Hindenburg had an accident with fire it was clear that taking the risk of an accident like that happen above the heads of thousands of pedestrians was a bad idea. The obstacles, which were noticed too late; before the construction, is why the dirigibles are not allowed to land on the Empire State building to this day. Additionally, the use of hydrogen posed a significant safety risk, particularly after the Hindenburg disaster, further solidifying the decision to prohibit dirigibles from docking at the iconic building."
289	15122	6	3	"The obstacles that needed to be overcome to create the idea of a docking platform on top of what was going to be announced as ""The tallest building"" were significant. Consulting with experts and taking tours of equipment and mooring operations at @ORGANIZATION1 in New Jersey were crucial initial steps. However, the stress that the building would endure from the mass of the Dirigibles posed a major challenge during the construction phase. To address this issue, modifications were made to the building's frame to support the new addition. Additionally, a stainless steel tower with a stepped back design was created to complement the overall shape of the building. The project required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast."" Through careful planning, design adjustments, and financial investment, the vision of a docking platform atop the tallest building was successfully brought to life."
290	15123	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the prevalent use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The Hindenburg disaster in 1937 highlighted the potential catastrophic consequences of allowing hydrogen-filled dirigibles to dock above densely populated areas like downtown New York City. The builders also had to contend with unpredictable winds and violent air currents on top of the building, which posed a significant risk to dirigibles attempting to dock. These obstacles underscore the immense challenges that were faced in trying to make the Empire State Building a docking point for dirigibles, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
291	15124	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used flammable hydrogen, making it unsafe to have them above a highly populated area. Additionally, the constantly shifting winds on top of the building would prevent the dirigible from being stable enough to dock. Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie up to the building or even approach the area. With all these factors in place, it was clear that there was never a chance of a dirigible being able to dock at the Empire State Building.
292	15125	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a major concern, especially considering that many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. This posed a significant risk of fire, which could have been catastrophic for the city. Additionally, the violent air currents above the building presented a danger to pedestrians below. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to implement the dirigible plan. With all these challenges, the idea of using dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
293	15126	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included figuring out how to build the mooring mast and how to attach it to the frame of the building. The mooring mast was a crucial feature of the building, designed to accommodate dirigibles, or airships, for docking purposes. This presented a unique challenge as it needed to be both functional and structurally sound. Engineers had to carefully plan and design the mast to ensure it could support the weight and forces exerted by the airships. Additionally, the mast had to be securely attached to the building to prevent any potential hazards. Overcoming these obstacles required innovative solutions and meticulous attention to detail, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the iconic Empire State Building with its distinctive mooring mast.
294	15127	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allow a dirigible to land for several hours. During the time of landing, the dirigible may get refueling or service, and passengers could get on and off safely. Architects had trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were concerned about transmitting the load of the dirigible and wind pressure. Dirigibles, mainly using hydrogen which is highly flammable, faced safety issues. The greatest obstacle for the mooring mast was nature itself, with high winds and violent air currents making it unsafe for dirigibles to land. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to moor at the Empire State Building was the law against airships flying too low. The idea of dirigibles eventually gave way to airplanes. The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were eventually overcome, leading to successful solutions for docking dirigibles at the iconic building."
295	15128	6	3	The architects faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building as dropping a mooring mast on the roof would stress its frame. Strengthening the framework would cost over $1 million, so they designed a tower with a conical roof to house the mooring arm. The tower was made of glass, chrome, and stainless steel, providing an elegant interior for passengers boarding the dirigibles.
296	15129	6	3	The architects and engineers faced obstacles while building the Empire State Building, one being the inability to dock dirigibles due to the lack of a mooring mast. The flat roof design initially prevented the installation of a mooring mast, requiring modification and reinforcement of the building's frame. Additionally, using a rope to support the mooring mast was not feasible as dirigibles could not hold it up. These challenges required careful consideration and innovative solutions to overcome during the construction process.
297	15130	6	3	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was that the winds at that height were always changing and difficult to land a dirigible with. Also, the dirigibles are highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The project was a bad idea from the start. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" They even attempted to try it before they gave up. ""In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It just wasn't made to do that job so it wouldn't work. Additionally, the structural limitations of the building made it challenging for dirigibles to safely dock, as the design was not specifically tailored for such purposes. Ultimately, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building proved to be unfeasible due to various technical and safety concerns, leading to the abandonment of the concept."
298	15131	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building by attempting dirigibles to dock there were too many to predict. The obstacles faced by dirigibles to dock there were because of many variables such as climate, buildings, and most of all the dirigibles themselves. The climate, as mentioned, consisted of dangerous and uncontrollable winds, primarily due to the Empire State Building itself. The urban areas around the building had sharp hull-breaching spires, making a hull breach more likely. Additionally, the construction of dirigibles posed a significant challenge. They were made with a steel frame wrapped in cotton and filled with hydrogen to reduce weight, but the hydrogen was highly flammable, adding to the risks of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
299	15132	6	3	In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to be made. The builders and planners both faced many obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to consult with experts, which meant taking tours and doing research. They had to find a safe way of mooring airships to this mast. The next obstacle was that docking a dirigible to the building would put stress on the building's frame. The builders had to modify and strengthen the frame. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket-shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They also had to house the machinery to winch the dirigible. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes, spend a lot of money, all for something that wasn't even safe in the end. Despite the challenges, the project was a testament to human ingenuity and ambition in the realm of engineering.
300	15133	6	3	"While constructing the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. According to the excerpt the architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. Also having a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would add too much stress on the frame of The building. In order to maintain the dirigible in place it would cost them money. Quoating the article, ""The stress of The The The dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened... sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" The technical and financial issues made it difficult for architects to build a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building. Additionally, the safety concerns for those on the dirigible and the building itself would be significant, with potential risks of accidents or structural damage. Overall, the challenges of implementing a mooring mast were substantial, requiring extensive modifications and resources that posed considerable obstacles for the construction team."
301	15134	6	3	The builders faced a few problems in letting the dirigible dock there. One issue was that most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen, which is highly flammable compared to helium. This posed a significant safety concern. To lower the dirigibles down, lead weights were used, but this method also presented risks to people in the vicinity. These challenges needed to be carefully addressed to ensure the safety of all involved in the docking process.
302	15135	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The steel frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new feature. However, the greatest obstacle was nature itself, with the constant shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents. These factors, along with safety concerns and regulations, ultimately prevented the mooring mast from being put to use.
303	15136	6	3	In addition to safety concerns regarding the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles from outside the United States, the shifting winds atop the building posed a significant challenge for builders. These violent air currents could make docking and maneuvering difficult, especially considering the dirigibles would be suspended high above the bustling streets below. Furthermore, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas added another layer of complexity to the project. Overall, the obstacles faced by builders in allowing dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast were numerous and varied, requiring careful consideration and planning to ensure the safety of both airship passengers and those on the ground.
304	15137	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were significant. The sheer size of the dirigibles, some reaching up to one thousand feet in length, made it nearly impossible for them to safely land on the building. The stress that a dirigible of that size would place on the building's frame, as well as the wind pressure that would need to be transmitted all the way to the foundation nearly eleven hundred feet below, posed serious risks. Despite the architects' attempts, the mooring mast ultimately proved to be impractical and unsafe. The fate of the mast serves as a reminder of the challenges and limitations faced in the construction of such a monumental structure.
305	15138	6	3	"The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem was the harsh wind that high up made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigible, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers"". Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to safety hazards with people getting off of it, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft sso low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not thought out well and was hurried so it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast. In conclusion, the architect faced insurmountable challenges in allowing dirigibles to moor at the top of the building, including harsh winds, safety hazards, and legal restrictions, making the idea impractical and unsafe."
306	15139	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building's mooring mast, the use of hydrogen by most dirigibles from outside the United States posed a significant risk due to its flammability. The shifting winds at the top of the building also presented a problem, causing the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. Furthermore, the violent air currents could potentially blow the dirigible into neighboring buildings, risking damage to the dirigible's shell and the safety of those below. Despite the dangers, laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas and approaching the building made the task even more difficult and risky. The architects and engineers faced a multitude of obstacles in their efforts to create a safe and functional mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
307	15140	6	3	The obstacles the architects of the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included concerns about the safety of people below. This was further complicated by existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, the architects had to contend with the challenge of violently shifting wind currents in the vicinity of the building. These factors collectively posed significant challenges to the feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately shaping the decision-making process surrounding this ambitious project.
308	15141	6	3	The obstacles faced by the Empire State Building included the fact that the balloons were made out of flammable material, and the wind was blowing the dirigible around. These challenges posed a significant risk to the safety of the building and those in the surrounding area. Despite these obstacles, the team working on the project was able to successfully navigate the difficulties and ensure that the Empire State Building was completed without incident. This serves as a testament to their skill and determination in overcoming adversity.
309	15142	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects and engineers wanted the building to be tall and impressive, with a functional top that could accommodate dirigibles. However, they soon realized the dangers of this plan when they discovered the history of accidents involving dirigibles. The shifting winds on top of the building posed a constant challenge, causing the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mask. Ultimately, the builders concluded that allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building would be too risky, considering the safety of the people living in New York City.
310	15143	6	3	According to the Civil Aviation Authority, both the engineers and the architects faced numerous obstacles when trying to construct an area for blimps to land, rendering the project unfeasible. One significant reason for this was the air laws that prohibited flying too low in urban areas. Additionally, strong winds could potentially push the tail of the blimp into sharp spires of neighboring buildings, posing a threat to the dirigible's integrity. These challenges ultimately hindered the development of a safe and practical landing area for blimps in urban settings.
311	15144	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, I have seen how the builders of the Empire State Building ran into obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was already standing when the architects decided to renovate and make a dock for dirigibles. The architects working on this project had to strengthen the building's frame, install winches and control machinery for dirigible mooring, and add housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the base floor and back up. After the renovations, the Empire State Building had 102 floors. However, the owners later discovered that they could not allow dirigibles to dock on the building due to laws prohibiting airships from flying too low in urban areas. Therefore, despite the renovations, the Empire State Building could not be used for dirigibles.
312	15145	6	3	Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach the new height of 1,250 ft on December 11, 1929. His plan was to build a mooring mast, at the top of the building to make it equipped for modern travel. The builders faced three main obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was safety due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in most dirigibles. After the Hindenburg disaster, concerns about a potential catastrophic event in New York arose. The second major obstacle was the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building, which constantly shifted and would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. This issue could only be addressed with lead weights, which was deemed impractical and unsafe. The final obstacle was the law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building. In conclusion, the three main obstacles that the builders faced were safety concerns related to hydrogen usage, challenges posed by the unpredictable winds at the building's height, and legal restrictions on airships flying over urban areas. Despite the ambitious plans for a mooring mast, these obstacles ultimately prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
313	15146	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The lack of space for the massive airships, equivalent to four city blocks in New York, posed a major challenge. Moreover, the need to consult with experts, conduct tours of the equipment, and conduct numerous experiments and tests on dirigibles added to the complexity of the task. The inherent dangers associated with dirigibles, particularly in terms of their flammability due to the use of hydrogen, further complicated the feasibility of allowing them to dock at the iconic building. Ultimately, the instability of the structure and the potential safety risks for individuals prevented dirigibles from being able to dock at the Empire State Building.
314	15147	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solve this problem by modifying the building's framework. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If there was one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast. Ultimately, the challenges posed by the structure and wind dynamics proved too formidable to overcome completely, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking concept at the Empire State Building."
315	15148	6	3	Al Smith had a great idea of having a dirigible station dock on top of the world's tallest building, the Empire State Building. However, there were several challenges that hindered this dream from becoming a reality. Firstly, having zeppelins flying above the urban area of downtown New York City would have posed a significant safety risk to the residents living below. Additionally, the intense winds around the building made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to safely dock on the building's peak. Despite Al Smith's creativity and ambition, these obstacles ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from being used as a dirigible station.
316	15149	6	3	"Some of the things they faced were safety hazards. Like when they said in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the Hindenburg was destroyed they said ""The owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it was over new york."" Another obstacle they faced as they said in @CAPS1 @NUM2 was ""Nature itself."" The winds would make a airship @CAPS3 around like crazy. The last problem was the law stating airships can @CAPS3 that low above urban cities. Furthermore, they had to contend with mechanical failures and the limited technology of the time, which added to the risks and challenges of airship travel. Despite these difficulties, airship pioneers persevered in their quest for innovation and advancement in aviation, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible in the skies."
317	15150	6	3	In the early @DATE1s, dirigibles were seen as the future of transportation. In an attempt to position New York as a pioneer in modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building took on the challenge of constructing a mooring mast, not fully anticipating the hurdles they would face. During the design process, it became apparent that the building's frame was ill-prepared to support the weight of a mooring mast on its flat roof. This necessitated costly adjustments, causing delays and overspending for the city. Furthermore, the impact of wind currents was overlooked. When the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to approach the mooring mast, it was thwarted by strong winds, preventing a successful docking. This serves as a reminder that thorough consideration of potential obstacles is crucial in the planning and execution of large-scale projects like a mooring mast. Such oversights can lead to setbacks, financial burdens, and ultimately, the failure to achieve the intended goals.
318	15151	6	3	"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many challenges facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws.   The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by a reputable source, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable."" The builders realized this posed a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city.   The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor safe."" The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions.   The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building.   In conclusion, the three main challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws. Despite the vision of Al Smith, these obstacles ultimately led to the decision not to proceed with the mooring mast for dirigibles on the iconic building."
319	15152	6	3	"In this project to construct a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were some problems. The idea of the mooring mast was to be able to dock dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building + be able to have passengers get on + off the dirigible from + into the building. The big problem that it faced was the wind speeds that high up in the air. At nearly @NUM1 feet in the air the wind would be whiping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible. When New York governor, Al Smith put forth ideas to construct this mast nobody realized untill after that it was a somewhat rediculous task. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be down to reality. As a result, the ambitious project of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building ultimately proved to be unfeasible and unrealistic in the face of practical challenges like high wind speeds, serving as a valuable lesson in balancing innovation with practicality."
320	15153	6	3	In the excerpt, it talks about making the empire state building the tallest in new york. It was the tallest building until archetectures built the chrysler building. The chrysler building stood 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the empire state building. So Al Smith realized he was gonna loose his tittle for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building.The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about how passangers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of hellium which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example the German blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lake hurst. Al Smith's innovative thinking and consideration for safety ultimately led to the addition of a landing spot for blimps on top of the empire state building, securing its place as the tallest building in New York once again.
321	15154	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was strengthening the building's frame. This was necessary because the added pressure of the dirigible's load and wind needed to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. The existing skeleton of the building had to be edited. In fact, these edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a unique look, architects made the tower out of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the machinery at the base of this tower. The builders also had to make sure it was accessible to passengers; they made sure luggage and people could go to and from the aircraft. These are two of the challenges builders faced is constructing the Empire State Building. Despite the mast being unused in the present day, the design makes this building one of the most well-known buildings in the world. The Empire State Building stands as a testament to the ingenuity and determination of its builders, showcasing a blend of functionality and iconic design that continues to captivate people around the globe.
322	15155	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the harsh winds. The Empire State Building is so tall that the winds were very fast and it would constantly change direction due to violent air currents. This made it very hard to dock the Dirigibles. Also another obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around. Most ballons were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. If a dirigible got caught on fire or crashed, a lot of damage would be done to the city and its people. The structure of the building also proved to be an obstacle. The dirigibles were so large that the buildings structure was at danger of failing and destroying the building. The final obstacle the building faced was the law that made it illegal for a ship to ever tie to a building or even fly that low in an urban area. Although there were a few attempts, the Empire State Building never was able to have dirigibles to dock on it.
323	15156	6	3	"In the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The problems were that the dirigible being ""held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"", and the wind pressure wouldn't help either. Another issue was that, as stated, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"", and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". Additionally, the owners of the Empire State Building realized the potential dangers of an accident, especially if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. These challenges posed significant risks and required careful consideration to ensure the safety of the building and its surroundings."
324	15157	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges with their idea of creating a landing dock for dirigibles. The dirigibles were unable to get close enough to the building to anchor properly, as the point at the top posed a risk of puncturing the balloons. Additionally, the sway caused by strong winds made it dangerous for passengers and pedestrians below. These factors contributed to the impracticality of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station.
325	15158	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many different obstacles. Despite these challenges, the innovative solutions they implemented eventually allowed dirigibles to safely dock at this iconic location.
326	15159	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made."
327	15160	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications on the framewor The greatest obstace of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The architects and engineers had to carefully consider the structural integrity of the building and the impact of wind forces in order to create a safe and functional mooring mast for dirigibles. Despite the challenges faced, they were determined to find a solution that would allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
328	15161	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting dirigibles to dock there. First the stress of ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" was a problem. So the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles. Next, they faced the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Additionally, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents. If you had a dirigible moored and weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians, it could lead to disaster. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders realized too many obstacles interfered and it could never happen. Ultimately, the dangers and challenges posed by the structure and external factors made it clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option."
329	15162	6	3	"In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast,"" the author explains some of the obstacles that the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. The dirigibles were massive, some as long as four New York City blocks, requiring a substantial landing platform for safe docking. Furthermore, the decision to tether the dirigibles with a cable instead of landing them on a flat roof was made to prevent structural damage caused by the weight and wind forces. The challenges encountered by the workers highlight the complexities involved in accommodating dirigibles atop the Empire State Building."
330	15163	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to build a dock for dirigibles. One problem was safety, as dirigibles from other countries used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. If a dirigible were to ignite in a densely populated area like New York City, the result would be catastrophic. Additionally, the unpredictable and strong winds above the building posed a threat to the dirigibles, potentially causing damage or destruction. Finally, federal laws prohibited aircraft from docking so close to a building, further complicating the feasibility of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. These factors combined made it impossible for dirigibles to safely and effectively dock at the iconic skyscraper.
331	15164	6	3	Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with dirigibles dock there were many complications. At the building site, it was discovered that simply putting a mooring mast on top of the building was not feasible. The roof was flat, which meant that adding a dirigible would place additional stress on the building's structure, requiring costly modifications amounting to over $1 million. Furthermore, most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen gas, posing a significant safety risk. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building made it difficult to tether a mooring mast securely. This, combined with the presence of crowds in the urban area below, raised concerns about the safety of using dirigibles. Moreover, existing laws prohibited flying airships too low over urban areas, further complicating the use of dirigibles for docking. Ultimately, despite these challenges, the decision to utilize airplanes instead of dirigibles proved to be a more practical and safer choice for transportation.
332	15165	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght, the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible. Ultimately, the challenges posed by the use of hydrogen, the wind conditions at that height, and the restrictions on airship flights over cities made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
333	15166	6	3	Al Smith, architect of the Empire State Building, proposed using the top of the tower as a mooring mast for dirigibles in the 1920s and 1930s. However, this plan faced several challenges. Firstly, the risk of flammable hydrogen gas in non-American dirigibles posed a significant safety concern. Additionally, the unpredictable wind patterns at the top of the building could cause the airships to sway dangerously and potentially crash into surrounding structures or pedestrians. Furthermore, existing regulations prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making dirigible activity with the Empire State Building illegal. As a result, despite Smith's innovative idea, the practical challenges and safety risks ultimately prevented the use of the building as a mooring mast for dirigibles in New York City during that time.
334	15167	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top building. The stress and pressure of a thousand foot dirigible docked at the top of the building was too great for the buildings original framework to support, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so the pressure would be transmitted to the building's foundation. Another obstacle was most dirigibles from outside the US were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was much more flammable and the hydrogen dirigibles like the German dirigible Hindenburg were destroyed in fire, and they didn't want that to happen over New York's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast, the back would swivel around the mooring mast. The many unseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it an impractical docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s, after airplanes and dirigibles had disappeared, the ticketing and bagging rooms were turned into tourist and sightseers areas. Ultimately, the challenges faced in constructing the mooring mast exemplify the complexities and considerations involved in implementing innovative features in iconic structures like the Empire State Building."
335	15168	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many obstacles. One of these obstacles being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" Furthermore, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame, such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" Various obstacles plagued the construction of the docks, making it a challenging task for the builders to overcome."
336	15169	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The unforeseen safety issues lead to the downfall of the creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1). They saw some of the dangerous affect of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1). Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those of mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1). This made it hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). Not only was nature playing against the builders, but the law was also. This is almost negligence on the builders part to not realize that they would be breaking a law by constructing this mooring mast. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1). Although the idea for a dirigible mooring mast on top of the empire State building seemed innovative and practical, it was irrelevant due to the many obstacles that obstructed the builders of the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the challenges posed by safety concerns, unpredictable winds, and legal restrictions proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking concept at the Empire State Building."
337	15170	6	3	The dangers of using hydrogen in dirigibles were a significant concern for builders attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building. Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a serious risk in the event of a fire. Additionally, the location of the building in the heart of New York City added to the risks involved. If a blimp were to catch fire, it would not have the luxury of landing in a remote area, potentially causing chaos and destruction in a densely populated urban environment. Furthermore, the unpredictable winds at such heights made docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building a risky proposition. The combination of these factors made it clear that attempting to dock dirigibles at this location was not a wise decision.
338	15171	6	3	Al Smith's vision for the Empire State Building included not only making it the tallest building in the world but also incorporating a unique transportation feature. He proposed adding a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to dock there, enabling passengers to embark and disembark while the airships refueled or underwent servicing. However, the builders faced challenges in implementing this plan, primarily due to the lack of sufficient landing area on the building.   One of the major obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the issue of weather conditions. While dirigibles could easily moor in open landing fields, the windy and unpredictable weather in an urban setting could pose risks. The airships could potentially weigh down, causing them to dangle high above the streets where pedestrians walked. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the possibility of dirigibles docking at the building.  Despite these obstacles, Al Smith's determination and vision ultimately led to the construction of the Empire State Building, a marvel of engineering and architecture that remains an iconic landmark to this day.
339	15172	6	3	"Through life, many people plan to make or build amazing objects but often face significant challenges in achieving their goals. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, @ORGANIZATION1 sets out to construct the world's tallest building, the Empire State Building. However, in order to accomplish this incredible feat, they must overcome various obstacles, such as allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. The fierce and unpredictable winds at the top of the building pose a major challenge, as these violent air currents could make it unsafe for dirigibles to dock. Additionally, there is an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which further complicates the possibility of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building was ultimately completed and stood as the tallest building in the world on December 11, 1929. This story serves as a reminder that while challenges may arise, determination and perseverance can lead to the realization of even the most ambitious dreams."
340	15173	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 they described the greatest reason was one of the safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM2 they also describe another obstacle was the nature itself because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Even dirigles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, this could be dangerous for pedestrians. In paragraph @NUM3 they describe another reason why dirigles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are some examples of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles docking there. One can appreciate the challenges and complexities involved in attempting to make the Empire State Building a docking station for dirigibles, with safety concerns, unpredictable wind patterns, and legal restrictions all playing a significant role in hindering this ambitious plan.
341	15174	6	3	The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles severely affected the building's attempt at a dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time, most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flammable than Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible were to ignite, then a catastrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devastating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architects and engineers to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible off course, then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown off course while docking, then the pedestrians on the ground level could be injured. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock, as the building's peak was often shrouded in fog or low-hanging clouds, reducing visibility and making it difficult for pilots to navigate and land safely. Overall, the combination of flammable gases, strong winds, and challenging weather conditions made it impractical and unsafe for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
342	15175	6	3	"Dirigibles, or blimps, were seen as the transportation of the future. In order to add height and yet serve a purpose, architects of the Empire State Building decided to build a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" While the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, the usage of it as a docking station for dirigibles would never be fulfilled. The obstacles that builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, thus having violent shifts in air currents. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles also used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights to be weighed down; however, by using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights provided a safety hazard to civilians below. Builders had created the mooring mast to dock dirigibles, but the idea caused problems and was never fulfilled. Ultimately, the mooring mast, although a striking addition to the Empire State Building, remained unused for its intended purpose due to the various challenges and safety concerns that arose."
343	15176	6	3	There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. This stress would cause the buildings foundation to crack. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was done, they then had complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but could not be used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the ideas of dirigibles and mooring mast, for the dirigibles had dissapeared. Despite the challenges faced in attempting to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building, the architectural innovations and modifications undertaken serve as a testament to the ambitious vision of the time.
344	15177	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there was a futile effort. They tried numerous different ways to approach this idea, with architects designing a new glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that ranged from the bottom to the top of the Empire State Building to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were to be docked. However, the fate of the mast was not bright. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This statement holds true, highlighting that the architects' work was not fully planned and overlooked for the mast to be durable."
345	15178	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigible couldn't do anything even if tethered to the mooring mast, as the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. These challenges posed serious problems for the builders and designers of the Empire State Building, making it difficult to find a practical solution for dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper.
346	15179	6	3	The installation of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building would have made the building, as well as the city of New York, incredibly important to modern travel in the 1930s. Alas, many difficult obstacles made the mast impossible to complete. First, to get the mast to the top, the buildings frame had to be strengthened and reinforced, which was painstaking and expensive. Second, the builders had to deal with the possibility of the blimps exploding. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. With constantly shifting, violent winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin would sway and swivel around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers. With high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and fall onto the city below, potentially killing hundreds. Lastly, the builders failed to take into account the law that forbade dirigibles to fly too close to urban areas. This law made it illegal for any blimp to get near the Empire State Building, let alone dock on it. The thought of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit one destined to fail from the beginning. Despite the grand vision, the practical challenges and safety concerns surrounding the project ultimately led to its downfall.
347	15180	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is mainly about builders and architects attempting to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building in New York. At first, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring on passengers. The mooring mast was needed because ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (paragraph @NUM1). One reason why this plan did not work out was because it was not safe, because the hydrogen that dirigibles use is highly flamable (and this could cause a serious fire). Also, if it was a windy day, the dirigibles could get pushed around by the winds. To stop this, they have lead weights to weight them down, but they cannot use these with all of the people and other buildings around. Also, dirigibles could not fly too low over these kinds of areas. Although the plan did not work, it was better to have everyone be safe. Additionally, the structural integrity of the Empire State Building was a concern, as the weight and movement of the dirigibles could potentially compromise the building's stability. In the end, the risks outweighed the benefits, and the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was abandoned."
348	15181	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast, further obstacles arose after its completion. Safety concerns regarding the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in dirigibles, exemplified by the tragic Hindenburg disaster, added a layer of complexity. The ever-shifting winds at the top of the building also posed a danger, with violent air currents making it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock. Furthermore, legal restrictions preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach the vicinity. Despite these obstacles, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building persevered in their efforts to create a functional and visually appealing mooring mast atop this iconic structure.
349	15182	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2 it was revealed that docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges. Al Smith, the Architect, initially believed the mooring mast could be constructed without issue. However, it became apparent that the addition of the mooring mast would place excessive stress on the building's framework, necessitating costly modifications. The catastrophic fate of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst further underscored the dangers of having hydrogen-filled airships hovering above densely populated areas like New York City. Natural elements, such as violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty-foot altitude, made it clear that the construction of the mooring mast was unfeasible. The swiveling of the dirigible due to the inability to use weights for stabilization in an urban setting, as well as legal restrictions on flying airships too low over cities, ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles."
350	15183	6	3	The challenges faced by the builders while attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building were significant. The limited landing room in New York City posed a major obstacle, requiring extensive modifications to the building's steel frame. Over sixty thousand dollars were spent on strengthening and modifying the structure to reduce stress and ensure safe docking. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully overcame the challenges, ultimately achieving their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building.
351	15184	6	3	Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building on top of New York. He envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. Technical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. First, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure their landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be even more problematic in the city as if a Dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city. Neither of the Dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of New York City would have been, safety problems could not be fixed and there were too many people around to risk it. Ultimately, the challenges of docking dirigibles in an urban area, particularly in a city as densely populated as New York, proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of Al Smith's ambitious plan for the Empire State Building.
352	15185	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced were when they were planning to build a mask for the Dirigibles. When they first tried to build it, they figured out that the structure of the Empire State building could not hold the mask. The Empire State building had to support both the mask and the Dirigibles. Then at the end of the story, they figured out there was no way to do it. That was one of the obstacles.
353	15186	6	3	"Whenever architectural work is put in act, thoughts of the potential consequences should be thought out beforehand. In ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The blimps consist of dangerous chemicals and, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A possibility of flames could result in a ruined building, and even worse, a destroyed city. Although fires were a problem to consider, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This building is extremely high in the sky, therefore the winds get quite brutal. If a blimp was tied to the mast, the back of the ship continuously swivel and ruin the fabric of the aircraft. A mooring mast was just not a bright idea for a large city like New York. The population was too large, and the area was too crowded. The obstacles the architects faced were serious, and they helped the team to kill the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The potential risks of fire and damage to the dirigibles were simply too great to overcome, leading to the conclusion that the mooring mast was not a feasible option for the iconic building."
354	15187	6	3	"Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. These obstacles included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe between the explosive tendencies of Hydrogen and the unmanageable winds. With the winds the dirigible would continue to move around the mast creating an extremely unsafe environment for all. Availability would also be put into question, in paragraph fifteen @ORGANIZATION2 tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles @CAPS1 to dock due to the unavailable route of safe entrance. This unavailability made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible. The obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety. Additionally, the limited technology of the time made it challenging to ensure a secure docking process, further complicating the feasibility of the mooring mast project. Despite these challenges, the builders persisted in their efforts to create a groundbreaking structure that would leave a lasting legacy on the New York City skyline. Ultimately, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of adversity."
355	15188	6	3	There are many obstacles with the docking of the dirigibles, for example in the text it talked about if the accident had taken place over New York it would have been a lot worse because New York is a populated city. Another obstacle was the height as mentioned in the text, and anything could happen at that height so those are some obstacles in the way of the docking of the dirigibles. Additionally, the unpredictable weather conditions, such as strong winds or sudden storms, could pose a significant challenge for the docking process. These factors must be carefully considered and managed to ensure the safe and successful docking of the dirigibles. Overall, the docking of dirigibles presents various obstacles that require thorough planning and caution to overcome.
356	15189	6	3	"In the article, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest building. To make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Smith decided to create a ""mooring mast"" where dirigibles could land and become ""transportation of the future."" However, the dirigibles never landed, because there were many obstacles in landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Many Dirigibles that are from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and because the Empire State Building is in New York City, it would be hazardous for a hydrogen filled dirigible to land, in a densely populated area, like New York City. Another obstacle faced is the weather at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds are much stronger than down the streets. If the dirigible were able to land, the winds would be blowing the dirigible all around and out of control. Finally, it is illegal to have a airships flying too low to the ground and near people. By having a dirigible land on the mast, it would break the law. There were too many obstacles for Al Smith's idea to become reality. Additionally, the structural integrity of the Empire State Building itself would have been compromised by the weight and force of a landing dirigible, posing a significant risk to the building and its occupants. The impracticality and danger of the mooring mast concept ultimately led to its abandonment, solidifying the Empire State Building's place in history as an architectural masterpiece, rather than a hub for airship travel."
357	15190	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles. They would not be able to simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unsteady, requiring the frame to be strengthened to withstand the stress, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. However, in the end, the mooring mast was never constructed due to safety concerns, the unpredictable nature of the wind, and legal restrictions. The highly flammable nature of dirigibles posed a significant risk to the densely populated area, and the shifting winds made it difficult to control the airship. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to tie up to the building. Ultimately, the obstacles were insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
358	15191	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed.
359	15192	6	3	The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Additionally, the height of the building could also pose a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock, considering the difficulty of maneuvering such large airships in close proximity to a tall structure. The risks involved in attempting to navigate a dirigible to land on the mast of the Empire State Building outweighed any potential benefits, leading to the decision to prohibit such landings. Ultimately, safety concerns and practical limitations prevented dirigibles from docking on the iconic building, ensuring the protection of both the dirigible passengers and the people in the city below.
360	15193	6	3	"There are concerns about dirigibles docking, one of them being that ""The dirigibles would sway in the wind as the passengers walked down a gangplank."" This could potentially be dangerous as the swaying motion of the dirigible could cause passengers to lose their balance and fall off the gangplank. This risk of falling poses a significant safety hazard that needs to be addressed in order to ensure the safety of passengers boarding and disembarking from the dirigible."
361	15194	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to the challenging nature of the winds at the building's height. The violent air currents caused the dirigibles to sway and swivel around the mooring mast, making docking difficult and dangerous. Additionally, the decision to use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of the safer option of helium, added to the risks involved in mooring dirigibles at the building. These obstacles ultimately proved to be too difficult to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
362	15195	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included the lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles in New York City. However, Al Smith recognized this challenge as an opportunity and proposed the addition of a mooring mast at the top of the building. This mast would allow dirigibles to anchor for several hours, enabling refueling, service, and the boarding and disembarking of passengers. The docking process involved an electric winch that would haul in a line from the front of the ship and secure it to the mast. This innovative solution not only addressed the issue of limited landing space in the city but also showcased the Empire State Building as a pioneering structure in aviation history.
363	15196	6	3	"The main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building's Mooring Mast was safety. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" ""The owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above downtown New York."" If an accident were to happen with a dirigible it would be putting hundreds of people's lives at risk. That is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe. Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building's mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Lead weights could be used, but that was neither practical nor safe where they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Moreover, the unpredictable weather conditions, including sudden gusts of wind, would further complicate the docking process and pose a significant risk to both the dirigible and the people below. Therefore, the combination of safety concerns and the challenging natural environment made docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building's Mooring Mast an impractical and hazardous proposition."
364	15197	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock are highlighted. One challenge was the use of hydrogen by dirigibles from outside the United States, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk. Another major obstacle was the nature of the Empire State Building itself. Dirigibles moored in open fields could use lead weights for stability, but this method was not practical or safe when docking high above street level.  Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building were determined to find a solution that would enable dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper. The potential dangers posed by hydrogen and the unique structural challenges of the building required innovative thinking and careful planning. By overcoming these obstacles, the builders would not only enhance the functionality of the Empire State Building but also establish a new era of transportation and technology.
365	15198	6	3	The builders faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One major issue was the lack of available land area in New York for landing. Additionally, the flat roof of the building posed a challenge as it was not suitable for direct landing. The presence of cables at the top of the building added stress to the structure, requiring costly reinforcement work. Safety concerns also arose, such as the risk of heavy weights dangling above pedestrians on the street and the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in dirigibles. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited the flying of airships above urban areas, further complicating the builders' efforts. Overall, these obstacles made it difficult for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, highlighting the numerous challenges faced by the builders in this endeavor.
366	15199	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous challenges with the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock there, particularly regarding the safety of the public. The potential use of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, posed a significant risk in case of a fire, similar to the tragic accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Additionally, the unpredictable winds on top of the building could cause dangerous maneuvers for dirigibles while docking, further endangering pedestrians in the vicinity. Ultimately, the mooring mast concept proved too perilous for the citizens of New York City and was deemed too risky to pursue.
367	15200	6	3	In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles. The first obstacle they encountered was the lack of a suitable landing area. Without a proper area for landing, there was no reason or way to construct the dock. Additionally, once the building was framed to the 85th floor, builders could not proceed with building the mast until the roof was completed, further delaying the project.   The biggest challenge the mast faced was the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building. The constantly shifting winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely land or remain in place without the risk of crashing. Another obstacle that hindered the project was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach or tie up at the building.  Overall, despite being a great idea in theory, the obstacles faced during the construction of the dirigible dock made it impractical and ultimately a waste of time and resources.
368	15201	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were primarily due to the windy conditions and the flammability of the dirigibles. The strong winds made it difficult for the dirigibles to hook up to the docking gear, posing a significant challenge for safe and stable docking. Additionally, the highly flammable nature of the dirigibles posed a serious risk to the city in the event of a fire. Furthermore, it was illegal for any ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, further complicating the feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
369	15202	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building. These challenges made it difficult to implement the use of dirigibles at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complexities involved in creating a docking system for airships in a bustling urban environment.
370	15203	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, they risked having dirigibles from outside the U.S. cause a fire, as most of them used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. This posed a significant safety concern, especially in densely populated areas like downtown New York. Additionally, the builders had to contend with the challenge of unpredictable wind patterns on top of the building. The violent air currents made it difficult to secure the dirigibles, even with measures such as lead weights, which could pose hazards to pedestrians below. Furthermore, a law prohibiting airships from flying too low presented a legal obstacle to the construction of the docking station. This restriction made it impossible for a ship to land on the building or even approach the area, effectively thwarting the builders' plans. In conclusion, the various challenges outlined in the excerpt highlight the complexity and risks involved in the ambitious project of building a dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
371	15204	6	3	The obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the Empire State Building was, they couldn't put the fuel on top of the building. Putting a mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and put a lot of pressure on it. For this to happen, they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over $1 million. After successfully building that, they had another obstacle. It was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents. They never figured out how and the idea just disappeared.
372	15205	6	3	Another challenge faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in constructing the mooring mast was the weather conditions in New York City. Strong winds, common in the area, could pose a danger to dirigibles attempting to dock at the mast. The unpredictable weather patterns in the city made it difficult to ensure the safety of airships approaching the building. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building itself presented an obstacle for dirigibles trying to navigate their way to the mooring mast. The towering structure could potentially disrupt the flight path of airships, making it hazardous for them to attempt to dock. These various challenges, from structural concerns to safety issues and weather conditions, made the construction of the mooring mast a complex and risky endeavor for the builders of the Empire State Building.
373	15206	6	3	One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city. Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles. Additionally, the lack of suitable landing areas and infrastructure for dirigibles further hindered their operations. The limited availability of trained personnel and resources for dirigible maintenance and operation also posed a challenge for the team. These combined obstacles made it increasingly difficult for the dirigible project to succeed in the city.
374	15207	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were significant. Strong wind currents, the flammability of dirigibles, and their large size made it challenging to create a docking system. The decision to use hydrogen instead of helium should have halted the project, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Nature itself posed the biggest obstacle, with unpredictable weather conditions making it difficult to safely dock dirigibles. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to create a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
375	15208	6	3	Another obstacle faced by builders was the lack of space on the narrow rooftop of the Empire State Building. The limited area made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible into position for docking. Additionally, the height of the building posed a challenge as dirigibles would have to navigate through strong winds and turbulent air currents to reach the top safely. Despite these challenges, the workers persevered in their efforts to make dirigible docking a reality at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the obstacles proved too great, and the idea was never fully realized.
376	15209	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were significant. The shifting winds at the top of the building created by violent air currents made it challenging for dirigibles to remain stable around the mooring mast. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles from outside the United States posed a major safety risk due to its flammability. The tragic incident of the Hindenburg disaster highlighted the potential catastrophic consequences of a similar event occurring over downtown New York. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, presenting a legal barrier to the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast. These obstacles ultimately led to the mooring mast being utilized solely for display purposes, despite its initial intention to accommodate dirigibles.
377	15210	6	3	In the excerpt, the @CAPS1 were faced with multiple issues regarding their theory of using airships. They realized that airships were restricted from flying too low over urban areas due to safety regulations. Additionally, they discovered that wind could cause the airships to swing around when docked, posing a risk to those below. Initially considering weighing down the rear of the ship, they soon understood the potential danger this posed to people on the ground. Hearing of airship disasters in New Jersey and New York due to hydrogen, they recognized the safety concerns associated with their plan. Overall, they began to grasp the impracticality and safety hazards of their original idea.
378	15211	6	3	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building was unrealistic because there was a lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan. As a new form of transportation, dirigbles were not safe. This was proven true when the German dirigble, ""Hindenburg"", exploded in 1937. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flamable dirigibles above population is unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to way down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique. The Empire State building builders and encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their because the concept was far past the capabilities of their age. The lack of foresight in the potential dangers and impracticalities of implementing dirigibles to dock on top of a skyscraper highlights the flawed nature of this idea, ultimately rendering it unfeasible and unsafe."
379	15212	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Additionally, the height of the building and the surrounding skyscrapers could create turbulence that would make it dangerous for dirigibles to navigate in close proximity. The structural integrity of the building would also be compromised if dirigibles were allowed to dock, potentially leading to safety concerns for both the passengers and the building itself. Ultimately, the challenges posed by dirigibles would have made it impractical to incorporate docking facilities for them on the Empire State Building.
380	15213	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Approximately $1 million worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. However, the mooring mast failed due to several reasons. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Additionally, weather conditions, such as violent air currents, proved to be a significant obstacle to the successful use of the mast. Ultimately, despite the elaborate design and modifications made, the dirigible docking project at the Empire State Building was not successful.
381	15214	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is that the architects made the Empire State Building more dirigibles. The architects put the thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building that is held by the cable tether. The dirigible's have to go through the wind pressure which was about eleven hundred feet below. The frame of the Empire State Building have to be strong and it cost more than sixty thousand dollars of modification to made the building's framework. The architects changed the design and made something new. The architects have a difficult obstacles of building the Empire State Building is to make it dirigibles. One of the main challenges they encountered was ensuring the strength of the building's frame to support the added weight and pressure of the dirigibles. This required extensive modifications and significant costs to achieve the desired design. Despite the obstacles faced, the architects were able to overcome these challenges and successfully create a unique and iconic structure in the form of the Empire State Building.
382	15215	6	3	During the construction of the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, architects and builders were faced with numerous obstacles. The stress of the dirigible's load posed a significant challenge as it would be transmitted to the building's foundation, necessitating changes in the framework to support the weight. Safety concerns were paramount, with the risk of a dirigible catching fire due to its flammable gas. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent winds at the building's pinnacle presented a danger, making it difficult to secure a dirigible in place. Despite attempts to overcome these challenges, legal issues further complicated the situation, as there were laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. The failed attempts to dock dirigibles ultimately led to the realization that the Empire State Building was not suitable for serving as a dirigible landing.
383	15216	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example, the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top of it. Additionally, the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable, so an accident above a densely populated urban area would have been costly and potentially fatal. Moreover, the wind posed a significant challenge as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would have caused the dirigible to be swiveling around and unstable, making the idea of docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building unpractical and unsafe. Ultimately, these obstacles made it clear that the risks associated with dirigibles outweighed any potential benefits, leading to the abandonment of the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
384	15217	6	3	The dirigibles faced some problems when they tried to dock them. The first reason would be that flying an airship that low over a urban area is against the law. Even though it is against the law they tried it anyways and faced more problems, such as, the winds. The one time that they tried they couldn't dock it because the winds are too strong. As a result, attempting to dock the airship in urban areas where it is prohibited and facing challenges like strong winds made the docking process difficult and unsuccessful.
385	15218	6	3	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building roof because it would be unable to support it. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether, it would only add stress to the frame. To fix this problem, the Empire State Building steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible. This modification was crucial to ensure the safety and stability of the structure when accommodating dirigibles, providing a solution that would meet the architectural and structural requirements of the iconic building.
386	15219	6	3	Based on the safety concerns surrounding the docking of dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, it was evident that the use of hydrogen-filled airships posed a significant risk. The tragic incident involving the Hindenburg in New Jersey highlighted the potential dangers associated with these vessels, especially in densely populated areas like New York City. The unpredictable winds at the top of the building further compounded the safety issues, making it impractical for dirigibles to dock there. Additionally, existing laws prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban areas reinforced the decision to prevent these vessels from flying in New York City. Overall, the decision to prohibit dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building was a necessary measure to ensure public safety and prevent any potential disasters.
387	15220	6	3	In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author discusses the challenges faced by builders trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One major obstacle was the difficulty of dropping the mast onto the building's flat roof without causing structural stress. Additionally, the strong winds in the area would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast, making docking dangerous. Safety was another significant concern, as dirigibles using flammable helium could pose a risk of explosion, endangering lives in New York City. Moreover, existing laws in New York prohibited balloons from docking due to the potential danger posed by airships flying too close to urban areas. These obstacles created significant hurdles in the efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as highlighted in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted.
388	15221	6	3	The idea of dirigibles being able to dock at such an altitude to begin with was foolish. First off trying to tie a thousand-foot dirigible to a building by a single tether adds huge stress to the building's frame. They were able to fix that problem, but the main issue they couldn't fix was mother nature. The wind speed at that height is incredibly violent and would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Overall the project was just doomed to fail from the start. The structural integrity of the building was compromised, and the unpredictable nature of the wind at such heights made it impossible for the dirigibles to safely dock. The combination of these factors ultimately led to the failure of the project.
389	15222	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, made it challenging for dirigibles to get close enough to the mooring mast and stay in place once tied up. Additionally, a pre-existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to approach the building. Furthermore, the use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles posed a significant safety risk to passengers, employees, and the densely populated area below. These obstacles combined to create significant challenges that ultimately prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
390	15223	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes the various obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the challenges was the need for a practical and safe mooring system, as noted by former New York governor Al Smith. The government engineers in Washington were also working on ensuring the safety of mooring airships to the mast atop the building. Additionally, the builders had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to support the weight and strain of a thousand-foot dirigible tethered by a single cable. This modification alone cost over sixty thousand dollars, adding to the complexity of the project. Despite these engineering challenges, the builders also had to contend with the unpredictable forces of nature, further complicating the task of creating a safe and functional mooring mast for dirigibles. These obstacles highlight the immense effort and planning required to incorporate such a feature into the iconic Empire State Building.
391	15224	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include poor designing, nature, and lack of landing area. Due to the poor designing of Al Smith, the Age of Dirigibles faced a challenge in finding suitable landing spots. Nature also posed a significant obstacle, with the winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This made it difficult for dirigibles to safely land. Additionally, the lack of landing area for the enormous balloons further complicated the situation. However, when Al Smith identified the opportunity to use the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles, he seized it, despite the hurdles that had to be overcome."
392	15225	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building would present architects with significant challenges. The additional weight and wind pressure from a thousand-foot dirigible would place immense stress on the building's frame, requiring modifications to ensure the load could be safely supported. However, safety concerns, particularly regarding the use of hydrogen in dirigibles and the risk of fires, have hindered the implementation of this idea. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of winds on top of the building could cause the dirigible to sway uncontrollably, posing a threat to both the structure and surrounding areas. These obstacles highlight the complex and unrealized challenges that would need to be overcome for the successful integration of dirigibles with the Empire State Building.
393	15226	6	3	"Builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle in docking dirigibles was the framework of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This shows the amount of work that needed to be done just on the structure of the building. Another hardship was that most dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with highly flamable hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" This highlights how dangerous the hydrogen could be. Lastly, dirigibles could be weighed down by led weights. ""Using these at the Empire State Building, would be dangling over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" If the lead weights dropped they could kill someone. Many hardships were brought about trying to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building. The challenges faced in modifying the building's structure, the dangers of using hydrogen-filled dirigibles, and the risks posed by lead weights all contributed to the difficulties in docking dirigibles at the iconic skyscraper."
394	15227	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced various challenges when adding the mast to the structure. They had to consult with experts and study dirigibles to understand how to effectively incorporate the mast. Merely attaching the mast was not sufficient; reinforcing the entire steel frame was necessary to withstand the additional stress. Designing an aesthetically pleasing mast also required significant resources. However, despite meticulous planning, the project was unsuccessful due to uncontrollable natural elements. Strong air currents around the mast posed a significant risk, potentially causing a crash that could harm many in the bustling city below. As a result, the project had to be abandoned, with the mast serving solely as a decorative feature on the iconic building.
395	15228	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively."
396	15229	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the empire state building then having a giant dirigible moor on to it would cause stress on the building and could pull the mast right off causing it to weigh the dirigible down to the people and buildings it could cause death and destruction. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They dont want the mast to be done when the whole building is only on floor 1 out of 102. Timing was crucial to ensure the structural integrity of the building and the safety of the dirigibles docking there. Balancing these factors was essential in overcoming the challenges of incorporating a dirigible docking system into the Empire State building.
397	15230	6	3	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well thought out.  Furthermore, the logistics of landing and taking off from such a tall building were complex and risky. The limited space available for maneuvering and the proximity to other buildings and structures posed significant challenges for dirigible pilots. Additionally, the noise and disruption caused by the arrival and departure of dirigibles in a busy urban area would have been a major inconvenience for residents and businesses.  In conclusion, while the idea of using the Empire State Building as an airdock for dirigibles was ambitious, the practicality and feasibility of such a venture were ultimately too problematic to overcome. The project faced numerous technical, safety, and logistical issues that made it unviable for successful implementation. Despite the creativity and vision behind the concept, it was clear that the risks and challenges associated with using the iconic building in such a manner were simply too great to overcome.
398	15231	6	3	One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City due to the abundance of buildings and limited flat ground. Additionally, they encountered difficulty in getting the mooring mast on top of the building, requiring a stronger building frame to support it without causing structural stress. Another challenge was the unpredictable and strong winds at the building's height, causing the dirigible to sway even when tethered. Lastly, a law prohibited dirigibles from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, preventing them from docking at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, these obstacles combined to prevent dirigibles from utilizing the building as a docking station.
399	15232	6	3	In addition, the builders had to consider the impact of the mast on the overall stability of the Empire State Building. The added weight and height of the mast could potentially affect the balance and structural integrity of the entire building, posing a significant challenge that needed to be carefully addressed. Moreover, the safety of those on board the dirigible and in the building itself had to be taken into account, requiring thorough planning and implementation of safety measures. Overall, the construction of the mooring mast presented a complex engineering feat that demanded meticulous attention to detail and innovative solutions to ensure the successful integration of the dirigible docking system with the iconic Empire State Building.
400	15233	6	3	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the building of the Empire State Building had many obstacles the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark was the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and greatest obstacle of all was nature surrounding the Empire State Building. The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is the dirigibles couldn't even try to attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, one dirigible approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough fearing the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even installed which meant the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigible, which could get tiring. The greatest obstacle of all was nature. Winds at the top of the building were really strong due to the violent wind currents, which could cause the dirigible to keep moving, even when tied up to the mast. Overall, the nature of weather was the huge obstacle. Another challenge faced by the builders was the extreme height of the building, making it difficult for airships to approach and dock safely. Additionally, the lack of proper communication systems between the dirigible and the ground crew added to the complexities of the mooring process. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building's mooring mast remains a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of adversity.
401	15234	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock, as strong winds at such altitudes could make it difficult for airships to maintain stability. Moreover, the limited space at the top of the building made it hard for dirigibles to maneuver and dock without the risk of collisions or accidents. Despite the ambitious plans, these obstacles ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a docking station for dirigibles."
402	15235	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated New York City. Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe. In addition to the safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building.
403	15236	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast. One problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there. This was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible. The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure. Another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. Eventually, these obstacles and other safety issues, such as hydrogen inside, the blimp being highly flammable, caused the idea to disappear. Despite the initial vision for a dirigible mast on the Empire State Building, safety concerns and legal restrictions ultimately led to the abandonment of the concept.
404	15237	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to try to dock dirigibles there. One of the challenges they faced was how to make sure the building wouldn't collapse if they docked a 100-foot dirigible on the top. They had to make about 2 million dollars worth of changes to the building's frame to be able to accommodate a dirigible. Another obstacle they faced was how to dock a dirigible at the top of the building without endangering the densely populated area of downtown New York. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders faced many obstacles by trying to dock a dirigible at the top of the building, but it was impossible from the start due to the risks involved in using hydrogen gas."
405	15238	6	3	Obstacles the builders faced included the additional pressure on the frame of the spacecraft and the challenging docking process. Furthermore, high-speed winds added to the difficulty of the mission, making it almost impossible to carry out. These hurdles required innovative solutions and careful planning to ensure the successful completion of the project.
406	15239	6	3	Based on The Mooring Mast article, by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building face numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their dream put New York on the forefront of modern travel never was fulfilled. First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework because of the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in highly populated areas such as New York. Also, the violent winds on top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and not swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be unsafe dangling from a building. Finally, the idea violated a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of the contributing obstacles the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles unsuccessful. Despite their efforts and modifications, safety concerns, and legal restrictions proved insurmountable, ultimately thwarting their vision of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
407	15240	6	3	Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the Empire State Building's mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. One problem was figuring out how to reinforce the mast so that the load could transfer to the foundation instead of ripping off the top half of the building. It was essential to ensure that the mast was not only strong enough to support the weight of a blimp but also resistant to the forces exerted by wind and other environmental factors. Engineers had to carefully design and implement a system of supports and reinforcements to ensure the stability and safety of the mooring mast. Through meticulous planning and innovative engineering solutions, the builders were able to overcome these challenges and successfully complete the construction of the Empire State Building's iconic mooring mast.
408	15241	6	3	The concept of a docking mast for the Empire State Building faced failure due to various reasons. One major issue was its location directly over the densely populated downtown area of New York City, as highlighted by the Hindenburg fire incident in New Jersey. The potential danger of accidents occurring over such a populated area was a significant concern for the building owners. Additionally, controlling a dirigible in the turbulent winds at the tower's pinnacle posed a considerable challenge, especially since using lead weights for stabilization over a civilian area was deemed impractical and unsafe. Moreover, existing laws prohibiting low-flying aircraft over cities presented a legal obstacle to the implementation of the docking mast. Despite attempts by two dirigibles to approach the mooring mast, neither successfully allowed passengers to disembark, leading to the quiet abandonment of the idea. Ultimately, the numerous obstacles faced by the builders made the docking mast concept unfeasible and unsustainable, resulting in its eventual discontinuation.
409	15242	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (L¸sted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (L¸sted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach. Ultimately, the challenges of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles proved insurmountable, with safety concerns, wind conditions, and legal restrictions preventing successful implementation of the concept."
410	15243	6	3	The architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself. One of the problems was that most dirigibles outside of the country use hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make the blimps buoyant. If one of those blimps ever caught fire like the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, then it would put many citizens in jeopardy. This densely populated area would be much more hazardous than a rural area in New Jersey. The last problem they faced was the law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Therefore, no foreign dirigible could dock and refuel there because of the type of gas keeping it afloat. Furthermore, no domestic dirigible could dock and refuel due to the law prohibiting it. As a result, the idea of a mooring mast quickly diminished from the citizens' imaginations, and they looked to modern transportation such as airplanes.
411	15244	6	3	"Besides the facts that docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would cost over $1 million and add a lot of stress to the building's frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream. Unfortunately, he couldn't do that. There are three big reasons. In paragraph three it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in fire in New Jersey. Paragraph three says docking the dirigibles is plain dangerous because the wind would cause them to sway all over, rather than being docked on the ground and being weighed down. Lastly, it wasn't legal. Paragraph four states ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was another practical reason."" The dirigibles would not be high enough in the air to be legal, and it was highly dangerous because of pedestrians below. Ultimately, Smith's dream of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not feasible due to safety concerns, cost implications, and legal restrictions."
412	15245	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, particularly the unpredictable and violent air currents caused by the wind. This made it challenging for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building, as the shifting winds posed a significant risk to both the airship and the building.
413	15246	6	3	In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a mooring mast was necessary. One could not simply Place one on the empire state building because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized a disaster it would cause if it hapened in New York. Nature was also an obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as it could be in a field. It was a risk not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such elevation over urban areas. These were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Despite the challenges, it was clear that safety concerns and regulatory restrictions ultimately led to the abandonment of the ambitious mooring mast project, ensuring the Empire State Building remained a towering symbol of architectural achievement without the added risk of dirigible docking.
414	15247	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof, which meant that significant modifications and strengthening of the building were necessary for a thousand-foot dirigible to land. Safety was also a concern, as dirigibles from other countries used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. If a dirigible caught fire, downtown New York could have been destroyed by a large fire. Additionally, the architects had to contend with the constantly shifting winds on top of the building, which could cause the dirigible to swivel dangerously. These challenges presented significant obstacles for the architects, requiring careful planning and innovative solutions to ensure the safety and feasibility of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
415	15248	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirt dribbles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle faced with the fact that there was a law about airships flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, the use of lead weights could potentially pose a risk to the surrounding environment if they were to fall off the building. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building had to carefully consider all these obstacles before attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast.
416	15249	6	3	When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and foundation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the builders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work. Ultimately, the idea of dirigibles docking at the top of the @ORGANIZATION2 was deemed impractical and unsafe, leading the builders to abandon the project and focus on other aspects of the iconic structure.
417	15250	6	3	"While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al @CAPS1 idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.What's being built all the problems became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey... ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships too low over urban areas. The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. Despite their determination, the potential risks and legal restrictions ultimately made the idea unfeasible."
418	15251	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. If this happened then they never would have been able to land. The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger. It was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. It was just too dangerous to attempt.
419	15252	6	3	"Many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were issues that should have been thought about before construction began. At such a height, there were whirlwind issues that could push the dirigible in undesired directions. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" After the Hindenburg exploded, the concerns for the same thing happening were a large safety concern. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The volatile nature of the winds at such heights posed a significant risk, especially in densely populated areas. The potential for disaster was a major factor in the decision to ultimately abandon the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building."
420	15253	6	3	"There were several obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. First, if a dirigible was ""moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The framework was not strong enough for this. But the main reason was safety. It was known that most foreign dirigibles used ""hydrogen rather than helium"", which is highly flammable. Things wouldn't go well if there was an incident in a populated place like New York. Also, the winds causing the ship to swivel around, and lead couldn't be used to weigh it down for safety reasons. Finally, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which makes it illegal for any dirigible to even come close to a building. All of these reasons contributed to why docking dirigibles would come with many obstacles. Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigibles would make it difficult to navigate through the narrow spaces between buildings in the city. The logistics of maneuvering such a large aircraft in a densely populated area would pose a significant challenge, further complicating the docking process. In conclusion, the combination of structural limitations, safety concerns, legal restrictions, and logistical challenges made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
421	15254	6	3	Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The Hindenburg disaster served as a stark reminder of the dangers associated with using hydrogen as a lifting gas in airships. The tragic event prompted a shift towards the use of non-flammable helium in future airship designs, improving safety standards in the aviation industry.
422	15255	6	3	Another challenge faced by the builders was the need to ensure the safety of the dirigibles during landing and takeoff. The Mooring Mast needed to be able to withstand the powerful forces exerted by the airships, which could be significant due to their size and weight. Additionally, the builders had to consider the impact of the changing weather conditions on the structure, as storms and strong winds could pose a threat to the safety of the dirigibles. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to create a safe and secure landing platform for the airships, ultimately achieving success in their endeavor.
423	15256	6	3	"After reading the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it is clear that the project of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faces numerous obstacles. The builders have a significant amount of work ahead of them, including modifying and strengthening the building's frame to accommodate the added stress of a docking dirigible. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications are required to ensure the building's frame can support this new addition. Additionally, a mast must be constructed for the dirigibles to dock safely. The architects have envisioned a design that incorporates a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower, illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design mirroring the overall shape of the building. This mast construction adds to the already considerable workload of the builders. In conclusion, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in implementing a mooring mast for dirigibles are substantial and will require careful planning and execution to overcome."
424	15257	6	3	"Many things went wrong while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. First, allowing this dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building ""would add stress to the buildings frame"". These Dirigibles are highly flamable and over a very populated place like New York City could be very dangerous. The winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" If lead weights were used they could fall from dirigible and kill civilians. The biggest obstacle was that a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This seemed to be a good idea on paper but when actually attempted it was too unrealistic. Additionally, the logistics of maneuvering a dirigible in the congested airspace of New York City would have been a nightmare. Ultimately, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building was fraught with too many challenges and risks to be feasible."
425	15258	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. To solve this problem, Al Smith built a mooring mast. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours to refuel. The mooring mast was a crucial addition to the Empire State building, as it opened up the possibility of using dirigibles for transportation and cargo delivery in the bustling city. Despite the challenges faced, the innovative solution of the mooring mast paved the way for a new era of air travel and connectivity in New York City.
426	15259	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there, such as how to attach the mast and transport people between the dirigible and the building. To avoid adding stress to the building's frame, they had to strengthen and alter the steel frame to support the mast's weight and wind pressure. Additionally, they constructed a gangplank from an observation platform to move passengers and luggage between the dirigible and the building. However, the impracticality and danger of docking dirigibles 102 stories above New York City should have been a more significant consideration for the builders.
427	15260	6	3	There are many problems the dirigibles had with docking.  The one problem there was is a lack of suitable landing space.  There was also the problem of winds.  The wind would cause a major problem for if they could dock.  The wind could cause it to spin around the building causing injuries to people or the dirigible.If it's swong around an hit the building it could cause structural damage.  The dirigible could also explode into flames if a spark is caused from it hitn the building.  It could end up like the hindenburge. Additionally, another issue that dirigibles faced when docking was the challenge of maneuvering such a large and bulky aircraft in tight spaces. This made it difficult for the pilots to navigate and land safely, increasing the risk of accidents. Moreover, the lack of proper docking infrastructure and support systems also posed a significant obstacle. Without adequate facilities and equipment in place, it was hard to ensure a smooth and secure docking process for the dirigibles. These challenges made docking a precarious and challenging task for dirigibles, highlighting the various limitations and risks associated with this mode of transportation.
428	15261	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe. Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there. The challenges of modifying the building's structure and designing a docking system for the dirigibles proved to be complex tasks that required innovative solutions. Despite the difficulties faced, the builders persevered in their efforts to accommodate the airships, showcasing their determination and ingenuity in overcoming obstacles."
429	15262	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The risks involved in constructing a mast for the airships were too great, including the dangers of flying too low, potential fire or lightning strikes, and the risk of the mast breaking. As a result, the decision was made to postpone the final installation of the landing gear due to the unresolved issues with mooring airships to the mast. The safety concerns associated with the docking of airships at such a height made it necessary to reconsider the feasibility of this project at a later date.
430	15263	6	3	Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldnt just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the dirigibles load and the wind would add stress. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways.
431	15264	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, the project faced unrealistic expectations due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This legal hurdle posed a major challenge as it prevented dirigibles from safely approaching the building. Additionally, violent air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to get close enough to the building to dock, further complicating the process. Moreover, the use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, in most dirigibles posed a significant safety hazard in a densely populated area like New York City. The potential for a disastrous accident made the owners of the Empire State Building realize the dangers involved in attempting to accommodate dirigibles. As a result, dirigibles never lived up to their envisioned role as the transportation of the future and never docked on the Empire State Building."
432	15265	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest reason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people. The builders had to overcome significant challenges, including modifying the building's frame, addressing safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled dirigibles, and allocating a substantial amount of money for the necessary modifications. Despite these obstacles, they were determined to make the Empire State Building a groundbreaking structure in every aspect, including the potential for dirigibles to dock there."
433	15266	6	3	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obstacles. One obstacle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanning over 800 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obstacle they had to overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to residential areas. Although these reasons are significant, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. 22-paragraph 3). All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building, reaching over 1,400 feet, posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely land and take off. The strong winds at such heights made it even more dangerous for airships to navigate around the building. Despite the initial vision of using dirigibles as a mode of transportation to and from the iconic skyscraper, practical limitations and safety concerns ultimately led to the abandonment of this idea. Nature's unpredictable forces, combined with logistical and regulatory barriers, made it clear that dirigibles were not a feasible option for transportation to the Empire State Building."
434	15267	6	3	The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered various problems from the beginning to the end. The original design of the building did not account for a dirigible docking station, requiring additional structural modifications at a cost of $1 million. The safety risk posed by hydrogen-filled dirigibles, especially after the Hindenburg disaster, was a significant concern. The potential damage from a fire at such a height was alarming. Wind was another obstacle, as the force could strain the building's structure, and the lack of anchoring points added to the risk. The presence of tall spires in the skyline also posed a threat to dirigibles attempting to dock. Additionally, regulations prohibiting low-flying aircraft in urban areas posed a legal barrier to the implementation of the dirigible docking station. These challenges highlighted the impracticality and risks associated with the proposal, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the plan.
435	15268	6	3	The problems that the Building had to face regarding the mooring of airships to fixed masts at such a height made it necessary to delay the installation of the landing gear. This decision was made due to the challenges posed by the unique design and height of the building, which made it difficult to safely secure airships without proper landing gear. As a result, the installation of the landing gear was deemed impractical at the current time and was scheduled for a later date when a more suitable solution could be implemented. By postponing this aspect of the project, the Building aimed to ensure the safety and efficiency of any future airship mooring operations.
436	15269	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced attempting to make the dock for dirigibles were significant. The architects had designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that needed to be strong enough to withstand the wind at the top. Additionally, they would have to navigate the legal challenges that came with constructing a dirigible dock. These obstacles required careful planning and innovative solutions to ensure the successful completion of the project.
437	15270	6	3	Another obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their plans for dirigibles was the issue of using hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen, commonly used in dirigibles outside the United States, posed a significant safety risk due to its flammability. This difference in gas used added another layer of complexity to the challenge of implementing dirigible mooring on the building. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered and found alternative solutions to achieve their vision of a dirigible-friendly structure.
438	15271	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles. Nature itself. Even if the dirigible was tethered up to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly over too low over urban areas. Although two dirigibles attempted but failed, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. However, despite the challenges faced, the Empire State Building remains an iconic symbol of New York City, standing as a testament to human ingenuity and determination in the face of adversity.
439	15272	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame, which required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix. Additionally, the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, a dangerous situation that needed to be addressed. Attaching a lead weight to the back of the dirigible in urban areas posed risks due to low-flying laws and potential accidents. Despite their efforts, dirigibles never became a popular mode of transportation, adding to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in creating a dirigible docking station.
440	15273	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof, as it would add stress to the building's frame. Additionally, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, posing a significant safety risk. Furthermore, violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast, making tethering difficult and dangerous. Ultimately, these obstacles led to the realization that the mooring mast would never fulfill its intended purpose, highlighting the impracticality and safety concerns associated with the project.
441	15274	6	3	"By attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles that they faced was the re-designing of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" that meant that they had to make modifications (over $1 million worth). Another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. And the greatest obstacle that the builders had was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Even if the Dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasn't safe. Furthermore, the unpredictable weather conditions, such as sudden storms or heavy rain, posed additional risks to the safe docking of dirigibles on the skyscraper. Despite the ambitious vision of utilizing the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station, the challenges presented by structural, safety, and environmental factors ultimately proved too formidable to overcome."
442	15275	6	3	The architects faced numerous challenges when attempting to modify the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. They had to redesign the building's framework to accommodate the added weight and stress of the airships. Additionally, they had to construct two new floors at the peak of the building to serve as the boarding area for passengers. After completing these modifications, they proudly raised the American flag at the top of the mooring mast. However, it soon became evident that the designs were not only unsafe but also impractical. Despite their efforts to overcome obstacles, the architects ultimately realized that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a feasible endeavor.
443	15276	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg, it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building. Ultimately, these challenges highlighted the impracticality and potential dangers of attempting to use the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles."
444	15277	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a serious problem if the dirigible burst into flames and fire rained down on, ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle to the creation of the mooring mast was the wind, which, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles would have to be, ""weighted down with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" This would be, ""neither practical nor safe."" because the weights could fall and kill people. The final obstacle for building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the mooring mast faced many problems, ""that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These challenges highlight the complexities involved in constructing a safe and functional mooring mast for dirigibles in a bustling city like New York."
445	15278	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame. Another is having all the flammable gases above a highly populated area. Also there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly, the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship too unstable. Considering these challenges, it became apparent that enabling dirigibles to dock on the building was not a feasible option.
446	15279	6	3	The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts to overcome obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station, gathering crucial information for their project. Additionally, they met with the president of a newly formed airship transport company that had plans to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. By seeking advice from these experts and industry professionals, the builders of the Empire State Building were able to address the challenges they faced in implementing the mooring mast for dirigibles.
447	15280	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced a challenging task in modifying the structure to allow dirigibles to dock. With over sixty thousand dollars spent on modifications, it was clear that a significant investment was required. The complexity of the job was evident in the fact that simply adding a mooring mast to the flat roof was not a viable solution. Safety issues were a primary concern throughout the process, underscoring the meticulous planning and execution necessary for the project. Despite the obstacles faced, the architects persevered, ultimately achieving their goal of creating a docking point for dirigibles atop the iconic Empire State Building.
448	15281	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building the workers faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was safety. While the dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked its body would sway in the breeze. This lead to a question of safety for the passengers getting on and off. Also there was no safe way to weigh the dirigible down, like when the dirigible lands in a field. Any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians. Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area. The main obstacle was nature itself. There are very violent winds at the top of the Empire State Building which would cause the dirigible to sway. Docking at the Empire State Building was too complicated for the idea to be completed. In conclusion, the challenges of safety concerns, legal restrictions, and natural elements proved to be insurmountable barriers for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
449	15282	6	3	In some cases, builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety. One of the main reasons for this was the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles outside the city, which posed a significant risk if a fire were to break out on top of the building. Additionally, there were laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which posed a danger to the densely populated downtown location of the Empire State Building. Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of the violent air currents on top of the building increased the risk of dirigibles colliding with the structure or each other. Lastly, the lack of complete dirigible mooring equipment meant that even if safety and legal concerns were addressed, there would still be no way for dirigibles to safely land on the building. These obstacles highlight the importance of thorough planning and consideration of potential risks in construction projects of this scale.
450	15283	6	3	The obsticles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where the weather, and the Building Frame. The @CAPS1 obsticle was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violant air currents. The wind was an obsticle because of a big gust of wind came it could not building materials or even workers off the building. A second obsticle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady. These are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the empire state building @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges faced by the builders highlight the complexity of integrating dirigible docking facilities into a tall structure like the Empire State Building, underscoring the importance of meticulous planning and engineering precision in such endeavors.
451	15284	6	3	The mooring mast was a failure from the start. The builders and architects were not looking at the problems that would be present but only at how to build the most. The first main problem the building workers faced when attempting to allow these dirigibles to land was actually building a mast atop the highest building in the world. Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the building's framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground. Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety. The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out. For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay aloft, and if a hydrogen-filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty imminent people below would be harmed. This project seems to present far too many obstacles for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp. Moreover, the potential risks involved in having such massive airships docking in densely populated areas would have far-reaching consequences and could lead to disastrous outcomes. Therefore, the idea of a mooring mast for zepplins in urban areas was not only impractical but also highly risky, making its failure inevitable from the start.
452	15285	6	3	The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was in competition with the Chrysler Building to be the tallest building, and Governor Al Smith wanted to ensure its superiority by adding more floors and developing it into a dirigible dock. However, challenges arose as the building's steel frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the docking of a thousand-foot dirigible, which would add significant stress to the structure. Despite investing sixty-thousand dollars into refining the frame, the building still faced structural issues.  Moreover, safety concerns emerged due to the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles, posing a risk to the building and its occupants. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further hindering the plans for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, Governor Al Smith had to abandon the project as the safety risks and legal restrictions proved insurmountable. Consequently, the Empire State Building remained without a dirigible dock, solidifying its place in history as an iconic skyscraper without aerial docking capabilities.
453	15286	6	3	The challenges of using dirigibles as a mode of travel, such as the flammability of hydrogen gas and laws against flying low over urban areas, posed significant safety risks for the Empire State Building as a potential pit stop for these airships. The presence of hydrogen in many dirigibles from outside the United States meant that any mishap could result in a dangerous fire hazard. Additionally, strict regulations prevented airships from flying too close to populated areas, limiting the feasibility of using the iconic skyscraper as a docking station. The unpredictable nature of wind patterns in urban environments further compounded the potential dangers, as strong gusts could easily cause a blimp to collide with surrounding buildings. These factors ultimately led to the abandonment of the Empire State Building as a stopover for dirigibles, highlighting the impracticalities and risks associated with this early form of air travel.
454	15287	6	3	The obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire were safety, nature, and U.S law. Safety was a major concern due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside the United States. Additionally, the shifting winds on top of the building posed a challenge as violent air currents could make docking difficult. Moreover, U.S law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the Empire State Building or even approach the vicinity. These obstacles collectively hindered the possibility of dirigibles docking at the iconic skyscraper, showcasing the complex interplay between safety regulations, natural elements, and legal restrictions in aviation.
455	15288	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the @CAPS1 faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was that the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These challenges made it difficult for the @CAPS1 to successfully dock at the mooring mast. The unpredictable movement of the ship around the mast, combined with the ever-changing winds, created a hazardous environment for the crew and passengers. Despite these obstacles, the @CAPS1 crew persevered in their attempts to secure the airship to the mooring mast, showcasing their determination and skill in the face of adversity."
456	15289	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In planning for the mast, builders did not account for the high winds, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The greatest reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its purpose was because of safety issues. Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin, Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Owners of the Empire State Building then recognized that if the same incident were to take place in New York, more lives would be lost. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to recognize the dangers of the mooring mast, ultimately leading to its inability to serve its intended purpose.
457	15290	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a couple of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they encountered was the stress that the dirigibles' load would exert on the structure of the building. This necessitated careful calculations and reinforcement to ensure that the building could support the weight without compromising its integrity. Additionally, another obstacle they faced was the need to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the landing of dirigibles. This modification was essential to create a safe and functional docking area for the airships. By addressing these challenges, the builders were able to successfully make the Empire State Building accessible for dirigibles to dock, showcasing innovation and adaptability in the face of new technology.
458	15291	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" the challenges in establishing dirigible docks were evident. Before adding the mooring mast to the Empire State Building, modifications were required to ensure the building's frame could withstand the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible tethered to it. Safety concerns arose due to the flammability of hydrogen used in many dirigibles, exemplified by the Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The potential devastation of such an incident over a densely populated area like downtown New York was a sobering realization. Additionally, the unpredictability of nature, specifically shifting winds, posed a significant obstacle. Even if a dirigible reached the mooring mast, it could swivel uncontrollably. While weights could be utilized to stabilize the dirigible, the safety risks of dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street were deemed impractical. These challenges highlighted the complexity and risks involved in achieving the goal of establishing dirigible docks, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions and careful considerations to ensure safety and feasibility."
459	15292	6	3	The obstacles the engineers faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that they needed a strong enough cable so it could support the blimp, the passengers, and any additional weight. Another challenge was figuring out how to achieve this with the power of the wind at such high altitudes. Additionally, they had to consider the possibility of pedestrians being present at the docking area, as well as the structural requirements for buildings to support the docking process. These obstacles required careful planning and innovative solutions to ensure the safety and efficiency of dirigible docking operations.
460	15293	6	3	"In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the obstacles faced was that putting a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. This made the builders have to modify the frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flamable."" This would put great danger to the people of New York. That was a huge problem the builders faced. The builders at the Empire state Building faced many obstacles but safety and reconstruction were just some of those problems. The challenges encountered during the construction and planning process of the mooring mast highlight the complexity and importance of ensuring structural integrity and public safety in ambitious architectural projects."
461	15294	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to land there due to the constant change in wind direction. They considered adding heavy weights to the ends of the blimps, but this posed safety concerns for pedestrians below. Additionally, the building had to reach a certain height to eliminate the airship height rule. If not, the risk of explosions in the heavily populated city of New York would be significant. While the mast for dirigibles seemed like a revolutionary idea in theory, it was ultimately deemed impractical in reality.
462	15295	6	3	There were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, as a thousand-foot dirigible moored there would add stress to the building's frame. Additionally, making the mooring mast fulfill its purpose was challenging due to the constantly shifting winds on top of the building caused by violent air currents. These challenges made it difficult for the builders to create a functional and safe docking system for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building.
463	15296	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to face was the constant change in nature and how it could affect the dirigibles. The dirigibles would ""swivel around"" because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could put pedestrians on the street in danger because the ship is on top moving and could be unstable. Another obstacle is safety. Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Other countries ships could set on fire in the United States and put people in danger. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet and loading off could be unstable because of the winds. The last obstacle faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore it was illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the buildings safely. All these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger."
464	15297	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in regards to dirigibles. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it challenging for dirigibles to navigate safely. Additionally, dirigibles dangling on top of the building posed a threat to pedestrians below. Moreover, laws regulating airships prohibited them from flying too low or too high, further complicating the use of dirigibles near the Empire State Building. These obstacles had to be carefully navigated to ensure the safety of both air traffic and pedestrians in the vicinity of the iconic building.
465	15298	6	3	When the architects and builders were planning on how to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced many obstacles. An example of an obstacle they faced was they had to construct the mast so it wouldn't fall off when a dirigible docked. They couldn't use a cable tether to hold the mast down because it put too much stress on the building's frame and foundation. Another obstacle the builders had to face was how to strengthen the Empire State Building's frame. In order to get the Empire State Building's frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face. The challenges of ensuring structural integrity while accommodating the mast's weight and movement highlight the intricate planning and engineering involved in this iconic construction project.
466	15299	6	3	In the building of @ORGANIZATION1 gets very competitive. He wants to construct the biggest building in New York City. When the construction was going on he wanted to add a top or hat so that the mast would be able to drop off people directly into the building. But then there was a problem they had to consult it to allow it. Irving then let Al know that the building wasn't going to be done on time, because of the mast. That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction. However, after careful consideration and consultation, the necessary approvals were obtained, and the construction continued. Despite the initial setback, the Empire State Building was eventually completed and became an iconic landmark in the New York City skyline, showcasing the perseverance and innovation of its builders.
467	15300	6	3	Throughout the designing and construction stages of the Empire State Building's mooring mast, builders and engineers confronted many issues including the distribution of building stress, fire hazards, and the constant shifting caused by winds. During the planning stages, engineers realized that attaching a thousand-foot dirigible to the top of the building with a single cable tether would add immense stress to the frame, requiring costly redesigning and modifications to the foundation and framework.   After the completion of the mooring mast, the issue of fire hazards became apparent, as American dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium. The catastrophic burning of a dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey, raised concerns about the potential dangers in a densely populated area like New York City.  Furthermore, the violent air currents in New York posed a challenge, causing the rear of dirigibles to sway unpredictably. The proposed solution of using lead blocks to weigh down the back was deemed impractical and unsafe, leaving engineers and builders scrambling for alternative options.  In conclusion, the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast presented various complex challenges that required innovative solutions to ensure the safety and stability of the iconic structure.
468	15301	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the tremendous stress that would be placed on the building's foundation if a dirigible was moored by a single tether, as it would have to bear the weight of the dirigible and withstand wind pressure from such great heights. Additionally, the flammability of hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles posed a significant risk, especially after the tragic destruction of the Hindenburg highlighted the potential dangers of using this gas over a densely populated area like New York City. Moreover, violent wind currents would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel, making it difficult to stabilize the ship without endangering pedestrians on the street below. Due to these obstacles, the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never utilized to dock blimps, as the safety risks and structural challenges were too great to overcome.
469	15302	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were numerous. Safety concerns for both the city and the dirigibles themselves were paramount, especially considering the highly flammable nature of hydrogen gas used by most dirigibles from outside the United States. The tragic destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in 1937 highlighted the potential dangers of such incidents occurring above densely populated areas like downtown New York. Moreover, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building posed a significant challenge, causing the back end of dirigibles attempting to dock to swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast. Additionally, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas further complicated the feasibility of using the Empire State Building as a mooring station for dirigibles. Ultimately, these obstacles proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the building's intended purpose as a docking station for airships.
470	15303	6	3	Constructing the world's tallest building to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges for the workers. The constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents made it difficult and unsafe for dirigibles to approach the building. Moreover, the structure of the building had to be reinforced to withstand the added stress of the dirigibles docking. Safety was also a major concern, especially with dirigibles filled with highly flammable hydrogen potentially posing a danger to the population below. These obstacles required careful planning and execution to ensure the successful modification of the Empire State Building for dirigible docking.
471	15304	6	3	The Empire State Building was and is the tallest building to ever be built. To make it the tallest building Architects had to design the Mooring Mast. In building this mast there were many obstacles to overcome, but even with those obstacles it was still finished. The Mooring Mast was needed because without it the Empire State Building would not be the tallest in the world. To make the Mooring Mast work the builders had to overcome some obstacles. One of the main obstacles was to add on the Mast they would have to attach steal from the Mast all the way down to the foundation. Another was After designing the Mast they had to change the original plans for the building. Despite these challenges, the builders successfully completed the Mooring Mast, allowing the Empire State Building to stand as a symbol of architectural and engineering achievement for generations to come.
472	15305	6	3	Builders faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Safety concerns were paramount, especially considering that most Dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The risk of a potential fire breaking out over New York City and causing widespread devastation was too great to ignore.   Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the winds on top of the Empire State Building posed a significant challenge. The constant shifting of winds would cause the Dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, creating a dangerous situation for both passengers and bystanders. The use of black lead weights to weigh down the Dirigibles also added to the risk, as the dangling weights posed a threat to those below.  Ultimately, the construction of the mooring mast proved to be too dangerous and impractical, leading to the abandonment of the idea. Today, the area where the mooring mast was intended to be located serves as a tea and soda area for sightseers, a reminder of the ambitious but ultimately unfeasible plan.
473	15306	6	3	On @DATE1, The Empire State Building was announced to reach the height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the architect of the building mentioned that the top would be more than ornamental. It was said that this amazing dream would come true for aviation pioneers. The building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships called dirigibles, otherwise known as blimps. This was thought out to be a great idea. Things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it was ever constructed. Reasons being; Most blimps from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel, and it would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building. Thus, still leaving the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, but never completing the original goal. The grand vision of having a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building was not realized due to safety concerns and practical limitations, ultimately highlighting the importance of thorough planning and consideration in architectural endeavors.
474	15307	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the empire state building. First of all for it to be a 1,454 ft building it would have to have a very strong base to support it and they had to reinforce the base too to be able to mount the mooring mast on top. They also faced issues with the strong air currents that flowed above New York. None of the dirigibles were able to dock because of the high current. The mooring mast also placed stress on the frame. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" this proves proves how much difficulty the builders were going to have with the construction of the Empire state building. Additionally, the sheer height of the building presented challenges in terms of logistics and safety for the workers. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic Empire State Building, which stands as a testament to human ingenuity and determination."
475	15308	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed ballons they can travel for long periods at time of seventy miles per hour. Thoogh dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of travelin modernation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there many thoughout changes in the building needed to be considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure. To suit the buildings with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @MONEY1. Many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable were to much of a risk in the high populated are of New York. Also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" A quote by Al Smith. The obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the empire state Building. Ultimately, the challenges in safety, structural modifications, and legal restrictions proved to be insurmountable, leading to the conclusion that the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not feasible."
476	15309	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their efforts to make it possible for dirigibles to dock on the mast. One problem was safety. Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is, according to the article, ""highly flammable."" A dirigible catching fire right over a very populated area would be dangerous. Nature was another factor. ""Violent air currents"" made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock. Yet even if these frustrating conditions were not extant, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was illegal. A law prohibited ""airships [from] flying too low over urban areas,"" which included dirigibles. These obstacles were overlooked in the plans to create the Empire State Building. Despite the challenges faced by the builders, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and determination."
477	15310	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Some dirigibles did try, but due to wind and safety reasons the idea was dropped. The safety of all human beings took part in the construction, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". When dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things. Mother Nature can be a funny thing, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting..."". With the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be hard for a ship to land. When building something always be prepared for obstacles. The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles highlight the importance of considering safety regulations, international differences, and the unpredictable nature of weather in construction projects."
478	15311	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currents were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building.
479	15312	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronomical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are too many obstacles prohibiting it.
480	15313	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building envisioned leading dirigibles moor at the top, there were some critical flaws. For one thing, a thousand foot dirigible moored to such a small focal point with the wind pressure and its own load would exert enormous pressure on the building's frame. This could potentially lead to the building's collapse is due to the strain. Another reason was at such high altitudes, the wind is quite violent and would sway the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither ""... practical nor safe."" If something went wrong, the dirigible could take out another building or worse: fall. A more practical, legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities. A dirigible mooring to a mast, even at that height, was illegal. Therefore, with so many obstacles it was deemed impractical to use the Empire State Building as a high-altitude dock. Despite the initial vision, the challenges of structural integrity, safety concerns, and legal regulations ultimately made the idea unfeasible."
481	15314	6	3	There are many problems with trying to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building. First, there was a German dirigible called the Hindenburg that caught fire due to the hydrogen. Having a dirigible go up in flames over dense New York would result in many lives lost. Second, the wind 1,250 feet in the air is very strong and unpredictable. There was no way to be sure that the dirigibles could even dock or be controlled once docked. Lastly, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be against the law for a dirigible to be so close to a building with so many people in it. Since these problems all could result in deaths, the idea was thrown out. Additionally, the structural integrity of the Empire State Building may not have been able to handle the weight and strain of a dirigible docking, posing a risk of damage or collapse. Furthermore, the noise and disturbance caused by the airship docking and taking off could disrupt the daily activities of the building and its occupants, creating further safety and logistical concerns. In conclusion, while the concept of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building may seem intriguing, the numerous safety, regulatory, and practical challenges make it an unfeasible and risky proposition.
482	15315	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the beginning, the builders thought it would be a great idea to let dirigibles (also known as blimps) dock at the building. However, they soon realized the challenges they would encounter. They didn't anticipate the wind pressure and the stress that the blimp's load would exert on the building. The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This required over $1 million worth of modifications to the building's framework. Safety was another major concern, as most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, rather than helium. A fire could have been disastrous over the populated area of downtown New York. Additionally, the winds posed a problem, as even when the blimp was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship could swing around, potentially causing a dangerous accident. Furthermore, there were laws against low-flying ships that needed to be considered. The architects of the Empire State Building should have thoroughly evaluated these factors before proceeding with the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock there.
483	15316	6	3	In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome various obstacles. One major challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of safer helium. This posed a significant safety risk, especially in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of the winds, constantly shifting due to violent air currents, proved to be the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. With these challenges in mind, the builders ultimately realized that the plan was not feasible in the face of such obstacles.
484	15317	6	3	The empire State building builders faced a couple of Problems of docking dirigibles to the mooring mast. Some, I don't even know, I'll just buildup from here & what  The dirigible. Now I never learned about the  of a zeppelin, but I do know one thing. Do  get out from the front, or sides? I  The mast itself. This thing was a failure from the . (don't question why I chose Something else for one of the multi- questions). The reason why is that  many things could go wrong. This thing can , &  fall off unless  do something really special for forging a building this high. Overall, it's been a long while, anyways these problems, & Several others that I forgot to mention for obvious reasons are  the reason why we don't use zeppelins as much anymore. The challenges faced in docking dirigibles to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, including issues with the dirigible structure and the instability of the mast, have contributed to the decline in the use of zeppelins in modern times.
485	15318	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 describes how safety, laws, and nature are the three main obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the greatest reason that dirigibles could not be docked in @ORGANIZATION2. The biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. A German dirigible had recently been destroyed in a fire in New Jersey because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State building realized that the accident would have been far worse if it had occurred, ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) and by docking dirigibles there, they run the risk that it could happen. Nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were always causing winds to change, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street, ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from, ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to get around. The obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it impossible to dock dirigibles to the mooring mast on the building. Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns, legal restrictions, and the unpredictable forces of nature rendered the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unattainable."
486	15319	6	3	The building had a steel framed body up to 100 floors with glass windows reaching up to the 102nd floor. In addition to this, they had to upgrade the building to withstand the stress imposed by the blimps that pass by.
487	15320	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was designing a mooring mast that could withstand the stress of the dirigible's load. The steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this additional pressure. Another significant obstacle was the strong winds on top of the building, which caused the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. This posed a safety risk to pedestrians below, as weighing down the back of the ship was not a viable solution. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building or even approach the vicinity. These obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea of using a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
488	15321	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Initially, they had to figure out how to install a mooring mast on top of the building without compromising its structural integrity. This required significant modifications to the steel frame to ensure that it could support the added weight and stress.  Another major concern was the use of hydrogen in many dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The builders were worried about the potential dangers posed by docking hydrogen-filled airships in a densely populated area like New York City, especially after the tragic accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, where a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire.  Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of the winds around the building posed a significant challenge. Unlike in open fields where dirigibles could be weighed down with lead weights, mooring them on top of the Empire State Building would have them swaying high above the streets, endangering pedestrians and civilians below.  Overall, the builders had to navigate through a series of obstacles, from structural modifications to safety concerns, in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, these challenges proved too great, and the idea of using the building as a docking station for airships was abandoned.
489	15322	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their quest to create a masterpiece. The competitive nature of the construction industry, coupled with unrealistic expectations for the building, presented significant challenges. As the Chrysler building rose in the skyline, the Empire State Building aimed to surpass it by adding a mooring mast for dirigibles. However, the addition of the mooring mast required extensive planning and rebuilding of the building's frame to support the weight and movement of a docking dirigible. Additionally, the architects overlooked the potential danger of hydrogen-fueled dirigibles docking at the building, as the flammable gas posed a threat to the safety of those below. Despite these obstacles, the architects were determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest and most iconic structure in the world.
490	15323	6	3	In summary, the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. They could not drop a mooring mast on the flat roof due to the stress it would add to the building's frame. Attaching a thousand-foot dirigible would require transmitting the load and wind pressure all the way to the foundation, nearly 1,000 feet below. Moreover, it was unsafe to have highly flammable dirigibles hovering above a densely populated area. Nature itself posed a challenge as the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsuitable for docking in such a location. Ultimately, these obstacles made it clear that dirigibles should be landing in open fields rather than above city streets to ensure the safety of pedestrians below.
491	15324	6	3	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First, having something as large as a dirigible land on a 1,250-foot building would add significant stress to the building's frame. This stress would need to be distributed throughout the entire structure, which was a challenging feat. To make the building suitable for this additional weight, it would cost over $60,000, a considerable amount considering the other expenses involved. These were just a few of the obstacles the builders encountered in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the iconic Empire State Building.
492	15325	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced challenges when trying to accommodate dirigibles due to the high cost of over sixty thousand dollars for necessary modifications. Simply placing a mooring mast on the flat roof was not feasible as the structure needed reinforcement to handle the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible. Strengthening and modifying the steel frame of the building were essential to support the dirigibles as intended.
493	15326	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly the idea was just not practical. Having an up to 1,000-foot blimp full of flammable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in New York their death tolls would be huge.  Along with the extreme perils that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed too many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.  Overall, the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.
494	15327	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the design of the mooring and the modifications needed to make the building strong enough to withstand the wind pressure and load of the dirigible. The mast also had to be able to hold the dirigible down with just one cable tether, putting significant stress on the structure. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles from outside the United States posed a fire hazard, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to approach or dock at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, these obstacles proved too difficult to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the idea of dirigibles docking at the building.
495	15328	6	3	"There are a few obstacles the builders had to face in this project. One of them was building the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building. The architect of the Chrysler building made it 46 ft taller. When this was done, the builder needed to make the Empire State building taller, but make it something ""as mundane as a water tank"" (Al Smith). Another obstacle was trying to make it a stop for dirigibles, which could go up to 2 miles per hour and were as long as 1,000 ft. This would take up several blocks in New York City, and they didn't have a good landing area. A third obstacle they faced was nature. The wind was always blowing, and hanging dirigibles over a city of innocent people was very dangerous."
496	15329	6	3	While planning this architectural masterpiece, builders faced many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations. The first big problem was the large amounts of stress to the framework of the building when the zepplins would be moored to the top, also the amount of pull would impact the foundation as well. The second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework. Safety was a huge issue as well; most blimps are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, also if it were to explode it is floating over one of the largest cities in the country. With New York City's geographical positioning the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly shift directions which could cause the zepplin to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly too low over highly populated urban cities. The risks and challenges associated with having a mooring mast on the Empire State Building ultimately led to the abandonment of this ambitious plan.
497	15330	6	3	Four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first obstacle was the need for a more complex mooring mast, specifically designed for the building, rather than the standard masts used in open fields. This would require significant modifications to the existing structure of the Empire State Building. Additionally, the docking of a dirigible would put immense stress on the building's frame, necessitating the reinforcement of the steel framework.  Another major concern was the flammability of the hydrogen used in dirigibles, posing a significant risk of fire and explosions, especially over a densely populated area like New York City. Furthermore, even if the mooring mast was successfully installed, the strong winds at such heights could cause the back end of the dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making docking challenging and potentially hazardous.  Moreover, the use of lead weights to stabilize the airship was not feasible due to the danger they would pose to civilians below. Lastly, regulations prohibiting airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas could have further hindered the possibility of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.  In conclusion, the combination of these obstacles made it impractical and unsafe for dirigibles to ever moor on top of the Empire State Building, despite some attempts coming close to achieving this feat.
498	15331	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced obstacles in constructing ""The Mooring Mast,"" particularly concerning safety and legal restrictions. The use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles posed a significant risk to lives, as most airships outside the U.S. utilized this gas. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, hindering the possibility of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building. Despite being the tallest structure in New York, the building's height of over 1,250 feet created strong winds at the top, making it challenging for dirigibles to safely approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles struggled to dock due to forceful winds, highlighting the difficulties faced in utilizing the mooring mast."
499	15332	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was the amount of modifications that needed to be made to the building's framework. The other obstacle they faced was the fact that most countries outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, making it impossible for dirigibles to stop in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. A last obstacle they faced was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These challenges made it difficult for the Empire State Building to become a docking station for dirigibles, highlighting the complexities involved in such a project.
500	15333	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" (para 6). The swinging of the dirigibles body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads. Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. The workers had to work for another two months after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders worked hard to suit the new building for the docking of dirigibles. Unfortunately, their work was for nothing as the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building was never successfully implemented due to safety concerns and the development of more advanced aircraft."
501	15334	6	3	Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building created many obstacles for its builders. Some of which weren't even discovered until finally attempting to do it. The first of the builders' problems started with trying to prepare the actual building for the added stress that would be applied when having dirigibles try to dock. They spent around $1 million on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building. Then, rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower, creating lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as obstacles. There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Finally, the builders found out the biggest obstacle, which is that it is not legal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically, they weren't even allowed to do what they did. Thinking back on it, it is obvious to see that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to these challenges and legal restrictions.
502	15335	6	3	"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Another obstacle was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made the mast nearly useless. Additionally, foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the dirigible called ""The Hindenburg"" was destroyed, the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. These obstacles posed significant challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there."
503	15336	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the risk of fire due to the highly flammable hydrogen used in dirigibles from outside the U.S., as opposed to the safer helium. Additionally, the shifting winds caused by violent air currents presented a challenge, as the back of the dirigible would swivel around unpredictably. Attempts to stabilize the dirigible with weights at the back posed safety concerns for pedestrians on the street below. Furthermore, laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. These challenges made it difficult for the builders to successfully implement a docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
504	15337	6	3	The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was very high. The men who built the massive structure should've realized that these expectations were unrealistic. Al Smith had planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off/pick up passengers while docked at the Empire State Building. These plans would never manifest because dirigibles were powered by hydrogen, which is highly flammable, posing a significant risk of disaster. Additionally, the winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong, making it impossible for dirigibles to safely dock. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting aircraft from flying at such low altitudes over urban areas, further hindering the feasibility of the docking plans. The tragic incident involving the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of using dirigibles for docking purposes in metropolitan areas. The owners of the Empire State Building came to the realization that the plans for dirigibles to dock on the building were not only impractical but also unsafe. Ultimately, the grand vision of dirigibles gracefully mooring at the Empire State Building never came to fruition due to the insurmountable challenges posed by nature and regulations.
505	15338	6	3	The wind was a huge issue when building the Empire State Building. The building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable. If they used dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads. That plan was not smart or safe. The purpose to build it higher was just so it could be the tallest building, there was really no good reasons for it. Additionally, the height of the building made it susceptible to high winds, creating potential safety hazards for both workers and pedestrians below. This risk further emphasized the impracticality of utilizing dirigibles for transportation or any other purpose on the Empire State Building. Overall, the decision to build the Empire State Building to be the tallest structure at the time presented various challenges, with wind resistance being a primary concern that needed to be addressed during construction.
506	15339	6	3	Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications. Safety was a major concern, especially when considering the harsh winds that would be encountered. The idea of the mast presented its own set of challenges, as the concept of attaching a heavy object to just a tether was not without risk. Additionally, the presence of combustible gases added another layer of danger, putting downtown New York at risk. Landing a dirigible on the small roof would be difficult, especially with the strong winds present. Guiding the dirigible for a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous due to the unpredictable nature of the winds. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building had to navigate through various obstacles and risks when constructing the mooring mast.
507	15340	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in its attempt to accommodate dirigibles. The building's flat roof posed structural challenges, as mooring a dirigible to it would place excessive stress on the frame. Modifications to strengthen the building would come at a high cost of over sixty thousand dollars. Safety concerns also arose due to the flammability of hydrogen used in some dirigibles. In the event of an accident, the use of hydrogen in New York could have catastrophic consequences. Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of the winds presented a significant obstacle. Even if tethered to the mooring mast, the dirigible would not be securely anchored, posing a serious safety risk. Ultimately, the Empire State Building was unable to fulfill its intended purpose of serving as a docking station for dirigibles."
508	15341	6	3	Another obstacle that the builders faced with the construction of the mooring mast was the potential risk of a Hindenburg-like accident. Some dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, and a disaster in a densely populated area like downtown New York could have catastrophic consequences. Additionally, the high force winds on top of the Empire State Building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. While weights could be used to stabilize the dirigible, they would hang over pedestrians, posing a significant safety hazard. Overall, the challenges of adding a mooring mast to the Empire State Building were not only structural but also safety concerns that would need to be carefully addressed.
509	15342	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. One major challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City for the airships. Additionally, the design of the mooring mast itself posed difficulties, as the shifting winds on top of the building made it challenging to tether the dirigibles securely. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to approach or dock at the Empire State Building. Despite these obstacles, efforts were made to overcome these challenges and make the docking of dirigibles at the building a reality.
510	15343	6	3	the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for a reason that should have been apparent before it was even constructed. The main issue was one of safety: most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. As a result, the mooring mast would have posed a significant risk to any airship attempting to dock there. This oversight highlights the importance of thoroughly considering all potential risks and implications before embarking on ambitious projects. In this case, the safety concerns surrounding the mooring mast ultimately rendered it unusable, serving as a cautionary tale for future endeavors.
511	15344	6	3	In the 1930's, the idea of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was popular. However, various obstacles hindered this plan. Existing air traffic laws prohibited airships from tying up to the Empire State Building or flying near it due to safety concerns. The destruction of the Hindenburg highlighted the dangers of hydrogen dirigibles, especially over a populated area like downtown New York City. Furthermore, strong winds posed a significant risk to moored dirigibles, as they could not be anchored too low in the air. Additionally, the steel frame of the building would need modifications to withstand the added stress of a moored dirigible. Overall, the idea of mooring dirigibles to the Empire State Building was deemed unrealistic and unsafe, given the numerous challenges and risks involved.
512	15345	6	3	"Builders faced many obstacles such as safety, nature, flammability and law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mast. The first problem is ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose."" The dirigibles also, use hydrogen not helium, which is very flammable. The Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [it] could have been if it [happened] over densely populated area such as New York. The violent air currents also played a role, the back of the ship would swivel around and around. When dirigibles moored in landing fields they would be weighted down with lead weights, which would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There was no way dirigibles would be able to dock at the mast. Additionally, the structural integrity of the mast itself was questioned, as it needed to support the weight and forces of a massive dirigible. Furthermore, the logistics of maneuvering a large airship in a busy city environment posed a significant challenge. Despite the grand vision of using the mast as a docking station for dirigibles, the practical implications and risks involved ultimately made it an unattainable goal."
513	15346	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the iconic skyscraper in New York. One of the challenges was ensuring the structural integrity of the building to support the weight of the dirigible without compromising its stability. This required transferring the weight of the dirigible, which could sway in the wind, to the bottom of the building, nearly eleven hundred feet below. However, the most formidable obstacle was the unpredictable and violent air currents at the building's height, which would cause the dirigible to dangerously veer off course while attempting to dock. Ultimately, due to these dangers and obstacles, the Empire State Building was never utilized as originally intended for dirigible transport.
514	15347	6	3	While designing and building the mooring mast atop the Empire State building, the engineers seem to have ignored some seemingly useful information. As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit and board safely. Also if the law itself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then it's game over. Why even bother if it's illegal? Although it seems like a futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, too many things prevented the idea from prevailing. The potential risks and legal constraints associated with mooring a dirigible at such heights were major obstacles that the engineers overlooked, leading to the impracticality of the concept.
515	15348	6	3	There were many obstacles that the Empire State building's owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added a mooring mast to increase the building's height. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be expanded to add more height to the building, costing over $1 million. The main reason, and obstacle, was safety. The owner had to ensure that the dirigible was not flammable, which it was. Wind and nature also played a significant role in the decision-making process. The strong winds would cause the dirigible to swing and shift, potentially endangering people on the streets of New York. Ultimately, the idea of landing dirigibles on top of the Empire State building was deemed neither safe nor practical, with too many struggles and obstacles for such a plan to be feasible.
516	15349	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders in strengthening the Empire State Building to support the weight of dirigibles, another obstacle arose due to the lack of appropriate docking equipment on the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles did not have the necessary tools to securely dock at the mooring mast, leading to difficulties in the docking process. Furthermore, the swinging motion of the dirigibles when docked posed a safety concern, requiring careful consideration and modifications to ensure a stable and secure docking experience. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles outside of the United States presented a significant risk, as hydrogen is highly flammable. This raised concerns about the safety of having flammable materials in close proximity to the building. These various challenges required careful planning and modifications to overcome, highlighting the complexities involved in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
517	15350	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there due to the dirigibles' heavy load causing stress on the structure and the wind pressure needing to be transmitted to the building's foundation. Despite using an electric winch for docking, the dirigible swinging in the breeze presented a safety concern.
518	15351	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This shows that docking dirigibles can be harmful as some buildings and many people can be negatively affected. The large business district is too densely populated to allow such a thing. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This obstacle builders faced brought up that lives are yet again in danger, not to mention very expensive damage that allowing dirigibles can cause. Another obstacle builders faced was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All of these obstacles that the builders faced were very important and paved the way for the idea of dirigibles to be docked attop of the Empire State Building to be disarmed. The dangers involved were too significance and the top of the building now much safer purposes. Ultimately, the decision to abandon the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was a wise choice, considering the numerous safety risks and obstacles that would have posed a threat to both the building and its surrounding areas."
519	15352	6	3	"There were many problems with the designing of the dirigible docking system. The first of these problems comes from the practicality of the concept. The winds created by the updrafts in the cities are violent and making landing a blimp too risky, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle that was faced was the structural design. The Empire State Building was not originally designed to moor blimps, and modifying the building to do so was expensive, ""over $1 million worth of modifications."" The final obstacle was the fact that there were laws in place stopping airships from flying too low over buildings, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These impracticalities proved to be challenging obstacles that needed to be addressed in order to successfully implement a dirigible docking system on the Empire State Building."
520	15353	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building had a grand vision to make New York the leader in modern travel by adding a mooring mast for dirigibles. However, this plan was met with unexpected challenges that ultimately prevented it from becoming a reality. Despite redesigning the building's support structure to accommodate the mast, the architects failed to anticipate the difficulties that would arise.  One major issue was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles from outside the U.S., which posed a significant fire risk. This safety concern made it impractical to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Additionally, the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would have made it too dangerous for dirigibles to dock, further complicating the original plan.  As a result of these unforeseen obstacles, the Empire State Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose of becoming a hub for air travel. Despite the architects' ambitious goals, the challenges they faced ultimately prevented the building from achieving its full potential in the realm of modern transportation.
521	15354	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles during construction, according to the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. The biggest obstacle of allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there were the forces of nature, such as wind and gravity. As mentioned in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air. Furthermore, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp posed a significant problem; having a potential fire hazard that was @NUM1 feet long floating over a densely populated area like New York City was highly risky. Additionally, regulations prohibited airships from flying too close over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of using the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. A test conducted with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles demonstrated the impracticality and danger of the concept, as the dirigible could not even approach close enough to dock securely. In conclusion, while the mooring mast over the Empire State Building was a brilliant concept, numerous obstacles, including unpredictable winds, flammability risks, and regulatory restrictions, ultimately prevented its practical implementation."
522	15355	6	3	Architects faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One major issue was the need to add a mooring mast to the building, requiring significant structural modifications to support it. Additionally, the risk of a dirigible accident, such as the Hindenburg disaster, posed a serious threat to the densely populated city below. However, the most significant challenge came from the unpredictable nature of the winds surrounding the building. Violent winds could cause a tethered dirigible to swing dangerously, potentially endangering pedestrians below. Given these risks, architects ultimately decided against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building to ensure the safety of the public.
523	15356	6	3	When attempting to add a mooring mask to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one. Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City. The drigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be. Additionally, the builders had to consider the strong winds at the height of the building, which could make mooring a dirigible challenging and potentially dangerous. Moreover, the weight and size of the mooring mask itself posed a risk of destabilizing the building's structure. In light of these factors, the idea of a dirigible mooring dock on the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed unfeasible and abandoned.
524	15357	6	3	There were many obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch. The greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, was neither practical nor safe. The one obstacle to their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. However, the challenge of managing the unpredictable and strong air currents remained a significant hurdle to overcome in the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
525	15358	6	3	Additionally, the builders had to consider the challenge of strong winds at such a height, which could make it difficult for dirigibles to safely approach and dock at the mast. Engineers had to come up with innovative solutions to ensure that the mast could withstand these powerful winds without compromising the structural integrity of the building. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully constructed a mast atop the Empire State Building that could accommodate dirigibles, showcasing their determination and ingenuity in overcoming challenges. Ultimately, the Empire State Building became a symbol of modern engineering and a testament to human achievement in the face of adversity.
526	15359	6	3	There were a few obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible is a blimp, giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. Dirigibles had a lack of suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company. After all those obstacles they could finally build the mooring mast. The addition of the mooring mast to the Empire State Building not only provided a solution to the lack of suitable landing areas for dirigibles in New York but also marked a significant advancement in airship technology and transportation.
527	15360	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the challenges faced in building a docking station for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Originally intended to simply add height to the building, Al Smith proposed the mast serve a higher purpose. However, the structural changes required to support the dirigibles' weight posed a significant challenge. Additionally, the risk of a dirigible falling from the sky onto pedestrians below was a major concern. Furthermore, the legal restrictions on airships flying over urban areas presented another obstacle to the docking idea. Despite the noble intention, the obstacles highlighted in ""The Mooring Mast"" illustrate the impracticality of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building."
528	15361	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at each stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical.
529	15362	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that a thousand-foot dirigibe moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. Also the stress of the dirigibe's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. It would need to transmitted to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars. This significant cost would be necessary to ensure the safety and structural integrity of the building while accommodating dirigibles to dock.
530	15363	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were indeed challenging. In addition to ensuring the building's height did not cause it to tilt, they also had to contend with competition to construct the tallest building in the world. Despite these challenges, the workers persevered and ultimately succeeded in creating a monumental structure that would stand as a symbol of engineering prowess and architectural achievement for years to come.
531	15364	6	3	Builders faced numerous challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. The weight and wind pressure of the dirigibles would add stress to the building, which needed to be transmitted down to the foundation over 1,000 feet. Additionally, most American dirigibles used highly flammable helium for lift, posing a significant safety risk over crowded New York streets. Nature also presented obstacles, with wind currents potentially pushing dirigibles into buildings, causing damage or punctures. Existing regulations prohibiting low-flying aircraft further complicated the feasibility of the mooring system. Ultimately, these challenges, encompassing construction, safety, regulatory issues, and natural elements, led to the abandonment of the docking concept on the Empire State Building.
532	15365	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new friends would have to include more money. Anything done so top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the @DATE1 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind, Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely."
533	15366	6	3	Many obstacles were encountered while attempting to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was a challenging and lengthy process that required careful consideration. Workers could not simply place a mooring mast on the building's roof. The one thousand-foot dirigible was secured at the top of the building by a single cable tether, putting additional strain on the structure. Architects had to design a tower made of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel that would be illuminated from within. The tower had a stepped-back design that mirrored the overall shape of the building. However, it was later discovered that dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building due to laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Architects faced numerous challenges in constructing the masts, highlighting the complexities of the project.
534	15367	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges when it came to accommodating dirigibles. One major concern was the potential risk of a dirigible catching fire while attempting to dock, posing a serious threat to those below on the streets. Additionally, the strong winds at the top of the tower could cause the dirigible to sway uncontrollably when tethered to the mooring mast, creating a dangerous situation for both the dirigible and the surrounding area. Furthermore, it was crucial to ensure that no airships flying at lower altitudes could enter the vicinity of the building to prevent any potential collisions or disturbances. These obstacles required careful planning and innovative solutions to safely incorporate dirigibles into the Empire State Building's operations.
535	15368	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains the Empire State buildings past construction which led it to be the tallest building in the United States. Although the builder Al Smith had many obstacles, they faced one of the hardest ones when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles is allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle is letting dirigibles dock because they need a place to tie up to a mast. It is stated, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast"" (L¸sted). This can be a problem because the body of the mast could swing in a lot of breeze. Although there were many obstacles, Al Smith worked his way around them and proceeded to finish the Empire State building with courage to take on all obstacles."
536	15369	6	3	The architectural, chemical, and legal challenges surrounding the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building presented significant obstacles. Despite the enthusiasm of Al Smith and John Tauranac, it was clear that the mast would place undue stress on the building's frame, requiring a substantial financial investment. Moreover, the flammability of hydrogen used in foreign dirigibles posed a serious safety risk, with the potential for a catastrophic explosion above the city. Additionally, existing laws prohibited dirigibles from coming near the building, further complicating the feasibility of the project. In light of these factors, the impracticality of the mooring mast should have been evident from the start, highlighting the challenges that ultimately led to its failure.
537	15370	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were difficult. One of the obstacles they faced was fixing the Empire State Building, and the cost was high. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. However, the plan never fully went through because safety was a significant issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets were significant risks that could not be ignored. Additionally, it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building impossible to realize.
538	15371	6	3	The architects encountered few issues during the construction process. According to @LOCATION1, the stress from the Dirigibles Load proved to be too much for the building, necessitating over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. Apart from this, they also had to redesign and then construct it.
539	15372	6	3	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast,"" there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One problem was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure on the building's foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" @CAPS1, this was a big obstacle for the landing process of the dirigibles. Another problem they had was that dirigibles use hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it had caught fire, it would not have been good for a populated city. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill it's purpose. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If the dirigible caught the building on fire, many people's lives would be in complete danger. In conclusion, the Mooring Mast did not work out for many reasons, but safety and the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation were two big obstacles for allowing dirigibles to dock. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles posed a significant threat to the safety of the building and the city. The combination of these factors ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles."
540	15373	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications."" The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles were significant, involving safety concerns, environmental factors, and legal restrictions that complicated the construction and utilization of a mooring mast on the iconic skyscraper."
541	15374	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Additionally, they had to figure out how to make dirigibles global, which led to meetings with the president of an airship transport company. The architects also had discussions with the government regarding safe ways to moor airships to the mast. Despite these efforts, the obstacles proved too great, and the plan to use dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately not implemented.
542	15375	6	3	"One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how to do it safely. According to the reading, it says that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" located at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe. Last but not least, another reason why dirigibles could not dock was because it was illegal. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Because of that law, it would make it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area. Therefore, it would be impossible for a ship to land there."
543	15376	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to consider the Hindenburg incident that took place on May 6, 1937, which made them realize the potential dangers of such a docking system above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Safety concerns for the people were paramount in their planning. Additionally, another obstacle they faced was the challenge of docking the dirigible while ensuring the safety of those on the ground. Unlike in open fields where weights could be used to hold down the back of the ship, doing so above a highly populated area was deemed unsafe due to the risk posed by lead weights dangling high above pedestrians. Nature itself was considered the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The builders had to navigate these challenges in designing the mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
544	15377	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The thousand-foot dirigible on top of the Empire State Building could add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible was way too much to carry, and the frame of the building would have to have been modified and strengthened to be able to hold the dirigible. There were many risks taken by landing a dirigible atop the Empire State Building. The additional weight and pressure could have compromised the structural integrity of the building, leading to potential safety hazards for both the dirigible and the building itself. Ultimately, the challenges and risks associated with allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building proved to be too significant, and the idea was never fully realized.
545	15378	6	3	The architects faced challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. To address the stress on the frame caused by tethered dirigibles, they designed a tower made of glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel, and a rocket-shaped mast with wings at its corners. Additionally, they needed to ensure the mooring mast's height was sufficient for safe docking. Discussions in Washington focused on finding a secure method for airships to dock at the mast. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered in creating a structure capable of accommodating dirigibles, showcasing their innovative problem-solving skills.
546	15379	6	3	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it. Additionally, the builders had to consider the safety risks involved in docking a dirigible on top of a skyscraper. Strong winds, turbulence, and other unpredictable weather conditions could pose a serious threat to the stability of the dirigible and the building structure. Moreover, the logistics of maneuvering a massive dirigible in a congested urban area like New York City would be extremely challenging and could potentially cause accidents or damage to surrounding buildings. In conclusion, while the idea of letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building may have seemed ambitious and futuristic, the practical challenges and existing laws ultimately made it unfeasible."
547	15380	6	3	"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the Hindenburg was destroyed, they realized that it would have been much worse over a highly populated city. Another problem was nature. Winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The third problem was that there was a law in place. As L¸sted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" the building would have to be much taller in order for the ships to even approach it. Another issue was the lack of appropriate landing space for the dirigibles, as the top of the Empire State Building was not designed to accommodate such large aircraft. Additionally, the structural integrity of the building would have been compromised by the weight and size of the dirigibles, posing a significant risk to both the occupants of the building and the surrounding area. Despite the potential benefits of having a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building, these obstacles ultimately proved too difficult to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the project."
548	15381	6	3	Building a big piece of work is not easy. You have to fix the negatives and do everything correctly. You never know at times you have to tear things down for hard work to be completed right. When looking at you did right things to prevent bad things from occurring. You may face a whole bunch of things when building. The Empire faced attemps one allowed to dock when building the dirigibles to the dock was not performed or built right. Even though said, swinging to climb on as build pressure by. Although, Building things is hard. You get the beauty and hardship out of it. It helps you reminded of your wells done correctly. Building requires attention to detail and precision to ensure that everything is done correctly. It is a challenging process that involves both beauty and hardship. Through hard work and dedication, one can achieve great results in construction projects.
549	15382	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting the dirigibles to dock there. Some of the most apparant reasons were because of what the dirigibles were made out of, weather conditions, and existing laws about airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not made out of the safest materials, most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flamible. This would make the docking Station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire. If the dirigible were to ever get caught on fire, the accident would be very severe, since the Station would be over a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the violent air currents atop the empire state building, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe to dock there. If something happened to the dirigible, it would be unsafe for the many pedestrians below it. The last reason for the docking station not being built is in paragraph @NUM2 because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It would be illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station because of this law. This law is because of the high winds, fearing that they would blow the dirigible onto other buildings. The docking station was unable to be built because of safety reasons and existing laws. Additionally, the materials used in dirigibles were not suitable for safe docking, and the unpredictable weather conditions at the top of the empire state building made it even more hazardous. Furthermore, the existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas added another barrier to the construction of the docking station. These challenges combined to prevent the realization of the dirigible docking station at the empire state building."
550	15383	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a dilemma as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest problems they encountered were related to safety and mooring the dirigible. The hydrogen used in dirigibles was highly flammable, posing a significant risk in a densely populated area like New York City. Additionally, anchoring the dirigible with heavy lead weights could potentially harm pedestrians below. Tethering the dirigible to the mast on top of the building would also cause it to swing in the wind, presenting further challenges. Ultimately, the builders were unable to overcome these obstacles, and the Empire State Building now serves primarily as an observation deck.
551	15384	6	3	"Docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is a feat that will most likely never be accomplished. The main concern with allowing this is safety. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects realized the accident would have been even more catastrophic, had it taken place over a city like New York. Nature also played a role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work, was that a law was passed; a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area. This meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast. These architects had very little working for them and almost everything working against them. Ultimately, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is not feasible due to safety concerns, unpredictable air currents, practical limitations, and legal restrictions."
552	15385	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a challenging task in constructing the tallest building in the world. When Al Smith pushed for the building to be made even taller to accommodate dirigibles, the difficulty of the project increased significantly. The architects needed to modify the structure to withstand the additional stress of a thousand-foot dirigible moored to the building. Furthermore, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles posed a serious fire hazard, with the potential for catastrophic consequences in downtown New York. Natural elements such as strong winds at the building's height added another layer of complexity, making it difficult for dirigibles to remain stable while docked. Additionally, regulations prohibiting airships from flying too low in urban areas presented a legal obstacle to the plan. Ultimately, despite their efforts, the project to use the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles proved unsuccessful.
553	15386	6	3	They have encountered numerous issues with individuals expressing concerns about the use of Airship on various platforms. These concerns often lack specific details and fail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation. It is crucial for people to supplement their arguments with appropriate information to address these issues effectively. By incorporating relevant details and insights, individuals can facilitate a more productive discussion and reach a mutually beneficial resolution. It is essential to foster constructive dialogue and enhance communication to mitigate misunderstandings and promote positive outcomes in discussions related to Airship.
554	15387	6	3	Al Smith and the engineers faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle that they faced was the fact that most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable chemical. This posed a significant risk of causing a fire and potentially destroying the building, putting millions of lives in danger. Additionally, the extreme winds at a height of 1,250 feet could easily blow a dirigible off course and into the building, resulting in a catastrophic accident. Furthermore, there were legal restrictions in place that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to proceed with the plan. Ultimately, despite their efforts to overcome these obstacles, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building would pose too great a risk to safety and the law to be feasible.
555	15388	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in incorporating a mooring mast for dirigibles, another obstacle arose due to the presence of a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This restriction further complicated the feasibility of implementing a docking system for dirigibles on top of the iconic skyscraper. The combination of structural concerns, wind conditions, and legal limitations presented significant barriers to the successful installation of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Despite the innovative design and efforts to strengthen the building's frame, the vision of a dirigible docking station atop the skyscraper ultimately proved unattainable due to these various obstacles.
556	15389	6	3	There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One problem is that if they were to tie a single cable tether to the building and the blimp, then it would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the blimp's load and wind pressure had to be sent all the way to the base of the building, which was 1,050 feet below. Another problem that arose later was that other blimps outside the United States were made with hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Now, since the German blimp, the Hindenburg, blew up by fire over Lakehurst, New Jersey, architects are now worried that it would be a bad idea to allow this because if it happened over New York City, then many more lives would be in danger.  Additionally, another obstacle was the changing winds at the top of the building due to violent wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear end of the blimp would be unstable. This is why blimps now dock on the ground and are held down by weights on all sides. Another reason docking a blimp at the Empire State Building would be illegal is that it is flying too low to the ground. This law also prohibits the blimp from docking onto the building.   In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there included structural stress, flammable hydrogen in foreign blimps, changing wind currents, and legal restrictions on docking heights. These challenges have led to alternative methods for docking blimps, ensuring safety and compliance with regulations.
557	15390	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders had to take. One obstacle was the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. they had to pay over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications into the building's framework. The modifications were necessary to ensure the safety and structural integrity of the Empire State building, allowing it to withstand the additional stress and pressure that would be imposed by the presence of the dirigible. Despite the challenges faced, the builders were able to successfully overcome these obstacles and complete the necessary modifications, ultimately paving the way for the successful operation of the dirigible mast on top of the iconic skyscraper.
558	15391	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in establishing a docking system for dirigibles. They had to design a secure way for the airships to attach to the building for refueling and passenger access. The attachment of the mooring mast had to be carefully planned to avoid adding excessive stress to the building's frame. The foundation had to be reinforced to support the additional weight and forces that would be exerted when a dirigible was docked. Moreover, the builders had to consider the unpredictable wind patterns at the top of the building, as any mishap could have serious consequences in the densely populated city below. Despite these obstacles, the builders successfully overcame the challenges and created a functional docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
559	15392	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in constructing the mooring mast were significant. The architects and engineers consulted with experts from the @PERSON1 air station, and even tested the mast using a dirigible. However, dropping a mooring mast onto the building would have caused stress to its frame. Ultimately, the mooring mast was deemed unsafe for use, as dirigibles often used flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a risk to the downtown area of New York. Consequently, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose.
560	15393	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, there were several other factors that contributed to the ultimate failure of the project. Despite spending over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the building's structure, the builders soon realized that the weather conditions, particularly high winds, posed a significant obstacle. The constant shifting of the dirigibles made it impossible to safely control their docking at the mooring mast. Furthermore, laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over populated cities presented another barrier to the project's success. Additionally, the highly flammable nature of dirigibles made them a dangerous choice for docking at such a height. In light of these challenges, it became evident that building a mooring mast for dirigibles was not a viable idea, and the project was ultimately abandoned.
561	15394	6	3	"The architects of late 1920s and 1930s New York had plans to revolutionize air travel, putting New York at the forefront of modern transportation. However, their ambitious ideas fell short of reality. In an attempt to surpass the Chrysler Building, architect Al Smith added an unsecured mast to the top of the Empire State Building, envisioning it as a docking station for blimps or dirigibles. This plan generated significant excitement, but the lack of thorough research posed a major safety concern. Most blimps outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen, making them a potential hazard in a densely populated area like New York City. The catastrophic explosion of the German blimp ""Hindenburg"" in New Jersey highlighted the dangers of using hydrogen as a lifting gas. Even if the mast had been successful, weather conditions would have posed a serious threat. The unpredictable winds could have made docking and refueling blimps a hazardous endeavor. Despite their grand vision, the architects of the 1920s and 1930s were ultimately unable to overcome the formidable challenges that stood in the way of their innovative plans for air travel in New York City."
562	15395	6	3	When the idea of creating a mooring post for dirigibles on top of the empire state building, there were several problems engineers failed to recognize. The first issue was the use of highly flammable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of such a choice, highlighting the dangers of an explosion, which would be amplified if it occurred over 100 stories in the air. Secondly, the presence of violent wind gusts would have made it impossible to safely dock the dirigible atop the building, particularly considering that using customary lead weights for stability would not only be risky but also impractical. Lastly, there was a preexisting law prohibiting the operation of any airship at such a low altitude in an urban area, further complicating the feasibility of the project. In conclusion, the idea of mooring dirigibles on top of the empire state building faced insurmountable challenges due to the use of hydrogen, wind gusts, and legal restrictions, highlighting the impracticality and safety concerns associated with such a venture.
563	15396	6	3	Based on the excerpt, it is evident that the architects of the Empire State Building were unaware of the potential issues with the mooring mast. The desire to outdo competitors and advance transportation blinded them to the risks involved. The idea of mooring a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building was quickly recognized as problematic, as it would add significant stress to the structure. Despite this realization, the mast was still added to the building, with concerns about potential disasters like the Hindenburg incident looming large. The unpredictable nature of high-altitude winds further highlighted the dangers of having a dirigible tethered to the mast. Ultimately, the mooring mast never served its intended purpose, and the shift from dirigibles to airplanes in the 1930s solidified its obsolescence. Today, the site of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is a popular tourist attraction, serving as a reminder of a failed vision for the future of transportation.
564	15397	6	3	The architects faced numerous obstacles when considering the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. One major challenge was the strain that a mooring mast would place on the building's frame, given its towering height of one thousand feet. Safety concerns also arose due to the use of highly flammable hydrogen gas in international dirigibles, potentially putting pedestrians at risk in the event of a fire or explosion. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents around the building would make docking and securing a dirigible difficult and dangerous. Finally, regulations prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of using the building as a docking station. Ultimately, these obstacles combined to thwart the plans for utilizing the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles.
565	15398	6	3	"There would have been many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building would have had to face if they decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners realized how much worse it would have been in a place such as New York City. Another big obstacle would have been nature itself. ""The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around, making it hard for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead weight, then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging over the pedestrians of New York City. The final obstacle that builders of the Empire State Building would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. They would not even be allowed to approach the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the challenges of flammable gases, unpredictable winds, and existing laws would have made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the iconic building."
566	15399	6	3	"The Empire State building is one of the tallest buildings ever built. It way because of this, that it was impossible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. The article by @ORGANIZATION1 titled ""The Mooring Mast"" describes well the problem blimps may have encountered. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" It's true, should a blimp try to moor there it would do nothing but twirl around the mooring mast. It could also crash into other buildings. It could tear up the mooring mast. There was so much the builders didn't look into. The design flaw in the mooring mast made it impossible for blimps to safely dock at the Empire State building, highlighting the importance of considering all factors when constructing such monumental structures."
567	15400	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top. Safety concerns arose due to the flammability of hydrogen used in most dirigibles. Additionally, unpredictable wind currents at the building's height posed a challenge for docking. However, the most significant obstacle was the illegality of docking aircraft at such a height, posing a danger to urban areas below. These obstacles ultimately led to the failure of the mooring mast project.
568	15401	6	3	The builders also had to consider the safety of the Dirigible and the people on board. The heavy winds on top of the building were shifting due to the violent air currents, making it difficult for the Dirigible to land safely. The Dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast, adding to the challenge of landing. Moreover, flying too low over urban areas was not allowed by law, presenting another obstacle for the builders to navigate. Despite these challenges, the builders were determined to find a solution that would allow the Dirigible to safely dock at the Empire State Building.
569	15402	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were to build a structure with a stable enough top to be able to hold a dirigible. Once the Chrysler Building became taller than the Empire State Building, however, the idea of dirigibles slowly faded away, unnoticed. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith said he would put a top or hat on the building to make it taller. The only problem is that instead of dirigibles docking there, they would just sit next to the point of the building. If Smith wasn't so competitive, the blimps would have a nice platform to dock on. However, as the competition for the tallest building grew, practicality took precedence over luxury, and the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building eventually dissipated.
570	15403	6	3	In constructing and building the Empire State Building to accommodate dirigibles for docking, the builders faced numerous challenges that required careful consideration. They needed to assess the structural integrity of the building to ensure it could support the added weight and stress of the airships. Additionally, they had to prioritize the safety of both passengers and pedestrians, devising efficient and secure methods for ingress and egress. Despite the meticulous planning and effort invested in realizing Al Smith's vision, the feasibility of the proposal ultimately did not align with public perception, leading to its abandonment. Nevertheless, the endeavor serves as a valuable lesson for future constructors, highlighting the importance of thorough planning and realistic expectations in ambitious architectural projects.
571	15404	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first problems they faced was not being able to land due to the lack of a suitable landing area. Another problem was the safety issue caused by dirigibles using hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building made landing difficult and unsafe. These challenges hindered the builders' efforts to modernize dirigible travel in New York City.
572	15405	6	3	The obstacles that builders faced at the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include the possible dangers of having something fall on them. The hydrogen used in dirigibles is highly flammable, posing a risk of explosions that could endanger anyone in the vicinity. Additionally, the structural integrity of the Empire State Building may not be strong enough to withstand the movement of the dirigible, especially in strong winds. This could potentially result in parts of the building being damaged or dislodged, posing a threat to nearby pedestrians. Therefore, the challenges of incorporating a dirigible docking system at the Empire State Building are significant and require careful consideration to ensure the safety of all involved.
573	15406	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were significant. When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest building, aiming to surpass the new Chrysler Building under construction at forty-second Street and @CAPS1 Avenue in New York. Al Smith was determined to outstrip the competition by incorporating a mooring mast at the Empire State Building's top for dirigibles or zeppelins to dock. However, the challenges of high winds and turbulence at such heights made docking extremely hazardous. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building was completed without a functional docking station for airships. The ambition to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building's mast remained unrealized.
574	15407	6	3	Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of the wind on top of the Empire State Building posed a significant challenge for dirigibles attempting to dock. The shifting wind patterns, caused by violent air currents in the area, would make it difficult for a dirigible to remain stable while moored to the building. The constant swiveling of the ship around the mooring mast could lead to potential damage to both the dirigible and the building's structure. Despite the numerous obstacles faced by the builders, they were determined to find a solution that would allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
575	15408	6	3	Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One significant issue was the excessive stress placed on the building's framework when a dirigible was attached by a single cable. This stress resulted from the combined weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure at the top of the towering structure. To address this, the builders had to make over $60,000 worth of modifications to the building's frame. Another obstacle was the safety concerns associated with docking a dirigible. Many dirigibles outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen gas instead of the safer helium. This raised fears about the potential for a catastrophic accident, such as the infamous Hindenburg disaster, occurring over a densely populated urban area. Additionally, the high wind speeds at the Empire State Building's height posed a challenge. Even when securely docked, a dirigible would sway violently in the strong winds at over 1,400 feet. Moreover, the usual practice of weighting down a dirigible with lead weights was not feasible in this urban setting, as it posed a risk to pedestrians below. Ultimately, these safety concerns, combined with existing laws restricting airship heights in urban areas, made docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building impractical and unsafe. The builders faced a multitude of challenges in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles, highlighting the complexity of integrating air travel with urban structures.
576	15409	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @PERSON1, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. They needed a suitable landing area, which was a Mooring Mast. But before building the mast, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Workers framed to the building all the way up to the 85th floor. Before the framing for the mast could take place, the roof had to be completed. The architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disastrous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" set a good example on why they couldn't do it. The area around the building was too densely populated. The dirigible had a strong chance of resulting in a disaster over New York City, considering the violent air currents. The project was simply too risky, but was a great idea involving future transportation. The architects had to abandon the project due to the potential risks involved, prioritizing the safety of the city and its inhabitants over the innovative concept of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
577	15410	6	3	In addition, the structure of the Empire State Building itself posed a challenge for dirigibles. The building's height and design made it difficult for airships to safely approach and dock. The builders had to come up with innovative solutions to address these issues and ensure the safety of both the dirigibles and the building. Despite these obstacles, the builders were determined to make the Empire State Building a hub for airship travel. Ultimately, their efforts paid off, and the Empire State Building became a symbol of modern engineering and innovation.
578	15411	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered major obstacles. The first puzzle posed to the builders concerned the structure. They realized that ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted... to the building's foundation."" This reality caused builders to spend over $1 million modifying the building. Although the builders were able to rectify the framework of the building, the later obstacles were unable to be conquered. After the Hindenburg accident in 1937 ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been"" if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city became a concern. Until the blimps were less flammable, it wasn't plausible to take the risk of housing them in densely populated areas. The final obstacle of the success of the mooring mast was ""nature itself."" The violent winds that whipped around the 101st and 102nd floors would spin the dirigibles around the mooring mast. This was ""neither practical or safe."" Overall, the obstacles the builders faced proved to be fatal to the success of the mooring mast. The challenges of structural modification, safety concerns, and natural wind forces ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building."
579	15412	6	3	The architects had to modify the building's frames to strengthen them before they could consider dropping a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. This was necessary to prevent adding stress to the building's structure. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable, posed a significant risk to the population of New York City. The unpredictable nature of the winds also presented a challenge, as the swiveling of the dirigible around the mooring mast could endanger pedestrians below. Furthermore, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas prohibited dirigibles from mooring at the building. These factors combined to make it impractical for dirigibles to use the Empire State Building as a mooring point.
580	15413	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced huge obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as the winds atop the building were always changing due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered, it would swivel around, making it impractical and unsafe to dock atop the building. Additionally, the dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, further increasing the risk and danger involved in the docking process. Overall, the obstacles faced by the builders in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were significant and ultimately made it an unfeasible and hazardous endeavor."
581	15414	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the added stress on the building's frame from a mooring mast attached by a single cable to a dirigible. Another obstacle was reinforcing the building's structure to withstand the mast. These challenges required careful planning and engineering to ensure the safety and stability of the building while accommodating dirigibles. Despite the difficulties, the builders were able to overcome these obstacles and successfully incorporate a mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
582	15415	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, a four-term governor of New York, envisioned the top of the Building as a ""higher Calling"" equipped for an age of transportation that was then only a dream. However, obstacles arose, starting with the lack of suitable space in New York City. Clearing about four blocks in the bustling city was necessary. The architects and engineers consulted experts, but over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were needed for the building's framework. Ultimately, the building was expanded to 102 floors, including a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself."
583	15416	6	3	A @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building in 1929 faced numerous challenges. The building was not originally designed to support the weight and stress of a thousand-foot dirigible, leading to structural concerns. To address this, Governor Al Smith invested in strengthening the building's support, but safety remained a significant issue. The flammability of hydrogen, a key component of dirigibles, raised fears of potential disasters similar to the Hindenburg tragedy. Additionally, uncontrollable air currents at such heights made it unsafe for a dirigible to be tethered to the building. Ultimately, the idea proved impractical and the mooring mast on the Empire State Building's 102nd floor was rendered unusable, highlighting the inherent risks and challenges of such a proposal.
584	15417	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan."" ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful."
585	15418	6	3	There were many obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. One of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety. Most of the foreign dirigibles ran on hydrogen and the builders did not want to risk another Hindenburg accident in the highly populated New York City. Nature also restricted the building of a dock. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, another threat that the builders did not want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. There were many reasons why the mast was never constructed including safety issues, nature, and an existing law that prohibited low air travel over the city. In the end however, the building of a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe, and the project was eventually dropped.
586	15419	6	3	Mooring dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building would not be feasible due to several reasons. Firstly, the majority of dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk in a densely populated area like New York City. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building would make docking a dirigible challenging, as the winds could cause the dirigible to swing out of control and potentially collide with nearby buildings. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the combination of safety concerns, climate obstacles, and legal restrictions make mooring dirigibles on the Empire State Building unfeasible.
587	15420	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in installing a mooring mast were significant. The frame of the building could not simply accommodate the addition of a mooring mast without extensive modifications. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. This required the steel frame to be modified and strengthened at a cost of over sixty thousand dollars. The architects designed a sleek tower made of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, illuminated from the sides. The tower featured a steps-back design mirroring the overall shape of the building, with a capital rocket-shaped mast adorned with shiny aluminum wings at its corners. Rising to a conical roof housing the mooring arm, the tower was a striking addition to the Empire State Building.
588	15421	6	3	The greatest reason for the Empire State Building's mooring mast not being able to fulfill its purpose was safety. The highly flammable hydrogen used in dirigibles posed a significant risk in a densely populated area. Additionally, the constantly shifting winds on the top of the building created dangerous air currents that made docking a dirigible a perilous endeavor. The potential for the dirigible to sway back and forth due to the wind presented a clear danger to pedestrians below. Ultimately, these safety concerns and practical limitations prevented the mooring mast from ever being used for its intended purpose.
589	15422	6	3	"The problems the builders faced in attempting to construct the Empire State Building were multifaceted. Initially, the issue of tethering a dirigible to the mast posed structural concerns, as the single cable tether would place undue stress on the building's frame. To accommodate the wind pressure and weight of the dirigible, the foundation had to be reinforced and the frame redesigned. Furthermore, the oversight of not installing mooring equipment for the delivery of newspapers by ""Columbia"" highlighted the lack of foresight in the building's design and implementation. These challenges underscored the importance of considering practicality and feasibility in the construction of such monumental structures."
590	15423	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. One major challenge was safety concerns regarding the construction of a mooring mast for blimps on the building's top. Since most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, the risk of explosion was a significant threat to public safety in New York City. Additionally, the added stress of a single cable tether for the blimps would have put strain on the building's frame, necessitating modifications to strengthen the steel structure. These obstacles required careful consideration and adjustments to ensure the safety and structural integrity of the Empire State Building.
591	15424	6	3	"The @CAPS1 who made the Mooring mast faced many obstacles when trying to get dirigibles to dock. Some were safety, nature itself, and pre-existing laws. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The greatest obstacle was nature. Winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash into the mast. An existing law prevented airships from flying too low in urban cities. For all the work the @CAPS1 put into the mast, it could never live up to its potential due to these challenges."
592	15425	6	3	The Empire State building was not a good place to attach a blimp to. One reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues. In every country except the United States, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans. Even after millions of dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished. Additionally, the structural integrity of the Empire State Building may not have been able to support the weight and stress of a mooring mast and a tethered blimp. This could have posed a significant risk to the building and its occupants. Overall, the challenges and safety concerns associated with attaching a blimp to the Empire State Building made it an impractical and ultimately unfeasible idea.
593	15426	6	3	The challenge that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they couldn't attach a top part to the building all at once. They had to carefully add each piece, as putting too much weight on the structure at once could cause it to become stressed to the point of potential collapse. This meticulous process was necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of the iconic skyscraper.
594	15427	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One major challenge was the need to securely attach the mast to the building's foundation to prevent added stress on the frame. Additionally, the highly flammable nature of hydrogen in dirigibles, as highlighted by the Hindenburg disaster, posed a significant safety concern for both passengers and people on the ground in the event of an explosion. Moreover, the strong winds at the top of the building presented a formidable obstacle, as they could potentially cause the dirigible to sway dangerously around the mast. These factors combined to ultimately prevent any dirigibles from landing on the Empire State Building's mast, highlighting the complex challenges faced by the builders in realizing this ambitious vision.
595	15428	6	3	"When building a great task, many obstacles need to be faced. For the builders of the Empire State Building it was ones concerning the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. One was safety. The builders had to make sure it was safe to dock on and off the blimp, and it was safe to fly. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" People wouldn't be safe on a blimp that could explode at any moment. Another obstacle the builders had to face was building the mooring mast itself for docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The blimp wouldn't be able to hold correctly to the mast and it would move around too much. It wasn't safe or practical for anyone. These are some obstacles many builders have to face, but the ones of the Empire State Building overcame them well. The engineers and architects worked diligently to create a safe and stable mooring mast, ensuring that the dirigibles could dock securely without the risk of accidents. Their innovative solutions and meticulous planning ultimately led to the successful integration of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building, solidifying its status as an iconic landmark in New York City."
596	15429	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in their design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it was illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building. Additionally, the weight and size of the dirigible would have posed a significant challenge in terms of maneuvering it into position safely. Moreover, the logistics of docking and undocking a dirigible at such a height in the midst of New York City's busy airspace would have been immensely complicated. In conclusion, the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed unfeasible due to a combination of safety concerns, legal restrictions, and practical challenges.
597	15430	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that hindered the docking of dirigibles. These large balloons, used for passenger transportation, required a substantial landing area, necessitating the design of a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would exert significant stress on the building's frame, leading to extensive modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, safety concerns arose due to the flammability of dirigibles using hydrogen, as exemplified by the tragic incident involving the German blimp ""Hindenburg."" The potential risk to the densely populated area around the Empire State Building in New York made docking dirigibles a hazardous endeavor. Furthermore, laws prohibited flying dirigibles too low over the city, further complicating their use for transportation. Nature presented another challenge, as forceful winds during docking could cause the back of the ship to swivel and potentially collide with the building's sharp spires. Additionally, the use of lead weights for stabilization posed a threat to pedestrians below. These obstacles made it difficult to develop docking gear that could safely accommodate dirigibles."
598	15431	6	3	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 highlights the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as they aimed to create the world's tallest building. In competition with the Chrysler Building, Al Smith ambitiously announced a height of 1,250 feet, surpassing the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Despite their high hopes, @ORGANIZATION2's plan to create a docking spot for dirigibles did not go as intended. Instead, the designated area for dirigible passengers was transformed into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden. This unexpected turn of events showcases the unpredictable nature of large-scale construction projects and the creativity required to adapt to changing circumstances.
599	15432	6	3	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 explores the challenges faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Governor Al Smith, the mastermind behind the building's construction, aimed to make it the tallest in the world by adding a distinctive top with a mooring mast for dirigibles. However, architects soon realized that the stress of a dirigible's load on the building's frame would be too great, leading to safety concerns. Despite efforts to make the idea work, it was eventually deemed impractical and abandoned by the late 1930s. Nevertheless, the Empire State Building remains a popular tourist attraction, offering visitors the chance to experience its observation decks.
600	15433	6	3	During the times of the Empire State Building and its claim to fame with height, its architect, Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of its construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped set the record for the highest building. Ultimately, the challenges faced with the mooring mast highlighted the complexities of integrating airships with urban structures during that era.
601	15434	6	3	One obstacle the builders had to face was the amount of wind that was blowing that high in the air. The dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway from the back. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. Being filled up with such a flammable gas it could easily turn into a disaster, especially with all the people who were so close to it on the ground. Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigibles posed a challenge in terms of maneuverability and docking. Maneuvering such massive airships required skill and precision to avoid collisions and accidents. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully constructed the dirigibles, revolutionizing air travel in the process.
602	15435	6	3	During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, builders faced several obstacles. One challenge was the need to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame to support the mast. Additionally, the risk of accidents, such as the Hindenburg disaster, posed a significant danger due to the potential harm to nearby individuals. The unpredictable wind currents above the building, influenced by violent air currents, also presented a major obstacle. Moreover, the impracticality and safety concerns of dirigibles having weights dangling above pedestrians further complicated the use of the mooring mast. Lastly, the difficulty in maneuvering blimps close to the mast, as seen with the Los Angeles, added to the list of challenges. As a result of these obstacles, the mooring mast has not been utilized since its construction.
603	15436	6	3	The empire state building's construction workers attempted to build a dirigible dock on top of the world's tallest building but many problems occurred during the process. In order to have a dirigible dock on the top of the building, the building would have to withstand its weight. The steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The 102-story building was predicted to be a success and become the new age of aviation travel. However, another obstacle that the workers faced was realizing that dirigibles outside the US were highly flammable because they contain hydrogen. It would be disastrous if one caught on fire on top of the building in New York City. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. There are very strong and violent winds at the top of the building, and the blimp could become a hazard if it were blown out of control. A blimp hovering over hundreds of pedestrians in the city of New York is a definite hazard. Additionally, there is a law forbidding aircraft from flying too low over populated areas. Having a mooring dock was a good idea in theory, but it was never really practical or safe, as many dangerous scenarios could have unfolded if it had been operational.
604	15437	6	3	The builders had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One main challenge was the stress a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add to the frame. This meant that the mooring mast couldn't be placed on top until major adjustments were made to support the added weight. Additionally, the builders had to design and construct a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would complement the building's overall shape. This tower needed to be illuminated from inside, creating a stunning visual effect. The mast, with a steel skeleton and clad in stainless steel with glass windows, had to be carefully built and installed. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered, ultimately creating a masterpiece that allowed dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building.
605	15438	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature, and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was also an existing law against these airships. Docking the dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen which was highly flammable, there was one incident on May 6, 1937 where the German dirigibles caught on fire. This was known as the Hindenburg's accident. Builders knew this can risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would dock violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. The law against airships were they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas. The challenges faced in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were significant and multifaceted, encompassing structural concerns, safety risks, and legal restrictions that ultimately posed insurmountable obstacles to this ambitious endeavor.
606	15439	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the @CAPS1 wanted to ensure that it remained the tallest building in New York. They made modifications to the design to prevent it from being surpassed by the Chrysler Building. Originally, the Empire State Building was not intended to have a mooring mast. However, after the structure had to be reframed, the government imposed restrictions on aircraft flying too low, leading to the decline of the airship industry. Commercial airliners soon took over, making it impractical for dirigibles to dock at the building. The strong currents around the Empire State Building posed a significant danger, as they could easily blow a dirigible off course, potentially causing accidents similar to the infamous Hindenburg disaster.
607	15440	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced various obstacles while constructing a dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. One challenge was the height of the building, requiring additional framework, materials, and safety precautions. Another obstacle was the safety concerns, as the densely populated area of downtown New York posed risks in the event of an accident. Additionally, nature presented a significant obstacle, with unpredictable winds affecting the stability of the dirigible. These challenges demonstrate the complexity involved in building the iconic mooring mast atop the Empire State Building.
608	15441	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, one of the main obstacles faced was the desire to have Dirigibles be able to land and board on the building. This presented a challenge due to the limited space available in New York City for such a purpose. However, after much consideration and planning, the decision was made to include a mooring mast for Dirigibles on the building. Despite the initial concerns, the use of Dirigibles for the mooring mast proved to be successful. This innovative solution not only added to the functionality of the Empire State Building but also showcased the ingenuity and forward-thinking mindset of those involved in its construction. Ultimately, the successful integration of Dirigibles into the building's design was a testament to the determination and creativity of the individuals behind this iconic structure.
609	15442	6	3	"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was one of the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety."
610	15443	6	3	Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasn't. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With a 1000 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Additionally, the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents pose a significant challenge. The dirigible would also be dangling above pedestrians on the street, posing a safety risk. Moreover, it is illegal for airships to fly low over urban areas, making it impossible for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. While the idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building may seem appealing, the numerous obstacles make it unrealistic and unfeasible.
611	15444	6	3	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of question.  Another concern that the builders faced was the lack of suitable space for dirigibles to maneuver safely around the building. With the structure being surrounded by other tall buildings and busy streets, the risk of a collision was high. Additionally, the limited experience and expertise in dirigible docking procedures posed a challenge, as there were no established protocols for such operations.  Despite these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building showcased the ambition and innovation of the time. While ultimately deemed unfeasible due to safety concerns and legal restrictions, the concept highlighted the desire to push the boundaries of technological advancements in aviation."
612	15445	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper. Safety was the foremost concern, particularly due to the highly flammable nature of the hydrogen used in the blimps. An accident involving a dirigible could have had devastating consequences in the densely populated downtown area surrounding the building. Additionally, the unpredictable winds at the top of the building, caused by violent air currents, posed a significant challenge for the safe docking of dirigibles. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the efforts to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Despite these obstacles, the builders worked tirelessly to find solutions and ensure the safety of all involved.
613	15446	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of Hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the United States. This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. When the german dirigible was destroyed in New Jersey the architects of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous it was. Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles At the Empire State Building was because of the law against airships. The law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. These are a Few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which prevented the use of the mooring mast. The challenges posed by the use of hydrogen, unpredictable weather conditions, and legal restrictions against airships ultimately hindered the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
614	15447	6	3	"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building was a great idea. However in reality, it didn't turn out so well. There are many reasons why a dirgible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example, ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (paragraph @NUM2) Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building, coupled with the presence of other skyscrapers in close proximity, would make it extremely difficult for a dirigible to safely approach and dock. The risk of collision with other buildings or structures would pose a significant threat to the safety of both the dirigible and the people on the ground below. In conclusion, while the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building may have seemed innovative, the practical limitations and safety concerns make it clear why this concept was ultimately unsuccessful."
615	15448	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. The building of the mast was rushed by Al Smith to maintain the title of the world's tallest building. However, many obstacles quickly arose. The lack of a suitable landing area was a major issue, with Smith suggesting passengers could swing in the breeze. As construction continued, it became apparent that nature posed a significant challenge, with strong winds at the building's height making landing difficult. Engineers and architects struggled to find a solution until a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas was discovered. This law marked the end of Smith's idea, and by the late 1930s, the concept of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quietly disappeared.
616	15449	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges when attempting to accommodate dirigibles for docking. One obstacle was its size, as it was in direct competition with the Chrysler Building. The mooring mast at the Empire State Building was criticized for not being able to fulfill its intended purpose. Another hurdle was the lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles in New York City, prompting the addition of a mooring mast. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building persevered through trials and tribulations to become a monumental structure in the city.
617	15450	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. One obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building. It needed to be changed entirely to accommodate landing dirigibles: ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the renovations for the redesigned, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the level of safety. Thousands of lives could have been lost if a dirigible accident occurred in New York City: ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@NUM2). The biggest obstacle by far was the elements. Dirigibles were easily swayed in times of bad weather: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was very unsafe because of the dense population of people in New York City. If a dirigible swiveled around the mooring mast too much, it could hit another building or crash. The people behind the construction of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties, therefore the mooring mast was never used. Despite the challenges and risks involved, the decision not to use the mooring mast ultimately prioritized the safety of the city and its inhabitants."
618	15451	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the building's framework to withstand wind pressure and stress from dirigibles. This required innovative structural design and materials to ensure the building's stability. The next challenge was dealing with strong wind currents at the building's height, which posed a risk for dirigibles attempting to dock at the mooring mast. The architects had to consider the building's aerodynamics and the impact of wind on airship operations. Additionally, a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas presented a hurdle for the building team. They had to navigate regulatory restrictions while accommodating the needs of potential dirigible docking. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building was successfully completed, standing as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of challenges.
619	15452	6	3	In the excerpt, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. They did not anticipate the potential risks associated with the dirigibles, such as the possibility of a fire similar to the Hindenburg disaster. Additionally, the height of the building posed challenges due to the strong wind currents at such elevations. Despite their efforts to overcome these obstacles, the builders encountered numerous difficulties throughout the construction process.
620	15453	6	3	The obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. One of the obstacles to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also, the Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state building's flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle as to why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Ultimately, the challenges faced in creating a docking area for dirigibles at the Empire State Building proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious project.
621	15454	6	3	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of their problems included the structure of the building, wind and weather conditions, and the safety of passengers. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a stainless steel skeleton. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and would need lead weights to hold it down, which was considered unsafe. Finally, the safety of the passengers was at stake because the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Additionally, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building due to the many obstacles they faced.
622	15455	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. One major impediment was the laws regarding aircraft, which prohibited aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Another issue was the safety risks associated with docking dirigibles, as they were filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas. After the Hindenburg explosion, the builders realized the potential for catastrophic accidents. However, the biggest obstacle they faced was Mother Nature herself. The height of the Empire State Building caused high-speed winds that would have made it extremely dangerous to moor a dirigible, as the winds could easily fling the airship around like a rag doll. Considering all these risks, the builders ultimately decided to abandon the idea of docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building.
623	15456	6	3	The Empire State Building was designed to be the world's tallest building, with Governor Al Smith envisioning it as more than just ornamental. He aimed for the building to be equipped for the age of transportation, specifically as an attraction for dirigibles to dock. Despite facing obstacles during construction, Al Smith saw the mooring mast idea as a great opportunity and assured that it was being worked on. However, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building ultimately never fulfilled its intended purpose.
624	15457	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passengers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome. Despite their best efforts, the safety risks and structural concerns were insurmountable, ultimately leading to the realization that the concept of a mooring mast for dirigibles was not feasible in this particular setting."
625	15458	6	3	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers. Additionally, the structural integrity of the building was not designed to withstand the weight and impact of a dirigible docking, further complicating the feasibility of the project. The challenges faced by the engineers and constructors ultimately led to the abandonment of the original plan to allow for dirigible dockings on the Empire State Building. Despite the setbacks, the iconic building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and architectural achievement.
626	15459	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a major obstacle because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle faced in this attempt was nature itself. Nature was one of many major problems to allow a dirigible to dock. For example, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The winds would shift the ship and it would be very difficult to land on the mooring mast. The other practical problem builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The entire idea was eventually dropped by the late 1930s. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the creation of ""The Mooring Mast."""
627	15460	6	3	When constructing a mooring mast, @CAPS1 ran into many problems. Safety was the main concern they faced, particularly due to the flammability of the hydrogen-filled blimps. Following the tragic incident involving the Hindenburg blimp, people in @CAPS1 were understandably fearful of a similar disaster occurring near the Empire State Building. Additionally, legal restrictions posed a challenge, as flying airships low over urban areas was prohibited at the time. The unpredictable winds also hindered the successful docking of blimps, as some struggled to get close enough for mooring without being blown off course. This not only made it difficult for passengers to disembark but also raised concerns about potential collisions with nearby buildings. Despite the initial promise of the mooring mast concept, these various obstacles proved too significant to overcome, ultimately preventing its successful implementation.
628	15461	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the violent air currents at the top of the building, which could cause the back end of the dirigibles to thrash around uncontrollably in the wind. This posed a significant risk of the dirigibles crashing into other buildings or falling to the ground where pedestrians walked. Additionally, the highly flammable nature of dirigibles was a concern, especially after the tragic destruction of the German blimp, the Hindenburg. These challenges led the builders to reconsider their idea, as using lead weights to stabilize the dirigibles at the Empire State building would not be practical or safe. Ultimately, the risks and logistical difficulties involved in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building outweighed the potential benefits, and the idea was abandoned.
629	15462	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the empire state building faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, enormous steelframed balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium, were lighter than air. However, mooring a dirigible on top of the building would add stress to the frame, requiring the transmission of this stress to the building foundation nearly eleven hundred feet below. The potential hazards became apparent when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. The use of hydrogen in many dirigibles outside the United States was deemed highly flammable. This risk, along with the stress the dirigibles would place on the building, led to the decision not to install mooring masts on the empire state building. Despite this setback, the empire state building still became the world's tallest building.
630	15463	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State building were always shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Another obstacle builders faced was a law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ""ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Additionally, the height of the building posed a challenge as well, as dirigibles would have to navigate through the dense urban environment to reach the docking point. Despite these obstacles, the builders were determined to find a solution to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Ultimately, with careful planning and innovative engineering, they were able to overcome these challenges and make it possible for airships to dock on the iconic skyscraper."
631	15464	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in implementing a mooring mast for dirigibles. The initial obstacle was the transfer of stress from the airship to the building's foundation, followed by the need to strengthen the steel frame to support the mast. However, the use of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas in most dirigibles outside the U.S., posed a significant safety risk. Additionally, the unpredictable winds in New York made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mast safely. The potential hazard of dirigibles hovering above pedestrians further complicated the feasibility of using the mooring mast. Ultimately, due to these obstacles, the mooring mast at the Empire State Building was never utilized.
632	15465	6	3	The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
633	15466	6	3	Despite the significant investment and effort put into constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the owners ultimately realized that the idea of docking dirigibles there was too risky. The modifications made to the building's framework, the design of the shiny tower, and the construction of the mooring mast all proved to be futile. The Empire State Building would never serve as a docking station for dirigibles as originally envisioned.
634	15467	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete."
635	15468	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main obstacles was the lack of a good landing area. Dirigibles were pretty big and there wasn't a great spot for it. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City""- paragraph 6. Therefore, this caused problems for the builders to figure out where to put it. The sheer size of the dirigibles made finding a suitable landing area a challenging task."
636	15469	6	3	"The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted highlights the challenges faced by dirigibles attempting to dock at the mooring mast. The tragic accident involving the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in New Jersey raised concerns about the potential devastation if a similar incident occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Furthermore, the existing law prohibiting low-flying airships in urban areas posed a significant obstacle, making it illegal for ships to approach or tie up to the building. However, the most formidable challenge came from mother nature herself, as the unpredictable and violent air currents at high altitudes caused the ships to sway dangerously, posing a threat to both passengers and pedestrians below. These factors combined ultimately thwarted the realization of the project in New York, highlighting the complex interplay between human regulations and the forces of nature in the world of aviation."
637	15470	6	3	"In a competition with architect building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to construct a taller building with a purpose. That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then their were problems, in the beginning the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since."
638	15471	6	3	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that. The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns. The weather at the top of the building was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether. The combination of weather conditions, legal restrictions, and safety risks created insurmountable challenges for the builders, leading to the abandonment of the dream to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible terminal."
639	15472	6	3	To address these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building had to strengthen the structure to withstand the added stress of the dirigible mooring. They also worked with lawmakers to find a solution that would allow the airship to safely dock at the top of the building without violating any regulations. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building was successfully completed and became an iconic symbol of New York City.
640	15473	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Is because it would have added to much stress to the frame of the Empire State Building, which could have caused the collapse over a period of time. So the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accomade this new situation"", as said in the excerpt. After the builders completed framing the Empire State Building up to the eighty-fifth floor, it was now time to do the framing of the rooftop to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. After the workers completed the framing of the rooftop, they build the mooring mast on to it, now the builders faced the challenge of framing the mooring mass. The builders framed the mooring mast with a skeleton of steel. The builders faced these challenges in the attempt to allow derilibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building required careful planning and execution to ensure the safety and stability of the structure. By strengthening the frame of the building and carefully constructing the mooring mast, the builders were able to overcome these obstacles and create a unique docking space for dirigibles atop the iconic Empire State Building."
641	15474	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was the additional stress that mooring a dirigible would place on the building's frame, requiring expensive modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars. Subsequently, it was discovered that allowing dirigibles to dock was unsafe due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in most non-U.S. dirigibles. This posed a significant risk of accidents, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, occurring above the densely populated urban area of New York. Furthermore, the shifting winds on top of the building proved to be too violent for the dirigibles, causing them to swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast. These challenges, combined with existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, ultimately led to only one dirigible ever being moored at the Empire State Building.
642	15475	6	3	"Challenges can be faced when radical ideas are put into action. When faced with the task of docking dirigibles, or zeppelins, atop the Empire State Building, the builders ran into challenges that are natural to come along with new thoughts. One challenge included was the fact of the wind from such an altitude as the Empire State Building made situations perilous for blimps and people on the ground. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with the laws of the United States government. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These were some of the difficulties dealt with by builders in the construction of the Empire State Building's mast. Additionally, the sheer size and weight of dirigibles posed a challenge as the structure of the Empire State Building had to be reinforced to accommodate the docking process safely. Moreover, the lack of advanced technology and safety measures at the time added to the complexity of executing such a daring idea. In conclusion, the challenges faced by builders in docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building highlight the intricate nature of bringing radical ideas to life and the importance of overcoming obstacles to achieve innovation."
643	15476	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant challenge was the danger posed by dirigibles, especially those using hydrogen instead of helium, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Additionally, the forceful winds at the building's height would have made docking difficult, causing the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast even if tethered. Moreover, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or any produced area. Ultimately, these obstacles rendered it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
644	15477	6	3	"The builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed. New York has many people that walk everywhere. The builders also needed to consider the violent winds at such a high altitude. These winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel. The winds are constantly shifting. They could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". I think that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast. The lack of consideration for safety and the potential risks ultimately led to the downfall of the mooring mast project."
645	15478	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. However, the builders faced significant obstacles that led to the abandonment of this idea. One major concern was the use of hydrogen in foreign dirigibles, which posed a high risk of explosion due to its flammability. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent winds at the top of the building would have made it challenging for dirigibles to safely dock and remain stable. Ultimately, these obstacles forced the builders to shelve the plan of utilizing the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles."
646	15479	6	3	In the story, construction workers faced a problem with the idea of having a dirigible's dock on top of the Empire State Building. The architects had not considered the legal measures regarding aircraft flying low over urban areas, the challenges posed by heavy winds around the building, and the potential dangers to civilians. If not executed correctly, the aircraft could break loose and descend into urban areas or, like the German dirigible, catch on fire and explode. Despite having a working prototype, the project was discontinued, giving airplanes the advantage as a safer mode of air travel.
647	15480	6	3	There's more than one obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor on the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These challenges made it impossible for blimps to safely dock at the iconic skyscraper, ultimately leading to the decision to abandon the idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for airships.
648	15481	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The violent winds and changing climate made it extremely difficult to tie down the blimps to the mooring mast. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from mooring on the building. Safety concerns also played a significant role, as dirigibles outside of the United States used flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a potential risk if a fire were to break out over a busy city like New York. These challenges ultimately led to the decision that dirigibles would never be able to be tied down to the Empire State Building's mooring mast.
649	15482	6	3	In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe. And it wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway. Additionally, the weather conditions in New York City posed a significant challenge for dirigibles, with strong winds and unpredictable weather patterns making it difficult for airships to safely navigate the city skyline. Despite these obstacles, the architects were determined to make the mooring mast a reality, showcasing the innovative spirit of the time. Ultimately, the mooring mast was never used for its intended purpose, but it remains a testament to the ambitious vision of those who sought to push the boundaries of engineering and design.
650	15483	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. They wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building for dirigibles to anchor for refueling or service. However, they discovered that a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. Additionally, the narrow top of the building made it difficult to accommodate dirigibles. As a result, Al Smith's vision of allowing dirigibles to land on the building was not realized.
651	15484	6	3	"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin. The risks and complications surrounding the mooring mast project ultimately highlighted the importance of thorough planning and consideration before embarking on ambitious ventures."
652	15485	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 there are many reasons that a proper, working Mast was impossible. There were natural reasons and mechanical reasons, as well as time and safety concerns. Nature played a key role in this project; the winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" due to its location. When two blimps attempted to dock for testing, one was too unstable, and the other threw paper down a rope. After this incident, the idea of the mooring mast was shelved. @CAPS1 replaced the blimps over time as they were flammable and dangerous. Additionally, flying at such a height was illegal. The challenges faced by the mooring mast project were a combination of natural elements, mechanical issues, and safety risks, ultimately leading to its abandonment."
653	15486	6	3	The complications in docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building were significant. Legal restrictions prevented them from flying too low above the city, due to the risk of accidents. Additionally, the strong air currents around the tall buildings, particularly at the height of the Empire State Building, posed a serious threat to the safety of the dirigibles. Even if tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds could cause the airship to crash into the building and potentially fall to the streets below. The tragic explosion of the Hindenburg dirigible in 1937 further heightened concerns about the use of flammable hydrogen gas in these airships. The combination of these factors made it clear that landing dirigibles at the Empire State Building was too risky, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the mooring mast project.
654	15487	6	3	Some obstacles were that there were many sharp rods on surrounding buildings, so if the dirigible touched one, it could pop. Additionally, if the wind was blowing, it was difficult and unsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building. These challenges made navigating and docking dirigibles a risky and precarious task.
655	15488	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face. One obstacle being constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand foot derigible could be held by the single tether cable. Another obstacle that builders of the empire state building faced was safety how most derigibles from outside the U.S at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable. This made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the empire state building. These were some of the many obstacles that the builders of the empire state were faced with.
656	15489	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION2's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the challenges associated with using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles. One major concern is the use of highly flammable hydrogen gas in international dirigible travel, posing a significant risk of a Hindenburg-like disaster above New York City. Additionally, the unpredictable and rapidly changing winds at the building's peak make maneuvering dirigibles perilous. Unlike traditional landings where lead weights could stabilize blimps in windy conditions, docking at the spire lacks this essential safety measure. Moreover, existing regulations prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, rendering docking at the Empire State Building illegal. These practical obstacles ultimately dashed the ambitious goal of utilizing the iconic skyscraper as a dirigible mooring point."
657	15490	6	3	"Many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architect could not simply drop a mooring on top of the building's Flat roof. Like it in the Chrysler Building. Also ""rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be eliminated from inside. With a step-back to imitate the overall shape of the building itself."" It in the Empire State Building. This innovative design not only overcame the challenges of docking dirigibles but also added a touch of elegance and sophistication to the iconic structure."
658	15491	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of their main challenges was designing the framework to bear the stress of dirigibles docking at the building. The builders had to ensure that the structure could withstand the load and wind pressure from the dirigibles, transmitting it all the way to the foundation. To address this, they utilized different types of steel in the construction process.  Another significant obstacle for the builders was safety concerns. Dirigibles from outside the United States predominantly used highly flammable hydrogen, posing a risk for potential disasters. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, adding another layer of complexity to the project. Moreover, the builders had to consider the safety of pedestrians below, who would be moving through the streets while dirigibles were docking high above them.  Overall, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, such as designing a sturdy framework and ensuring safety in the presence of hydrogen-filled dirigibles and shifting winds, required meticulous planning and execution to create a successful structure that could accommodate these unique docking needs."
659	15492	6	3	There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building. This idea was hardly practical, for safety reasons mostly. If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building. Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catastrophic. The task of actually docking would be a problem as well. With such a high altitude, winds were very strong. Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building. In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights. However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York. Lastly, there was a law against low flying air ships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
660	15493	6	3	In trying to build a dock at the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, the workers faced numerous obstacles. One significant challenge was that the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast onto the building's flat roof. This was because it would only be held by a single cable tether, putting excessive stress on the structure. To reinforce the building and make it capable of supporting the mooring mast, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would be required.  Another obstacle that the workers encountered was nature itself. The winds at such heights were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult to safely dock dirigibles. One proposed solution was to attach lead weights to weigh down the back of the dirigibles, but this was deemed impractical and unsafe.  Furthermore, legal restrictions posed a challenge to the construction of the dock. Laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie to the Empire State Building. These legal barriers further complicated the feasibility of the project.  In conclusion, the ambitious plan to build a dirigible dock at the top of the Empire State Building was thwarted by a combination of structural limitations, natural obstacles, and legal restrictions. Despite the innovative vision, the practical challenges proved too significant to overcome, ultimately preventing the realization of this unique transportation hub.
661	15494	6	3	"In an attempt to allow dirigibles, otherwise known as zeppelins or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles. One major concern was the structural stress that would be imposed by dropping a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. This would necessitate modifications to support the additional weight. Additionally, the prevalent use of flammable hydrogen in dirigibles posed a significant safety risk, particularly after the tragic destruction of the ""Hindenburg."" The unpredictable nature of air currents at the building's height further complicated the docking process, as winds constantly shifted, making it challenging to secure the dirigibles. Furthermore, the use of weights to stabilize the airships could endanger pedestrians below. Lastly, existing laws prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, making docking at the Empire State Building illegal. Despite the ambitious goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at this iconic skyscraper, these obstacles ultimately proved insurmountable."
662	15495	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to it because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to dock or fly a ship in New York City. Additionally, the presence of tall buildings surrounding the Empire State Building posed a significant obstacle for dirigibles to navigate safely. These obstructions would not only make it challenging for dirigibles to land but also increase the risk of collisions and accidents, further complicating the feasibility of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for airships.
663	15496	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind was too fast for the builders at that altitude, posing a risk of dirigibles crashing into stores below. Second, the building couldn't support the weight required for dirigible docking, leading to structural concerns. Lastly, the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in dirigibles raised the risk of fire hazards. These challenges collectively made the idea of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible mooring mast unfeasible and unsafe.
664	15497	6	3	Durining the @DATE1 and the 1930s, there was a fierce competition arising over constructing the largest building. To set the Empire State Building apart from the @ORGANIZATION1 decided to put a mooring mask for dirigibles. This would have both meaning and make the Empire State Building the worlds largest building. The mooring mask was certin to fail for a few reasons. For one, forign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flamable and would cause a huge fire @CAPS1. Another reason is above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantely shifting. This would make it very difficult to control the dirigible. Pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty @CAPS2 their dirigible. Lastly the mooring dock failed because of the law. This law stated that it is illegal to fly air ships to low over urban areas. On 1931 @CAPS3 Clavan @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 of the mooring mask. By the late 1930's the Idea was dead.  One major factor that contributed to the failure of the mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was the lack of suitable technology at the time. The dirigibles used hydrogen, which posed a significant fire hazard, especially in a busy urban area like New York City. Additionally, the unpredictable winds and currents above the building made it challenging for pilots to safely maneuver the dirigibles for docking. Furthermore, legal restrictions on flying airships too low over urban areas further hindered the feasibility of the mooring mast. Ultimately, the impracticality and safety concerns surrounding the mooring mast led to its abandonment by the late 1930s.
665	15498	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the lack of suitable landing areas in the urban setting of New York City. Unlike in open fields where dirigibles typically land, docking at the Empire State Building would have posed a risk to pedestrians on the streets below. Additionally, safety concerns arose due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in most dirigibles. The possibility of a tragic accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster occurring above a densely populated area was a significant deterrent. Furthermore, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The threat of forceful winds was also a major issue, as they could potentially blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings, leading to a punctured shell and endangering the lives of those on board. Considering these obstacles, it is evident that the mooring mast was not a well-thought-out idea and would have posed significant safety risks if implemented.
666	15499	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structural and safety issues. The stress that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add to the frame required costly modifications. Additionally, the safety concerns regarding the highly flammable hydrogen used in most dirigibles, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster, posed a significant risk to pedestrians below. Despite existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas, the unpredictability of violent air currents could potentially puncture the dirigibles' shells. Overall, the challenges of structural integrity, safety hazards, and unpredictable weather conditions made it difficult to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
667	15500	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. One problem was the constant shifting winds on top of the building, making it too dangerous to land a blimp. Despite adjustments to the mast design, it remained a safety concern. Another issue was the combustible nature of the dirigibles filled with hydrogen, posing a threat if a blimp caught fire like the Hindenburg. Debris falling on pedestrians below was a significant risk. Additionally, a law prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas, further restricting the usability of the mooring mast. Ultimately, due to these laws, the nature of dirigibles, and the design challenges faced, the mooring mast was not utilized.
668	15501	6	3	Another obstacle that hindered the dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building was the lack of suitable landing equipment or infrastructure. Without proper docking mechanisms or landing platforms, it would be challenging for the airships to safely approach and attach to the building. Additionally, the limited space around the building for maneuvering and docking further complicated the mooring process. These obstacles collectively posed significant challenges for dirigibles attempting to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately preventing them from utilizing the structure as a mooring mast. Despite the initial vision of using the building as a docking station for airships, various practical limitations and regulatory constraints impeded the realization of this ambitious concept.
669	15502	6	3	The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in actually docking dirigibles there. While the concept was groundbreaking and promising, safety concerns, weather conditions, and legal restrictions posed significant obstacles. The flammable nature of hydrogen gas used in dirigibles raised serious safety risks, as a single accident could potentially endanger countless lives in the bustling streets of New York City. Additionally, the strong winds at the building's pinnacle made it challenging for airships to approach and dock safely. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over densely populated urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of utilizing the mooring mast. Despite initial enthusiasm for the idea, these practical difficulties ultimately limited the use of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
670	15503	6	3	"Based on the information given in the excerpt, the obsticals that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were critical to the usage of the dock. Not only is it a challenge to build 102 story building but when factoring in wind and other weather conditions it is not an easy task: In order for the builders of the Empire State Building to create and hoist the dock the top they needed to first reinforce the skeleton of the building itself. ""The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (paragraph @NUM1) When constructing the mooring mast, the builders had to think about the violent wind speeds and the structure of the building to support itself. There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to work through to complete their project. These challenges required strategic planning and innovative solutions to ensure the safety and stability of the building while incorporating the dock into its design. By addressing these obstacles, the builders were able to overcome adversity and successfully construct the Empire State Building with a functional and secure dock at its peak."
671	15504	6	3	The obstacles to the successful use of the morning mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This natural phenomenon made it challenging to predict the direction and intensity of the wind, creating difficulties for individuals attempting to utilize the morning mast effectively. Despite the best efforts of those seeking to harness the power of the mast, the unpredictable nature of the winds remained a formidable obstacle to their success. In order to overcome this challenge, innovative solutions and advanced technology may be required to navigate the turbulent air currents and achieve the desired outcomes with the morning mast.
672	15505	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Despite their efforts with the mooring mast, the dirigibles were not able to successfully dock due to the challenging nature of the task. However, the @CAPS1 year blimp Columbia made an attempt to fly up and deliver news papers to the Empire State Building as a publicity stunt. Unfortunately, this stunt was not successful either. Despite these setbacks, there is potential for dirigibles to be used for transportation in the future, offering a promising alternative for air travel.
673	15506	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles were numerous and challenging. Dropping a mooring mast on the smooth roof was not feasible, as it would put immense stress on the building's frame. The steel frame had to be reinforced to support the weight and wind pressure of a dirigible. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of wind currents posed a significant challenge, as the dirigible would constantly be at risk of instability. Moreover, the law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the possibility of docking a dirigible to the building. Despite attempts to make this design work, the idea was ultimately abandoned due to these obstacles and concerns.
674	15507	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. If the blimp was docked over a large city like New York City, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock, as the strong winds at such heights could make it difficult for the airships to stay in place. Ultimately, the risks and challenges associated with docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building proved to be insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious idea.
675	15508	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified. The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame. For this reason they first had to make $1 million worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen its frame. The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety. After the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would have been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as New York City. It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though. Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast. The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on its back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because if the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody. The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place. In the end, the fact that there were so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all.
676	15509	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle they faced was nature itself. It says in the exerpt that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here. Another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly to low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that ""these was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of news papers. They didn't have the right equipment so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope. These obstacles were very important to be construction of the mast because it's probably saved the lifes not only the aviators but the people that lived in urban cities below. The challenges faced by the builders in allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast were significant and highlighted the dangers and complexities involved in such a venture."
677	15510	6	3	"In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire state Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it didn't work. One of the dirigibles, the USS Los Angeles, managed to stay anchored for a brief period, but the challenges were too great to make it a viable option for regular use. Ultimately, the idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles proved to be impractical and was not pursued further."
678	15511	6	3	Their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. The first problem they faced was safety. Alot of dirigible especialy those from out side the unitestates used hydrogen which is highly @CAPS1. So this was not safe in a place with a big number of population like down town New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because In case of an accident there could be a large amount of deaths. The second ob stacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stable in one place. Instead it would just go around and around the mast. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas. So It was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire state building. Another challenge they encountered was the limited space available at the top of the building for a dirigible to dock safely. Furthermore, the logistics of transporting passengers and cargo from the dirigible to the building would have been complex and time-consuming. Despite these challenges, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State building captured the imagination of many, showcasing the ambition and innovation of the time.
679	15512	6	3	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would be reaching the height of 1,250 feet, surpassing the Chrysler Building, by adding a top or a hat. John @CAPS1 highlighted that this addition would serve a practical purpose, as the top of the Empire State Building would be designed to accommodate the needs of the emerging age of transportation. Specifically, plans were made to allow for the docking of dirigibles, or blimps, at the building's peak.  However, several obstacles arose during the planning stages of this endeavor. The idea of mooring a thousand-foot dirigible to the building with a single cable raised concerns about the additional stress it would place on the structure. Estimates indicated that over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would be necessary to reinforce the building adequately.  Furthermore, the prevalent use of hydrogen in dirigibles posed a significant safety risk, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building, characterized by violent air currents, made the prospect of dangling dirigibles above pedestrians both unsafe and impractical.  In conclusion, while the notion of utilizing the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles was ambitious, the practical challenges and safety concerns surrounding the plan ultimately rendered it unfeasible. The dream of incorporating air transport into the building's design was overshadowed by the realities of structural limitations and safety hazards.
680	15513	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mass. Also the body of the dirigibles they could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off. However, due to the high speeds of dirigibles, it was challenging to ensure a smooth docking process without causing damage to the airship or endangering the passengers. Finding a solution to this issue was crucial in order to fully utilize the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles.
681	15514	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles while building a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State building. One was that they had to strengthen the foundation so that all the stress on the building's structure wouldn't tear it apart. Additionally, it was impractical for a dirigible mast because shifting currents and winds would either make it impossible to land or would circle the blimp around and hit buildings. The workers faced these obstacles and finally realized that they couldn't do it. Ultimately, the challenges of reinforcing the foundation and navigating the unpredictable wind patterns led to the decision to abandon the idea of a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
682	15515	6	3	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 outlines the problems architects faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The idea was deemed impractical due to safety concerns. Most dirigibles utilized highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a significant risk in the event of an accident that could potentially harm pedestrians in New York City. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the city's winds made it challenging to control the dirigibles, even when they were docked. Some dirigibles tried using lead weights to stabilize themselves, but this solution was deemed unsafe as it could endanger people below. Furthermore, air laws prohibited dirigibles from approaching the area, making the construction of mooring masts illegal. In the end, the idea of mooring masts for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was never realized, as it was clear that the concept was neither practical nor safe from the outset.
683	15516	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia amidon @CAPS1, there were a few obstacles faced while trying to build a dock for the Empire State Building. The lack of a suitable landing area in a crowded city like New York posed a challenge, as the airship needed ample space to avoid colliding with other structures. Safety was another concern, as the constantly shifting winds on top of the building could potentially cause the airship to swing back into the structure. Additionally, the danger of the weights being suspended over pedestrians on the street added a serious risk, as any failure could result in tragic consequences. These obstacles highlight the complexities involved in building a mooring mast for airships and the need for careful planning to ensure the safety of both the airship and the people below."
684	15517	6	3	Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the empire state Building had to be modified and strengthened to accomodate it with the new situation, which the cost was going to be over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When the dirigibles were going to land the back of the ship was going to swivel around the mase causing it to not be safe.
685	15518	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to withstand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an incident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedestrians wasn't safe. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there. Additional modifications were needed to ensure the safety and stability of the dirigibles while docking at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complexities involved in integrating airship docking facilities into existing structures.
686	15519	6	3	During the attempt to build a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building, it became evident that there were numerous obstacles that made this idea unfeasible. One major issue was the building's foundation, which would need significant reinforcement to support the weight and stress of a massive zeppelin. Additionally, the strong air currents at the top of the building posed a serious risk to any moored blimps, as they could potentially collide with the structure and burst into flames. Given the flammability of hydrogen, a disaster similar to the Hindenburg explosion in 1937 could have catastrophic consequences if it occurred above a densely populated area. Ultimately, for the safety of the city below, the docking station for dirigibles was never constructed.
687	15520	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big problem they faced was the wind. The way the mooring station was built meant that the wind could catch the tail of the dirigible, causing it to spin around the building. Also, when the mooring station was completed, the wind made it unsafe for dirigibles to get close to the building. Another problem they faced was the stability and support of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's Framework."" This was so a blimp wouldn't pull the mooring station off the building. One final problem they faced was the safety of the people. It is said that most dirigibles use flamible gasses to fly. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg over the busy New York streets it would be terrible. There were many problems faced by the building crew of the Empire state building, wind, stability, and safety are just a few. The challenges of wind control, building stability, and public safety were significant hurdles that had to be overcome in the effort to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
688	15521	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the very important obstacles they had to face was the thousand-foot dirigible adding stress to the building's frame. Therefore, they had to modify and strengthen the structure to accommodate this new situation. Additionally, the builders faced the obstacle of safety, as dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This posed a significant risk to the building and its occupants. Furthermore, nature presented a challenge as the winds at the top of the building caused the back of the dirigibles to swivel around the mast, making it difficult to dock safely. Previous solutions used lead weights to weigh down dirigibles, but this was not feasible with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, preventing dirigibles from approaching the building. Despite these obstacles, the builders worked to find solutions to make the Empire State Building a docking station for dirigibles.
689	15522	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing it, including safety concerns, technological limitations, and challenges in planning the mooring mast. Safety issues arose due to the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles from other countries, as well as the strong winds at the building's height making dirigible landings risky. Technological constraints made it difficult to safely land a large dirigible on top of the building without compromising its structural integrity. In terms of planning, insufficient foresight led to the realization that the mooring mast was impractical from the outset. Overall, the builders encountered various hurdles in ensuring the safety and feasibility of the mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
690	15523	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to prohibit dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obstacle was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attempts they decided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The risks and challenges associated with docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building ultimately led to the decision to postpone the project for a future date when these issues could be addressed more effectively."
691	15524	6	3	"The builders faced many problems in their attempts to allow a dirigible to land at the Empire State Building. One of the main reasons was safety, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I would have been to large of a risk to allow such a dirigible over New York. Another problem was the air currents, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would forever prohibit any airship to dock with the mast, or even approach the city to attempt to dock. These challenges posed significant obstacles for the builders in their efforts to make the Empire State Building a dirigible-friendly structure."
692	15525	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were safety, nature, and laws. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable instead of helium. If a dirigible were to catch on fire above a very populated the city the outcome would be bad. The winds that high were very violent. There was no way to keep a dirigible still, even though the front is hooked to the building the back would swing. It was not safe. There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal to fly close to the building or to dock at it.
693	15526	6	3	The building of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles, particularly with the addition of a mooring mast at the top. The extra weight of the mast posed a significant challenge, requiring expensive modifications to reinforce the building's frame. Additionally, regulations on airship height in urban areas limited the practicality and safety of using the mast. The risk of fire from foreign dirigibles using hydrogen further complicated the feasibility of the project. Strong winds and air currents also hindered the construction of the mast, making the idea of using the building's top as a docking station for airships unrealistic. Ultimately, these obstacles made it clear that the mooring mast was not a viable addition to the Empire State building.
694	15527	6	3	There were many obstacles that the workers had to overcome to succeed in the process of building the mast on the Empire State Building. They needed to figure out how to land the large aircraft on the small framed building and safely get passengers on and off while the tail was in the air. Consulting with the U.S. Naval Air Station for their expertise in dirigibles was crucial. Additionally, they had to navigate the law against low-flying aircraft in New York. These challenges required careful planning and collaboration to successfully complete the construction of the mast on the iconic building.
695	15528	6	3	To ease the stress on the Empire State Building's foundation caused by the addition of the mooring mast, architects decided to incorporate a system of guy wires. These wires would be attached to the corners of the extension, distributing the weight of the dirigible more evenly across the building's structure. This innovative solution not only ensured the safety and stability of the building but also allowed for the successful completion of the mooring mast project. By carefully considering the structural challenges and implementing effective solutions, the architects and construction workers were able to overcome the difficulties of building at such a height and achieve their goal of creating a functional and iconic structure in the heart of New York City.
696	15529	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle being too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigible would somehow have to be connected to the frame, which was @NUM1 feet below. Another problem the builders faced was safety. The workers wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but realized hydrogen is flammable. Other problems were nature and law. Nature's winds would complicate the dirigibles from staying still. Law stated that the dirigibles would be flying too low for urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that led to a failed plan. Ultimately, the combination of structural stress, safety concerns, and regulatory hurdles proved insurmountable for the ambitious project of allowing dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper.
697	15530	6	3	Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and German dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.  It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.  Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about $1 million to fix.  Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. German models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.  Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way.
698	15531	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock included the challenge of using an electrical winch tied to the mast to counteract wind pressure. They needed to find an open field and secure the structure with lead weights to prevent it from being blown away. However, they were unable to tie the building or install the necessary mooring equipment due to legal restrictions. Ultimately, the dominance of airplanes led to the decline of dirigibles as a mode of transportation.
699	15532	6	3	Some problems the designers faced included the violent air currents that form in urban areas, which could toss the dirigible around due to its light weight. Additionally, landing a dirigible over a densely populated area like New York City would be too dangerous due to the potential risks involved with such a maneuver. These challenges presented significant obstacles in the development and implementation of dirigibles in urban settings.
700	15533	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were significant. The modifications needed to strengthen the building for docking were expensive, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, the shifting winds on the top of the building posed a challenge, causing the dirigibles to sway even when tethered to the mooring mast. Safety concerns were also paramount, as most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen for fuel. Moreover, laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up or even approach the building for docking. These obstacles ultimately prevented the realization of the docking plans for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
701	15534	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, three obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety concerns and legal restrictions. Firstly, most dirigibles outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen, posing a significant risk above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Additionally, the shifting violent air currents on top of the building made it unsafe for dirigibles to dangle above pedestrians on the street. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to approach or tie up to the building. Due to these safety risks and legal barriers, the Empire State Building could not accommodate dirigibles for docking."
702	15535	6	3	"According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of the mass, he seems to be overambitious. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader gets the sense of how competitive Smith was, which is a quality that can get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear to the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a lot of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort needed for this was an obstacle as well. The mast delayed completing the whole building and as @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM2, the mast caused unsolved problems and postponements. A significant reason to the failure of the mast was the issue of safety because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" These both show the impracticality of the installment of a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced. Because ambition was more important than practicality in the building of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles and failed. The challenges they encountered highlight the importance of balancing ambition with feasibility in construction projects to ensure success and avoid setbacks in the future."
703	15536	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the lack of a suitable land area, constantly shifting winds on the top of the building due to violent air currents, and the need to ensure that no sharp objects would puncture the dirigibles. These challenges had to be carefully addressed to create a safe and functional docking system for the airships.
704	15537	6	3	"From what seemed to be a very possible way to make the Empire State Building famous to realizing how hard it was going to be, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These problems included added stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the foundation would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this added stress. Not only did the builders have to worry about structural issues, but also the winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. After all of these obstacles, the builders finally realized that this ""dream"" was impossible to overcome. Ultimately, the challenges of structural modifications and unpredictable winds made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious idea."
705	15538	6	3	Furthermore, the design of the Empire State Building itself posed a challenge for dirigibles to dock. The narrow peak of the building made it difficult for airships to maneuver and maintain stability while attempting to dock. Additionally, the height of the building meant that strong winds at that altitude would make it challenging for dirigibles to remain stationary during the docking process. Considering these factors, it became clear that the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not feasible. Ultimately, the builders had to abandon the concept of a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the iconic skyscraper.
706	15539	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that United States dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigible was ever destroyed by fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York the accident could be very dangerous. One of the greatest obstacles of using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dangling lead weights to weigh it down over pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe. The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 tells a few obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to overcome these obstacles and create a docking system for dirigibles at the iconic Empire State Building."
707	15540	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she describes the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The lack of a suitable landing area in New York City hindered the expanded use of dirigibles. Moreover, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles encountered difficulties in approaching the mooring mast due to forceful winds, highlighting the dangers posed by inclement weather conditions. These obstacles underscore the intricate logistics and precise conditions required for safe dirigible travel.
708	15541	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building some obstacles they faced were challenging. One name they called the dirigibles in the 1930s was ""Transportation of the Future"". There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over open areas. The builders had to make lots of changes to perfect it. Safety was the most important factor; most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, despite the former's highly flammable nature. Additionally, the highest open observation deck intended for disembarking passengers has never been open to the public, even to this day. This careful consideration of safety measures and regulations highlights the complexities involved in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
709	15542	6	3	"The three insurmountable obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were all a matter of public safety. They should have realized that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen"" and that they were thus prone to exploding. In an urban city like New York, a thousand-foot dirigible that would cover four blocks would cause immense casualties. Secondly, violent air currents cause the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to be constantly shifting. The mooring mast would not work in that environment unless the back of the dirigible were weighted down with lead weights. The lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [would be] neither practical nor safe"". Thirdly, the importance of public safety from aircraft had already been realized in the form of a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Docking in an urban setting proved too dangerous to risk. The risks of potential explosions, the difficulties of securing a dirigible in shifting winds, and the existing laws prohibiting low flying airships all combined to make docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building an unattainable goal."
710	15543	6	3	"Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many. ""When the German dirigible 'Hindenburg' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This shows that if an accident like a dirigibles flaming up above New York, there would be many serious injuries. ""In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mass could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was extremely blowing at it. The idea of using the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building was then, dropped. Despite the initial intentions, the risks and challenges associated with docking dirigibles at the mooring mast proved to be too great, leading to the abandonment of the idea in order to prioritize safety and prevent potential disasters."
711	15544	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the need to moor a thousand-foot dirigible at the building's top without adding stress to its frame. This required careful consideration to ensure the building's structural integrity was not compromised. Additionally, financial constraints posed another hurdle, as over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were necessary to accommodate the dirigibles. However, the most significant obstacle proved to be nature itself, as the unpredictable winds could potentially shift the dirigible too much, jeopardizing the safety of the operation. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their quest to create a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building."
712	15545	6	3	Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumultuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to maneuver a dirigible at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigible to come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: airships are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a densely populated urban area would have horrific results. Additionally, the sheer size and weight of dirigibles made docking them atop a skyscraper a risky endeavor, as any mishap could lead to catastrophic consequences. In the end, despite their best efforts, the dream of a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building was never realized.
713	15546	6	3	The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building. In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1. After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City. Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air. The law also hindered Al Smith's idea. The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings. The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes. However, the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building remains a fascinating historical footnote, showcasing the innovative ideas and challenges faced in the early days of aviation.
714	15547	6	3	The obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a docking place for airships were significant. One major challenge was the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to tie up to the building. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building posed a safety hazard for any potential docking operations. The idea of using lead weights to weigh down the airships, as done in open landing fields, was not practical in this urban setting. These factors combined to make docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible and unsafe.
715	15548	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for similar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast. The challenges faced by the builders highlight the complexities involved in integrating airship docking facilities into urban landscapes, requiring careful consideration of safety, regulatory restrictions, and technological limitations.
716	15549	6	3	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mast to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldn't just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable weather, would add stress to the building's frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mast itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. This made the mass unsafe. These obstacles presented challenges that the architects had to overcome in order to build the mooring mast successfully and compete for having the highest building in the world."
717	15550	6	3	"There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done about, was the wind itself. On paragraph 1 it mentions how the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These giant- balloon like machines would constantly swivel around the mooring mast even if they were tied down. The Hindenburg disaster in May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, like downtown New York. The project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area. ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" -says the author on paragraph 2. Incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work. Additionally, the sheer size and weight of the airship required careful consideration when approaching the building for docking. The engineering challenges posed by the construction of a docking station capable of handling such massive airships were significant. Despite these obstacles, the idea of using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for airships was a daring and innovative concept that ultimately faced too many practical challenges to become a reality."
718	15551	6	3	"The empire State Building builders faced different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations ""to learn more about them first hand. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation."" This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles. Additionally, they had to consider the wind conditions at such a height, as strong winds could make it dangerous for dirigibles to dock. Furthermore, the issue of passenger safety was a major concern, as any malfunction or mistake during the docking process could have disastrous consequences. Despite these challenges, the builders were determined to find a solution that would allow dirigibles to dock safely at the Empire State Building."
719	15552	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the architects faced various obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They had to consult with experts, take tours of the equipment to be used, and understand the potential dangers involved. The architects realized that dropping a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building could lead to severe consequences, such as wind pressure and the risk of fires in a densely populated area like New York City. Despite the challenges, the architects learned about the dangers and outcomes of building the mooring mast, highlighting the importance of careful planning and consideration in such projects.
720	15553	6	3	There were many obstacles that the architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State building had to face. The first was the fact that derigibles were not becoming the next transportation craze. Without derigibles to use the mast, it would serve no purpose. Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented derigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway. A final obstacle was nature. Fierce winds at the top of the building could spin the dirigibles around, making docking dangerous and impractical. Additionally, the technology at the time was not advanced enough to ensure safe and efficient docking procedures for the dirigibles. The structural integrity of the mast itself was also a concern, as it needed to withstand the strong winds and potential impact of the dirigibles. Despite these challenges, the architects persisted in their efforts to make the mooring mast a reality, showcasing their determination and innovative thinking in the face of adversity. Ultimately, the mooring mast project was abandoned, but it stands as a testament to the ambitious vision and perseverance of the architects involved.
721	15554	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, which is four blocks in New York City. This posed the first obstacle, as there was no suitable landing spot for such a large airship. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the situation. Architects had to redesign the building to support the weight of the dirigible, adding to the challenges they faced.  The most significant obstacle, however, was the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building. While the dirigible could be tethered to the structure, the swirling winds posed a constant risk. Unlike in open fields where dirigibles were typically weighed down with cylinder blocks, doing so over a populated area like New York City was deemed too dangerous.  In conclusion, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous challenges in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles. Despite their innovative ideas and designs, the inherent risks and limitations of docking such large airships at the building proved insurmountable.
722	15555	6	3	In their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced numerous obstacles. They consulted with experts and studied mooring operations at Lakehurst, New Jersey, to understand the logistics involved. Despite their thorough preparation, the mooring mast ultimately failed to serve its intended purpose due to the uncontrollable forces of nature, particularly the strong winds at such heights. The idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles was not successful, highlighting the challenges posed by nature in achieving such a feat.
723	15556	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction. While designing the mast, the architects realized they couldn't just drop the mooring mast onto the Empire State building as this would add stress to the building's frame. So the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand these conditions. Then the builders ran into a problem with safety; the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. They then decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down, but having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to complete their goal. Overall, the planning of the Empire State building had many difficulties, from structural modifications to safety concerns and legal restrictions.
724	15557	6	3	When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible lit up on their building, the results would be even worse, for debris would fall on the busy New York streets. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of violent air currents, the winds above the building were constantly changing. Is would mean that even if docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin. Normally, lead weights held down dirigibles in fields, but over New York City would be dangerous for they could snap off and fall to the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws set in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a limit on heights above urban areas, making a dock to the Empire State building, or even just approaching it, illegal. Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law. Despite these challenges, the architects were able to navigate through them and successfully complete the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.
725	15558	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to accommodate dirigibles for docking. One major concern was the additional stress that the presence of dirigibles would place on the building, potentially compromising its structural integrity. This would pose a significant risk, especially in windy conditions, as the weight of the dirigibles could pull or sway the building. To address this issue, the builders had to invest over sixty thousand dollars in strengthening the building's skeleton or frame.  Moreover, the unpredictable nature of weather conditions posed another obstacle to the docking of dirigibles. The safety risks involved in having dirigibles hovering over the bustling streets of New York City were deemed too high. Additionally, existing laws prohibited large aircraft from flying at low altitudes over densely populated areas like cities. Consequently, even if the builders had successfully constructed a docking mast, it would have been illegal for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building.  In conclusion, despite the builders' efforts to overcome the various challenges, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building never materialized due to safety concerns and legal restrictions.
726	15559	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles were going to be hooked on top of the building, the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building. Also, after the crash of the Hindenburg, the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in New York. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. These problems caused this idea to disappear. However, despite the challenges faced, the builders ultimately decided to abandon the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building, ensuring the safety and security of all involved.
727	15560	6	3	From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles. Al Smith proposed the addition of a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock for several hours, but this presented challenges. Transmitting the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation was necessary to prevent structural issues. Additionally, the ever-shifting strength of the wind posed a significant obstacle, as violent air currents could impact the safety of moored dirigibles. Moreover, the flammability of hydrogen used in most dirigibles raised concerns for safety. Existing laws restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas also hindered the feasibility of the mooring mast. Irving Clavan emphasized the need to address the unresolved issues of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height before final installation. Ultimately, the obstacles faced by builders led to the abandonment of the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
728	15561	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, L¸sted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.  First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As L¸sted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects $1 million!  The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.  Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful. Despite their efforts, the challenges of the building's structure, the safety risks of the dirigibles, and the unpredictable nature of the winds ultimately prevented the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
729	15562	6	3	In addition to the obstacles mentioned in the excerpt, another challenge faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles on the building itself. The structure of the building did not provide a flat surface for airships to safely and securely dock, further complicating the idea of using it as a mooring mast. This would have posed a significant risk to both the dirigibles and the passengers on board, as attempting to land on an uneven surface could result in accidents and injuries. Therefore, the impracticality of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not only due to safety concerns related to airship technology and air currents but also the physical limitations of the building itself. In conclusion, the challenges faced by the builders ultimately made it clear that utilizing an open field for dirigible landings was the most feasible and secure option, ensuring the safety of all involved.
730	15563	6	3	The engineers and architects faced numerous challenges when designing the mast for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle was the weight of the dirigibles, which posed a risk of causing structural damage to the mast. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles raised concerns about potential safety hazards. The unpredictability of dirigible movements in the wind further complicated the design process. Choosing the appropriate floor for the mast was also crucial to ensure the safety of workers and passengers. These factors had to be carefully considered to create a safe and functional docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
731	15564	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the fact that most dirigibles outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Additionally, the violent air currents on top of the building posed a significant challenge for mooring the airships. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of the mooring mast project. Due to these obstacles, the mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was never completed.
732	15565	6	3	The builders faced obstacles in creating a docking area for dirigibles at the Empire State Building during the dirigibles' heyday. Al Smith proposed a plan to build a landing dock on top of the building, but it was deemed unsafe by the government. The stress from the dirigibles hanging on a single tether wire would be too much for the structure. Additionally, the hydrogen used in dirigibles posed a significant fire hazard, making it impossible for them to land on the building. Ultimately, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was not feasible due to safety concerns and structural limitations.
733	15566	6	3	"The owners of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the first obsticles they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame. This was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock. Another great concern was safety, they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of ""how much worse the accident could have been if it had occurred in a city like New York. The greatest obstacle they faced however was nature. The violent air currents caused the wind to constantly shift which would cause the docked aircrafts to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"". A law which prevented airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear to overcome. This prohibited them from not only docking there, but even approaching the area. Although this dream may have seemed possible to begin with, the builders should have realized the many obstacles making their dreams quite impossible. Despite their efforts to overcome these challenges, the impracticality of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building became apparent, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious project."
734	15567	6	3	Obstacles builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building to allow the attempt of a dirigible to dock were blind. The tuge and pull of the unforecast wind made the dock dangers for passangers and the buildings foundation. However, making such attempts were illegal for dirigibles to fly over urban areas, in case of failure. Spires as well made the drop impossible for them to approach also in case of puncher. Spending sixty thousand on modification to moor mast on the Empire State Building for the safe dock of dirigibles. The idea was lost to the creation of the modern new airplane.
735	15568	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. One of the main issues was the use of hydrogen instead of helium, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Additionally, the strong and dangerous winds at the top of the building posed a significant challenge, making it risky for dirigibles to swivel around safely. Moreover, mooring dirigibles high above pedestrians could be dangerous, as they could potentially dangle above the crowds. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, adding another barrier to the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Lastly, the sharp spires of the building posed a threat to the dirigible's shell, as they could puncture it in case of any mishap. These obstacles made it challenging for the builders to successfully implement a docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
736	15569	6	3	The existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas posed a significant obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. This restriction would prevent the dirigibles from safely docking at the mooring mast, hindering the original vision of the building as a hub for airship travel. Despite the challenges presented by this law, the builders persevered and found innovative solutions to ensure that dirigibles could still access the building. Through careful planning and cooperation with regulatory authorities, they were able to overcome this hurdle and successfully implement the mooring mast, solidifying the Empire State Building's place in history as a pioneering structure in aviation technology.
737	15570	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a mooring mast would add to much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The construction of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building presented a significant engineering challenge that required careful consideration and innovative solutions to ensure the structural integrity of the iconic skyscraper.
738	15571	6	3	They had problems with the dirigibles trying to land it thyre. The dirigible could have caught fire and it would have been worse. It was dangerous to attach piece to the part. The high wind was a problem. The dirigible could burn up fall down and people would die below. Additionally, the weight distribution of the dirigible needed to be carefully managed to prevent any potential accidents during landing. The crew had to navigate these challenges with precision to ensure the safety of everyone involved. In such risky conditions, any mistake could have catastrophic consequences. Thus, the landing process of dirigibles required utmost caution and expertise to avoid any disastrous outcomes.
739	15572	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. It was not as simple as just placing a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. They had to consider how the dirigibles would fare, strengthen the building's foundation, and create a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were able to dock using an electric winch, but the densely populated urban area of Downtown New York posed a significant safety risk. The presence of hydrogen in the dirigibles also posed a fire hazard in the event of an accident, potentially endangering those below. Additionally, airships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to regulations. The unpredictable nature of the winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, further complicated the feasibility of the project. While the idea initially seemed promising, the numerous potential risks and obstacles ultimately made it unviable.
740	15573	6	3	When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of civilians. After the mast was constructed, the high-speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful. Additionally, the technological limitations of the time made it challenging to predict and manage the various factors, such as wind conditions, necessary for the safe docking of dirigibles. The complexities involved in ensuring the structural integrity and safety of the building further complicated the realization of this ambitious vision. In conclusion, while the concept of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was innovative, the practical challenges and safety concerns ultimately hindered its successful implementation.
741	15574	6	3	The @ORGANIZATION1 faced numerous obstacles during its construction, with the threat of losing the title of the world's tallest building to the Chrysler Building being a major concern. To add height to the structure, a 185-foot spiral was initially proposed, but this did not prove to be a viable solution. The idea of incorporating a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the building was then introduced. However, this presented a new set of challenges, as the steel frame had to be extensively modified and strengthened to withstand the added stress. Safety issues also arose, given the flammable nature of hydrogen used in dirigibles and the potential risks posed by wind currents above the building. Additionally, regulations prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas further complicated the feasibility of docking dirigibles at the mast. Ultimately, these obstacles led to the abandonment of the idea, highlighting the complexities involved in realizing ambitious architectural visions.
742	15575	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a multitude of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the building frame had to be strengthened. The weight of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This meant that the building's frame had to be modified, which costed a significant amount of money. Next, it proved to dangerous to dock dirigibles to the sumptuous sky-scraper. After the Hindenburg caught fire, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. In accordance with this danger, there was a lot existing at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly, the largest obstacle engineers try to overcome was simply nature itself. Winds at the top of the building made dirigibles almost impossible to land. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles tried to dock to the mast but could not battle the wind. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower due to the various challenges they faced, including structural modifications, safety concerns, and natural obstacles like strong winds.
743	15576	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they encountered was that when moored at the top of the building the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The builders would then have to ""modify and strengthen the empire state building to this new situation."" Another obstacle the builders would have to face is that since a dirigible used hydrogen it would be highly flammable. The builders didnt want an ""accident to take place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Lastly builders would have to face the obstacle of Nature. With winds so strong up top the building the dirigibles would need to be weighted down in back with lead weights which would be neither safe nor practical dangling high above pedestrians in New York City. In conclusion ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 the builders go through many obstacles in building the empire state building. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and eventually overcame the obstacles to create a lasting symbol of innovation and engineering marvel in the heart of New York City."
744	15577	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builder of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Despite meeting with experts and investing over sixty thousand dollars in changes to accommodate the dirigibles, it was ultimately determined that the plan could not be implemented due to the stress it would place on the building's frame and foundation. The main concern was the potential impact of wind on the dirigibles while in the air. Despite the unsuccessful attempt, the Empire State Building still stands tall at 1,250 feet, surpassing the height of the Chrysler Building.
745	15578	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building faced three obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The building's pre-existing frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast, which was not part of the original plan. Additionally, the use of gas by foreign dirigibles posed a fire safety risk that could not be overcome. Finally, the violent winds around the building made it impossible for dirigibles to safely dock at the mooring mast. Despite the efforts to overcome these challenges, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was ultimately unsuccessful, falling short of Al Smith's original intentions."
746	15579	6	3	The lack of a landing area, along with the swinging body of the dirigible, presented obstacles for the Empire State Building. Additionally, the shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, further complicated the situation. Due to regulations prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, the dirigibles from @ORGANIZATION2 in Los Angeles could not approach closely enough to dock. As a result of these challenges, transportation of passengers via dirigibles was halted.
747	15580	6	3	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof, as it would add stress to the building's frame. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, with violent air currents and challenging landing techniques. The idea of having a dirigible land at such a height was neither practical nor safe, requiring caution and careful consideration.
748	15581	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced many obstacles, with the main issue being a significant safety concern. The builders envisioned the mooring mast as a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from both the country and other nations. However, a critical oversight was the fact that other countries utilized hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of the safer helium. The risk of a fire over a densely populated city like New York would be catastrophic. Additionally, dirigibles used large lead weights to stabilize themselves, making them potentially hazardous to operate over a city with pedestrians below. The safety implications of these factors were not fully realized until later stages of the project, highlighting the importance of thorough planning and consideration in large-scale construction projects. Ultimately, ensuring the safety of both the airships and the people below should be a top priority in such endeavors."
749	15582	6	3	The invention of the mass on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created a new means of transportation but arrived with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigibles to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents. An existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportation a failure and as a result, the use of the mast had disappeared.
750	15583	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle they encountered was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents. This made it difficult for them to create a safe docking area for airships. Additionally, using lead to weigh down the dirigibles was not a viable solution as it would pose a danger to pedestrians on the street below. Furthermore, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, adding another layer of complexity to the situation. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to find a safe and practical solution for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
751	15584	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was installing the mooring mast, as dropping a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof would add stress to the frame due to the weight of the blimp held by a single cable tether. This stress would transmit all the way to the building's foundation, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the structure. The cost of making these modifications was another significant obstacle, amounting to over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, safety concerns arose, particularly regarding the flammability of hydrogen used in many dirigibles. Given the densely populated urban area, an accident involving a dirigible moored at the Empire State Building could have disastrous consequences. Nature itself posed another challenge, with violent air currents causing the dirigible to sway even when tethered to the mooring mast. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas and tying up to buildings, presenting legal obstacles to mooring at the Empire State Building. Despite these practical challenges, efforts were made to overcome the obstacles and enable dirigibles to dock at this iconic structure.
752	15585	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when it came to docking Zeppelins or dirigibles due to the fierce winds at such heights. Additionally, safety concerns arose because many dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, posing a fire hazard. This issue was highlighted by the tragic destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. These obstacles had to be carefully navigated to ensure the successful completion of the iconic Empire State Building.
753	15586	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders needed more support for the building's framework. They had to use over sixty thousand dollars to buy modifications for the stressed frame. Lack of a suitable landing area was another challenge. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 1). ""Over sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 1). ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 6)."
754	15587	6	3	In addition to the challenges mentioned, the builders of the Empire State Building also had to consider the impact of high winds on the dirigibles attempting to dock. Strong gusts of wind could potentially cause the airships to veer off course or collide with the building, posing a serious threat to both the dirigible passengers and the occupants of the Empire State Building. As a result, extensive wind tunnel testing and structural analysis were required to ensure the safety and stability of the mooring mast. Ultimately, the builders' meticulous attention to detail and commitment to safety were crucial in overcoming these obstacles and successfully incorporating a mooring mast into the design of the iconic skyscraper.
755	15588	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, it was illegal to have an aircraft flying too close to a city, as there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, the building's structure would not be able to withstand the stress that a docking dirigible would cause, as it would add pressure to the building's frame. Furthermore, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a blimp to safely dock without being pushed around. These challenges made it impractical for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
756	15589	6	3	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues were a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flammable. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much worse it would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing dirigibles to dock at its mooring mast. As a result, the decision was made to permanently ban dirigibles from using the mooring mast, ensuring the safety of the building and its occupants.
757	15590	6	3	Throughout the story, workers of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their quest to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the task of securing a thousand-foot dirigible mooring at the top of the building, connected by a single cable tether that added stress to the building's frame. This setup had to bear the weight of the dirigible, as well as withstand wind pressure, and transmit these forces down to the building's foundation located eleven hundred feet below. Additionally, the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in dirigibles posed a significant risk, as any destruction of a dirigible could result in a catastrophic event in downtown New York due to the building's central location. Moreover, the constantly changing winds at the top of the building made landing a dirigible a challenging endeavor. Lastly, flying too low in urban areas was prohibited by law, further complicating the task of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building. These obstacles presented formidable challenges for the workers, highlighting the complexities involved in integrating dirigibles with the iconic skyscraper.
758	15591	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Not only were they at risk of losing the title of the world's tallest building, but some of their initial opinions were proven wrong by facts. Additionally, there was a challenge in meeting all the ambitious goals on time, leading to the need for a more realistic approach. Most obstacles stemmed from the forces of nature, such as the wind causing potential swiveling issues. Overcoming these challenges required careful planning and adaptation to ensure the successful completion of the project.
759	15592	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it explains how the developing idea of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building was eventually rejected due to many obstacles. The first design flaw that the engineers @CAPS2 was the stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame. A mass that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would be @CAPS1 in the building's foundation. The greatest obstacle the engineers @CAPS2 in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation ove a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The final obstacle the builders @CAPS2 was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong. Chapter @NUM1 it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would create a dangerous situation for the ship's passengers. In ""The Mooring Mast"", it described how it would be nearly impossible to land dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Despite the initial excitement and ambition surrounding the idea, the numerous engineering challenges and safety concerns ultimately led to the rejection of this impractical concept."
760	15593	6	3	"The Mooring Mast, authored by @PERSON1, presents two main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. With high speed air currents would cause ""the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" If the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers would be the fact it was ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe."" Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of mother nature and pre-existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome enigmatic problems. Additionally, the need for constant monitoring of weather conditions and the requirement of special equipment for dirigibles to safely dock further complicated the task at hand. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and successfully constructed a docking station for airships atop the iconic building, showcasing human ingenuity and determination in the face of adversity."
761	15594	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when it came to incorporating dirigibles into the structure. One significant challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area, which would require a substantial financial investment to accommodate a thousand-foot dirigible station. Additionally, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas posed a barrier to mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building. These obstacles ultimately hindered the use of dirigibles for transportation and contributed to the rise of airplanes as the dominant mode of air travel.
762	15595	6	3	"There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirgibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Moreover, much revision to the structure's frame was needed. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirgible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp. Additionally, there was a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles."
763	15596	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was never a feasible option due to several obstacles faced by the architects. The strong and shifting winds at the building's peak posed a significant risk to dirigibles, making mooring them with weights a dangerous proposition. Additionally, existing laws prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas, including docking at the Empire State Building. Furthermore, the tragic destruction of the Hindenburg highlighted the potential danger of a dirigible accidentally igniting and falling on New York City. These challenges collectively made it clear that accommodating dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a viable or safe option.
764	15597	6	3	"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as dowtown New York."" They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult. Ultimately, the challenges posed by safety concerns and unpredictable wind patterns made it unfeasible to establish landing gear for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
765	15598	6	3	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, workers and builders try to make a docking area for Dirigibles (blimps). In the process, they faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area, which could have been prevented by initially designing a larger space. Despite the efforts of the workers, the area was still insufficient. The greatest obstacle they encountered was the challenging weather conditions, as they failed to consider that the wind gets rougher at higher altitudes. This oversight could have been avoided with better planning and knowledge of construction principles. Additionally, the law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas posed another significant challenge. Checking for such regulations beforehand could have saved them time and resources. These obstacles could have been prevented with proper foresight, ensuring that money and time were not wasted. Ultimately, the workers and builders faced avoidable challenges that hindered the successful completion of the mooring mast project."
766	15599	6	3	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock here. One example of this is ""The Obstacle to their expanded use into New York City was lack of a suitable landing area"". This shows that the mooring mast is going to be a problem because its lacked of a suitable landing area, meaning it's to difficult for landing, it's not meant for docking. Another example is 'A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This shows that the building is not stable enough for landing for a final example ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.' This shows that the weather can change, and it will affect its landing. These examples show how in the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders faced."
767	15600	6	3	"The use of the mast on the empire state building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. Violent winds, the amount of structural support and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. The high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, and the structural support of such was extremely risky. The main interfering point however was an, ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". These things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use. Additionally, the logistics of docking a dirigible at such a height in a busy urban area would have posed significant challenges in terms of safety and maneuverability. Furthermore, the noise and disturbance caused by the aircraft would have been disruptive to the surrounding environment and inhabitants. In conclusion, while the idea of using the mast on the empire state building for dirigibles may have seemed innovative, the practicality and feasibility of such a plan were ultimately unattainable due to various technical and legal obstacles."
768	15601	6	3	"The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building were nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents moving the end of the blimp. If the blimp is moving by the wind while passangers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy to fall off. Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a concern for the safety of the Street Pedestrians. On @CAPS1 @NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous. If they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets."
769	15602	6	3	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas. The invention of docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was unrealistic and unsafe. Ultimately, the idea was not feasible due to safety concerns, structural limitations, and legal restrictions, highlighting the impracticality of attempting such a venture on a renowned skyscraper like the Empire State Building.
770	15603	6	3	"In ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The workers encountered safety issues due to the flammability of hydrogen gas used by most dirigibles from outside the United States, posing a significant risk in case of accidents. The owners of the building also realized the potential danger of such incidents occurring above densely populated areas like downtown New York. However, the most challenging obstacle they faced was the unpredictable nature of the winds on top of the building, which constantly shifted due to violent air currents. This natural element made it difficult to establish a stable and safe docking system for dirigibles."
771	15604	6	3	Some obstacles that the empire state builders had while creating the Empire state building is having to deal with all fast winds. This reason being is because the giant needle that was build on top of the building was waving back an forth, which made it harder to keep in place. Another obstacle would be bringing the dirigible or blimps towards the giant needle, as it would puncture the blimp, which was only made of cotton fabric.
772	15605	6	3	"Based on the excerpt there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the dirigibles were too big and could be dangerous. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows that it will be harder to build the mast than expected. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to be modified. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The biggest obstacle the builders faced is that it wasn't safe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."""
773	15606	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. One major obstacle was the need for a suitable landing area, which proved difficult to create. The architects realized that simply placing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof was not feasible. They came up with an idea to add something that would add stress to the building, potentially compromising its integrity. Additionally, the strong winds made it challenging to keep the dirigibles stable, prompting the consideration of adding weights to anchor them. However, the use of lead weights high above pedestrians on the street was deemed impractical and unsafe. The builders were faced with a multitude of problems that made the task at hand even more daunting."
774	15607	6	3	"This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible was a dream that would be hard-to-reach. The architects and engineers that attempted to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, including meeting with the president. ""Held by a single cable tether"" would not be stable enough to mount the dirigible because the building frame would be stress to too much. What if they were to do this, the Empire State Building have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible. But instead the architects assigned a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be complete, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast could fit in its position most of portly the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily mess up the mooring mast, due to winds, which would cause the shifting of the dirigible. Also due to a ""law against airships flying too low"" the dirigible would break that law as well. The whole attempt to make a mooring mast slowly deteriorated because of all the obstacles. In the end, the grand vision of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was never realized, as the challenges posed by nature, regulations, and structural limitations proved to be insurmountable."
775	15608	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to use $1 million worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place because of the safety issue; the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue, though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent. Additionally, the height of the building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock due to strong updrafts and downdrafts caused by the sheer size of the structure. Despite the ambitious plans, ultimately, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was deemed too risky and impractical to pursue further.
776	15609	6	3	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude. The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas. Additionally, the weight of the dirigibles could pose a challenge in terms of the structural integrity of the docking tower. Furthermore, the logistics of coordinating the arrival and departure of multiple dirigibles would be complex, requiring precise timing and communication between air traffic control and the dirigible pilots. Overall, while the idea of docking dirigibles may seem innovative, the practical challenges and risks involved make it a difficult feat to achieve.
777	15610	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building, spending over $1 million to adapt the structure for the added stress of the mooring mast. The safety concerns were also significant, especially after the Hindenburg disaster, which highlighted the dangers of using hydrogen-filled airships. The risk of a similar incident above a densely populated area like downtown New York was a major concern for the building owners. Ultimately, by the late 1930s, it became clear that the mooring mast was impractical as dirigibles gave way to airplanes. The Empire State Building's grand vision of a bustling airship port had to be abandoned, as technological advancements made it obsolete.
778	15611	6	3	The builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at The Empire State Building. The addition of a mooring mast would have placed excessive stress on the framework, requiring modifications and strengthening. Safety concerns arose due to the flammability of dirigibles and laws prohibiting low-altitude flights over urban areas. Additionally, the unpredictable winds at such heights posed a risk of collisions with neighboring buildings. These challenges, along with a decline in interest in dirigibles, ultimately led to the project's discontinuation.
779	15612	6	3	"New technology, especially in aviation, requires work to be done, thus causing many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State building a success, the builders would need to know how to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and able to set passengers on and off. A quote from the text supporting this would be ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". But the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass. The stress a dirigible would put on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the actual building. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Even with all these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed to failure for reasons the builders could not fix. Despite their efforts, the challenges of keeping the dirigible anchored securely to the building and the immense stress it placed on the structure proved insurmountable, leading to the ultimate failure of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
780	15613	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented because dirigibles were to dock there. The first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled by hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature: ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph 3). This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way. The last obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas which means that it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there were presented many obstacles as shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast. Ultimately, these challenges made it difficult for the Empire State Building to become a successful docking station for dirigibles."
781	15614	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress *** to the building.The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area.The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building.
782	15615	6	3	Competitive architect Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be the tallest and most unique building, with a top that would serve a higher purpose. The building was designed to support the age of transportation by dirigible, but the architects were unaware of the potential problems they would face. One major obstacle was safety, as dirigibles using hydrogen could be highly flammable. Additionally, shifting winds and violent air currents posed a danger, causing the back of the ship to twist around the mooring mast. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to be tied to a building. By the late 1930s, dirigibles had given way to airplanes as the preferred mode of transportation, rendering the idea of docking at the Empire State Building obsolete.
783	15616	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders faced many hard tasks. They had to ensure the stability of the mooring mast for docking purposes and add more floors to the Empire State Building to maintain its status as the tallest building. The addition of the 85th floor and the mooring mast brought the building's height to 1,250 feet. The failure of a mooring mast was a potential risk due to the highly flammable nature of dirigibles and the violent air currents in New York. These factors could cause the dirigible to sway dangerously around the mooring mast, posing a significant threat to the surrounding populated area.
784	15617	6	3	Based on the information provided, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles. Safety concerns for people on the streets below, existing laws prohibiting low-flying airships over urban areas, and the unpredictable winds at the building's height were all significant obstacles. The idea of weighting down dirigibles with lead weights was deemed unsafe due to the risk of these weights dangling above the streets. Additionally, there was a fear that strong winds could potentially push a moored dirigible into surrounding buildings, posing a serious threat to public safety. Ultimately, these obstacles made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a feasible solution.
785	15618	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigibles use different gases to stay aloft. The first obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Additionally, using a mooring mast would add stress to the building, requiring costly modifications to the framework. Moreover, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, making it risky to allow them to dock. The shifting winds around the building also posed a challenge, as the mooring mast would struggle to stay stable in the constantly changing air currents. Ultimately, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose, highlighting the impracticality of the initial design.
786	15619	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The architects could not just put the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. ""A dirigible would be held to the building by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted down to the foundation. ""The building's steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" ""Over sixty thousand dollars of modifications would have to be made."" The building was based entirely around the mooring mast. New modifications were only used to support the blimp itself and not other factors like nature winds. The structural integrity of the building had to be significantly reinforced to withstand the unique demands of dirigible docking, making it a challenging engineering feat."
787	15620	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the constructors of the Empire State building faced many difficulties while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In every building or project there must be the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Dirigibles, or blimps, were not safe in general at the time. If one burned down in the middle of the country, the death toll and cost to repair what was damaged wouldn't be as much as if it burned down in downtown New York City. One, if not the greatest, challenge the constructors of the Empire State faced was that landing flammable blimps over the middle of a city was a safety hazard which could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts of the city. This presented a significant obstacle in the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State building, as the risk of a catastrophic event was too great to overlook."
788	15621	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such an urban area like New York. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast. Ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
789	15622	6	3	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled. Ultimately, the safety concerns and logistical challenges outweighed the potential benefits of having a mooring mast for dirigibles on the iconic skyscraper.
790	15623	6	3	"In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was having to make changes to the steel frame of the building in order to have the strength to accommodate the new situation. In paragraph 1, it states that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This was a costly project as well. The excerpt also mentions that there were problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving. The dirigible would be in a very windy area, and there was only one chord attached to the building which would leave the back moving around all over the place. The challenges faced by the builders in ensuring the dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building were significant, requiring costly modifications to the building's frame and grappling with the difficulties of keeping the dirigible stable in windy conditions."
791	15624	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced the obstacles of safety, nature, and law in attempting to dock dirigibles atop the empire state building. First, it would not be safe. In the excerpt it stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In a densely populated area such as New York, they couldn't risk having a dirigible burst into the flames and cause massive chaos. Second, nature would not agree. In the excerpt it stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Because of the winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many dirigibles would be destroyed instead of held in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This was the most important reason of all. They could've taken risks on the other theories, but on this one they had no choice. They wouldn't be able to fight the law to allow dirigibles to fly that low. To conclude, the obstacles faced by the builders of safety, nature, and law could not be overcome to get the mast up and working."
792	15625	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships, one of the most obvious reasons being the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident occurred, such as a fire, the entire area would be in danger. The modifications made to the building itself were significant enough without needing any additional work done. The most important reason was maneuverability. The strong winds made it difficult and almost impossible to control the blimp, let alone dock it. The organization's law even banned aircraft of any type from flying so low. The challenges of docking airships at the Empire State Building were not only due to the dangers of high altitude docking but also because of the limited maneuverability and strict regulations in place.
793	15626	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there safely. One issue was the realization that the dirigibles would be hanging by a single cable tether, putting stress on the frame and requiring costly adjustments to strengthen it. This adjustment alone cost over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, the building's location in a densely populated area posed another challenge, as pedestrians walked below where the dirigibles would be docked. The winds at the top of the building would cause the dirigible to sway, making it difficult to use lead weights for stability due to the risk of them falling. Despite these obstacles, the builders worked diligently to overcome these challenges and successfully made the necessary adjustments to ensure the safety of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
794	15627	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was when Al Smith realized that he was close to not winning the world's tallest building. Then he announced that the building would reach 1,250 feet. That's an obstacle because without the building he can't make the dirigible, and he always wanted competition so his building had to be the winning one and he had to build the dirigible. This decision to increase the height of the building not only posed a challenge in construction but also added pressure to ensure the dirigible project could be realized. Smith's determination to have the tallest building and a functioning dirigible docking station showcases the high stakes involved in this ambitious project. Despite the obstacles, the builders persevered in their efforts to make the Empire State Building a symbol of innovation and progress in the face of adversity."
795	15628	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced several problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the flammability of hydrogen, which was used in most dirigibles from other countries. Additionally, the shifting winds at the top of the building posed a risk of the dirigible wrapping around the structure. Another challenge was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low in urban areas, making it illegal for the dirigible to approach the building. To address these issues, the builders had to invest in upgrading the framework to prevent excessive strain on the top of the building. These obstacles made it difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building, highlighting the complexities involved in accommodating airships in urban environments.
796	15629	6	3	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of this building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. To build a docking station, the architects would have to transform the whole construction of the building.
797	15630	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building came with a lot of obstacles to make it work. One obstacle is their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet long, which is equal to four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle is they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. This would add stress to the building's frame and to dirigibles moored up there. Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigibles posed a challenge in terms of maneuvering and docking them safely. Overcoming these obstacles required innovative solutions and careful planning to ensure the safety of both the dirigibles and the Empire State building. Ultimately, the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State building represented a significant achievement in aviation history.
798	15631	6	3	The workers on the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a major concern, with the risk of having a large aircraft filled with passengers hanging over a bustling city. The use of highly flammable hydrogen in some dirigibles posed a significant threat of fire, which was deemed too risky to allow. Additionally, the construction and location of the mast presented practical obstacles. The height of the mast meant that violent air currents made docking difficult, and some blimps lacked the necessary mooring equipment for a safe docking experience. Ultimately, the workers had to confront the reality that the project was unrealistic, making the task of docking dirigibles a daunting challenge.
799	15632	6	3	The builders faced a challenging obstacle as they strived to construct an overall grand building and compete with others in the process. The Dirigibles played a significant role in the construction of the Empire State Building, as they encountered tough obstacles such as strong winds, weather conditions, extreme heights, and more. To tackle these challenges, Dirigibles were a crucial asset due to their lightweight construction. Their ability to navigate through difficult conditions and carry materials efficiently made them essential for the successful completion of the project. In conclusion, the use of Dirigibles was vital in overcoming obstacles and ensuring the progress of the construction of the Empire State Building.
800	15633	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature and safety. Safety concerns arose due to the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable. This posed a significant risk to passengers and the building itself. Additionally, the violent air currents around the building caused the dirigibles to sway and rotate, making it difficult for them to dock safely. The builders had to navigate these challenges to ensure the safety of passengers and the structural integrity of the building. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building was successfully constructed, standing as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance.
801	15634	6	3	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with obstacles. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Additionally, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the added stress of docking dirigibles. The dangers of fire and the risk of endangering those below also posed significant challenges. Furthermore, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas presented a legal obstacle to the project. These obstacles combined to create a complex set of challenges for the builders seeking to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality.
802	15635	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dropping a mooring mast on the flat roof was not a simple solution, as it would add stress to the building's frame from the weight of the dirigible and wind pressure. Transmitting this stress all the way to the foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below, required significant modifications and strengthening of the steel frame. This endeavor came with a high cost, as over sixty thousand dollars worth of alterations had to be made. The architects had to carefully consider the structural implications and financial burden of accommodating dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
803	15636	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor the for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted to. The addition of the mooring mast was a crucial aspect in the construction of the Empire State Building, allowing for a unique feature that set it apart from other skyscrapers of its time.
804	15637	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, hindering their ability to safely approach the building. Additionally, the design of the building had to be modified to accommodate the weight and docking mechanism of the dirigibles, posing a significant engineering challenge. The issue of passenger safety also arose, as the shifting winds at such heights made it risky for individuals to embark and disembark from the airships. Moreover, the use of hydrogen by most dirigibles outside of the United States posed a major safety concern due to its high flammability, necessitating the use of helium which was less hazardous. These various challenges made it difficult for the builders to successfully implement a docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
805	15638	6	3	They faced challenges such as how to get the dirigibles to anchor on the building. There was really no safe way to do it. They also stated the gas that keeps it floating is highly flammable. So it was like one big safety concern. In reality, they ended up realizing it's too dangerous for them to do. If they took the chance and something went wrong, innocent people could die. They had to prioritize the safety of the public and ultimately decided not to proceed with the plan.
806	15639	6	3	The dirigibles faced obstacles such as the possibilities of fire, popping, and legal trouble. The fear of the hydrogen-filled dirigible catching fire was a major concern, especially after the tragic accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, in 1937. Additionally, the risk of the balloon popping due to various factors was worrying. There was also the fear of the dirigible being blown off course into a sharp-topped building, potentially causing a disaster in downtown New York. Moreover, the Empire State Building's push for laws restricting low-flying aircraft over urban areas added another obstacle to their plans. These challenges posed significant risks to the dirigibles and their operations in urban settings.
807	15640	6	3	The biggest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents. The winds made it impossible for dirigibles to stay still for passengers to disembark safely. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles tried to approach the mooring mast but failed due to the forceful winds, highlighting the danger posed by the unpredictable air currents. Subsequently, a law was passed that prohibited any airship from tying up to the building, solidifying the fact that the winds were a significant impediment to docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building. The structural integrity of the building was at risk due to the stress caused by the winds, further underscoring the challenges faced by builders in accommodating airship docking.
808	15641	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced more problems than expected to. One of the first problems they faced was the building's frame could not support an enormous dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"" (@NUM1). The builders were forced to modify the framework which cost a large amount of money, and proved to be a primary obstacle. Another obstacle the builders faced was the wind caused by nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). These winds could potentially make the back of the blimps swivel around the mooring mast, making it incredibly difficult or dangerous to get on or off of the dirigibles. Finally, the builders faced the problem of laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@NUM3). If ships could not even legally approach the building, the builders realized, the obstacles were too great for the mooring mast to work. After realizing all the problems and dangers associated with this idea, they decided the mooring mast would never be successful."
809	15642	6	3	Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future, surpassing the limitations of balloons. In New York City, the lack of suitable landing areas for dirigibles prompted the idea of utilizing the Empire State Building as a potential docking location. However, simply placing a mooring mast atop the building was not feasible due to the immense size of the dirigibles, which could add significant stress to the structure.  To address this challenge, engineers devised a unique solution in the form of a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower with four wings at its corners. This design not only provided a secure docking point for dirigibles but also enhanced the overall aesthetic of the iconic building. With the completion of the 102-floor structure, the top two floors were designated for observation and boarding areas for dirigible passengers.  Despite the initial excitement surrounding the mooring mast, it ultimately proved to be impractical and unsafe for its intended purpose. The builders faced numerous obstacles throughout the construction process, leading to the realization that the Empire State Building's mooring mast would never fulfill its envisioned role in the transportation industry.
810	15643	6	3	Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a dock for dirigibles had many obstacles. There were obstacles like flamable gas in the dirigibles, dangerous to be near a densely populated area, the wind were constantly shifting due to air currents, and it would be dangling high above pedestrians. These obstacles were very difficult to solve. In the dirigibles, there are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flamable if the dirigibles caught on fire. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on inocent bystanders. It also is dangerous because the winds shift a lot, and it can get popped by other objects or buildings around the dirigible. Thus, why it is difficult to turn the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles. Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a loading dock for dirigibles is very difficult to do because it is not safe.
811	15644	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign derigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by. Although a mooring mast was in theory, a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical. Additionally, the unpredictable weather conditions, such as strong gusts of wind, could further complicate the docking process and pose a risk to both the dirigible and the building itself. Therefore, despite the initial intention to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the numerous safety concerns and logistical challenges ultimately made it an impractical and unsafe endeavor.
812	15645	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. As stated, modifications had to be made to the building's framework strengthen and accommodate the new situation. Another great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were consulate shifting due to violent air currents."" This would leave the dirigibles swiveling any air above pedestrians which was neither practical or safe. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during the project which unfortunately led to the known fact that the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its purpose. Due to these challenges, the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was never realized, highlighting the complexities and limitations faced by the architects and builders of this iconic structure."
813	15646	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They would have needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building, which would have cost around sixty thousand dollars. The engineers had to devise a practical and workable arrangement, while government officials in Washington were also contemplating a safe way to moor airships to the mast. However, this idea was deemed impractical and unsafe as the mooring would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. These challenges made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
814	15647	6	3	Another challenge faced by the builders and architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of competition. During the construction process, there was a race against time as other skyscrapers were being built simultaneously, vying for the title of the tallest building in the world. This added pressure forced the construction team to work even more efficiently to ensure that the Empire State Building would be completed ahead of its competitors. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building was ultimately completed in 1931, standing as a symbol of innovation and determination in the face of adversity.
815	15648	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" it shows that it was not easy making the dirigibles a safe docking station. A struggle that was faced during this time was that dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen which is highly flammable. This meant that if it was exposed to fire it would instantly catch on fire over the world's most populated city. Another problem that was faced with the amount of wind at the top of the Empire building. With all this wind it was hard for pilots of dirigibles to steer. The wind would toss them around, pilots couldn't take their hands off the gears. These were just two of the many struggles pilots and architects had to face when docking a dirigibles at a mast. However, despite these challenges, engineers and pilots persisted in finding solutions to make dirigibles a safe docking station, ensuring the safety of passengers and the surrounding city."
816	15649	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. They consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. Additionally, they had to meet with the president of a formed airship transport company to gather all the necessary information and expertise for the construction process. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic Empire State building, a testament to their dedication and ingenuity in the face of adversity.
817	15650	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when it came to having dirigibles dock there. One major issue was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York for the dirigibles. It was not feasible to simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Safety concerns were also prevalent, especially after a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The potential for disaster in a densely populated city like New York was a significant worry. Additionally, the ever-shifting winds on top of the building posed a challenge for dirigible operations. Lead weights were used to stabilize the dirigibles, but this solution was not ideal as they dangled precariously over pedestrians. Furthermore, there were regulations in place prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles, showcasing their determination and innovative problem-solving skills.
818	15651	6	3	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There are three main reasons why the @CAPS1. S.B. was not used for the purpose it was constructed for. The point of the @CAPS1.S.B. was so that dirigibles can stop and refuel. Dirigibles is an old word for Blimps. The obstacle the @CAPS1.S.B. had to overcome were modifications, nature, and the law. They had to pay @MONEY1 in modifications on the @CAPS1.S.B. for the framework. The second was nature, the winds would make the back of the Dirigibles move around, they wanted to put weights on the back of them but that was not safe. Last but not least the law, the dirigibles can't be as low as the @CAPS1.S.B. because it's too low and they can't fly low over urban areas. Ultimately, despite its intended purpose, the Empire State Building faced challenges due to necessary modifications, natural elements, and legal restrictions that prevented dirigibles from utilizing its mooring mast as initially envisioned."
819	15652	6	3	Based on the article, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles. The structural integrity of the building was compromised by the stress caused by the weight and wind pressure of the dirigibles, necessitating costly modifications. Additionally, safety concerns arose due to the flammable nature of the hydrogen gas used in many dirigibles, as exemplified by the tragic Hindenburg disaster. The unpredictable winds at the building's summit posed further challenges, as securing the dirigibles without endangering pedestrians below proved to be a daunting task. Ultimately, these obstacles prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a prominent docking location for dirigibles.
820	15653	6	3	"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway. ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it alltogether. Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose.""Despite the ambitious vision of a dirigible docked at the Empire State Building, the challenges posed by architectural stress, unpredictable winds, and legal restrictions ultimately rendered the project unfeasible."
821	15654	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 building faced obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that it would add stress to the building's frame. To accommodate the stress sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications, and strengthening would have to be done. Another obstacle was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is flammable. if something like the German Hindenburg being destroyed by fire was to happened in New York the consequences would be much worse. Also, the wind would be an obstacle as well. It would cause the back of the ship to swivel all around the mooring mast. One of the most overlooked obstacles was that of the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and it was illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building. Clearly many obstacles to place in the attempts to allow dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building. Despite these challenges, efforts to make the mooring mast a reality continued, highlighting the determination to overcome obstacles and advance airship technology.
822	15655	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the additional stress that a docked dirigible would impose, necessitating the transmission of this load and wind pressure to the building's foundation. Moreover, the violent weather conditions at the building's summit posed a risk, as the swiveling of a tethered dirigible could potentially damage the mooring mast. This would have compromised the safety of passengers exiting the dirigibles onto a gangplank connected to the building. Additionally, navigating a dirigible to the mooring mast was complicated by strong winds that could potentially blow the aircraft off course, risking collisions with other structures in the vicinity. Ensuring the safety of the mooring mast was another significant obstacle, particularly due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in dirigibles from outside the U.S. The potential for a fire to break out over a densely populated area like New York raised concerns about the catastrophic consequences in terms of casualties. These challenges collectively posed formidable barriers to the construction of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building, requiring innovative solutions to address safety and operational risks.
823	15656	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of trouble and confusion in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. This had never been done before, and they didn't know what to expect, except for a mooring mast. Initially, Al Smith and his builders thought it was an amazing idea, the technology of the future. However, they soon encountered complications with their research on dirigibles. The process was complex due to the height at which it needed to be done, requiring a lot of practice. Subsequently, alterations had to be made to the building as it wasn't initially strong enough to hold the dirigible, costing a significant amount of money. After realizing the safety risks involved with highly flammable helium, they decided to abandon the idea. Additionally, a government law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building. Consequently, the top floors were repurposed into a soda fountain.
824	15657	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They found that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet due to the building not being strong enough. As a solution, a new steel frame was added to strengthen the structure. Additionally, safety issues arose as the air currents at such a height were extremely violent. Ultimately, it became evident that dirigibles could not safely land on the Empire State Building, despite the efforts made during construction.
825	15658	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers."
826	15659	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced constructing a correct mooring mast for the zepplins, and concerning the safety of the people in the city. They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps. The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen its base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable. Then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because the people on the street below. Also, the chemicals in the blimp were highly flammable and put people at risk. Sometimes, the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured. The builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome.
827	15660	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground. The challenges faced by the builders in ensuring dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building were immense, with the unpredictable winds at the building's peak posing a significant threat. The risk of a dirigible crashing and causing a fiery inferno on the ground added to the complexity of the task at hand.
828	15661	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included the lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles. They needed a space that would allow the airships to anchor for several hours to refuel, receive service, and allow passengers to embark and disembark. To address this challenge, a docking system was implemented using a winch to secure the dirigibles in place. This method required precision and expertise to successfully dock the airships at the designated location. Despite these difficulties, the builders were able to overcome the obstacles and create a functional landing area for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
829	15662	6	3	In the @ORGANIZATION1, there were many problems faced during the build. The architect Al Smith aimed to create a building taller than the new Chrysler Building, with a futuristic design. The first challenge was determining the building's purpose. Various ideas were considered, but Al Smith envisioned it as a hub for transportation. Specifically, he proposed using the building for boarding Dirigibles, also known as blimps, at its very top. However, safety concerns arose, leading to a review in Washington that deemed the plan too risky. Despite this, Al Smith remained determined to make his building the tallest in New York City.
830	15663	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were primarily the challenges posed by nature itself. From strong winds to extreme temperatures, the harsh conditions of New York City presented numerous hurdles during the construction process. The towering height of the building made it particularly susceptible to high winds, requiring innovative engineering solutions to ensure its stability. Additionally, fluctuating temperatures and weather patterns made it difficult for workers to consistently make progress on the project. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and ultimately completed the iconic skyscraper, a testament to human ingenuity and determination in the face of nature's challenges.
831	15664	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously way not helpful to the project. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed.
832	15665	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. If that had happened at the Empire State Building it would have had extremely drastic results. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners of the Empire State The building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock, as the altitude made docking maneuvers precarious. These challenges underscored the complexity and risks involved in the ambitious plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic building."
833	15666	6	3	During construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders faced many challenges. If they had just put a spire on top of the building, the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building. Other obstacles in their way included low-flying aircraft laws, difficult weather conditions, and safety concerns if the dirigible crashed over New York. For all these reasons, the mooring mast was doomed from the start. The difficulties encountered during the construction process made it clear that the idea of a mooring mast was impractical and not feasible for the Empire State Building.
834	15667	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she talked about the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. L¸sted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Because hydrogen is highly flammable, there would be no way that it would be safe. The building could catch on fire and be a danger for all. Additionally, nature itself would have an effect on the dirigibles. L¸sted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldn't allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because it isn't safe. Lastly, laws were an obstacle the builders had to face: L¸sted's knowledge is, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles because you can't build something that goes against the law. Because of safety, mother nature, and laws, that's what stopped the builders from building the dirigibles."
835	15668	6	3	The @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the high winds and the building struggled to stay up. The builders had difficulty getting the building to how they want it. They kept adding to the building and making it taller. The dirigibles needed it to be bigger so they could see it. The problem was that it kept on breaking or something would go wrong. They kept working on the building to try and get it right but continued to fail. They had to make their plans realistic and that was there major problem. Despite the challenges they faced, the builders of the Empire State Building eventually found a solution to allow dirigibles to dock there safely, making it a landmark of engineering and design in the heart of New York City.
836	15669	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on letting things dock there was the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said that air craft's weren't allowed to fly that low. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Also it was unsafe due to the hydrogen in the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature was a factor because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the obstacles that the engineers never thought of, the Empire State building never became a dirigible landing. The challenges posed by the law, safety concerns, and unpredictable nature ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from serving as a docking point for airships."
837	15670	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, with one major concern being the safety of the people in New York. The use of hydrogen in the dirigibles posed a significant risk of fire if the airship were to catch on fire and crash in a populated area. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents at the top of the building made it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock at the mooring mast. Even if tethered, the shifting winds could cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast, creating a dangerous situation. Furthermore, there were laws in place prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it challenging to implement the use of the mooring mast. Ultimately, these obstacles led to the quiet abandonment of the idea of using the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, highlighting the complex challenges faced by builders in incorporating dirigibles into the building's design.
838	15671	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles while trying to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Nature posed a significant challenge with violent air currents causing dirigibles to sway even when tethered. To accommodate the mooring mast, extensive modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building's framework. Additionally, the prevalent use of flammable hydrogen in dirigibles from outside the United States raised concerns, especially after the tragic incident involving the Hindenburg. These obstacles highlighted the complexities involved in incorporating a mooring mast on such a iconic structure like the Empire State Building.
839	15672	6	3	The builders had to carefully consider the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible, which was about a thousand feet long. The dirigible was held by a single cable tether, adding to the stress and difficulty of the construction process. Dropping a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat surface was not a simple task, requiring meticulous planning and hard work. Despite facing numerous obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully completed the challenging project.
840	15673	6	3	There were a few problems with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. One issue was the foundation, as the weight of the dirigible landing could potentially squish it down and cause tension. The architects would have needed to make adjustments to the foundation to accommodate the landing of a dirigible. Additionally, docking the ship would pose a hazard as it could sway back and forth around the mast, potentially causing damage or injury to people in New York. These challenges would need to be carefully addressed in order to safely and effectively allow dirigibles to dock on the iconic Empire State Building.
841	15674	6	3	"There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrolable, forceful and unexpected. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (L¸sted) @CAPS2 the winds were an issue. Another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3. The mooring mast idea, was now non-sense. Additionally, the weight of the dirigibles was also a challenge, as the Empire State Building was not designed to handle such heavy loads. These factors combined made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building."
842	15675	6	3	To resolve the issue of stress on the Empire State Building's frame caused by mooring a dirigible, engineers designed a novel solution. They planned to extend the mooring mast downwards through the building and anchor it deep into the bedrock below. This would distribute the weight of the anchored dirigible more evenly and prevent undue strain on the building's structure. Additionally, the mooring mast would be equipped with advanced shock absorbers to cushion any movements of the dirigible during mooring and disembarkation. By implementing these innovative features, the Empire State Building could safely accommodate dirigibles, marking a significant milestone in the history of air transportation.
843	15676	6	3	In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed with a mooring mast at the top to potentially dock one-thousand foot dirigibles, envisioned as the future of travel. However, numerous challenges arose that hindered this ambitious plan. The use of highly flammable hydrogen gas, the dangers of puncturing the fabric covering the steel frame, and the unpredictable high winds and rapid wind direction changes at such heights all posed serious risks. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over the growing urban area of New York City. Despite some attempts, it became evident that the project was impractical and unsafe. Ultimately, the vision of utilizing the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles proved to be unattainable, highlighting the importance of considering all factors before embarking on ambitious endeavors.
844	15677	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Consulting with experts and touring equipment and mooring operations in New Jersey, they realized that dropping the mooring mast on top of the building would stress the frame and require modifications to strengthen the steel structure. However, the most significant obstacle they encountered was nature itself. The shifting winds on top of the building caused violent air currents, making it difficult to tether a dirigible securely to the mooring mast. Even if the dirigible were weighed down, it would pose a risk to pedestrians below. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, and attempts to use dirigibles for newspaper deliveries proved to be impractical. Ultimately, the challenges posed by the unpredictable winds and safety concerns made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
845	15678	6	3	The builders faced significant challenges in rebuilding the top of the Empire State building to accommodate dirigibles. It was not simply a matter of adding a mooring mast, as the weight and stress of a dirigible held by a single cable tether would require a complete upgrade and strengthening of the building's steel frame. This extensive modification would cost over sixty thousand dollars, but it was necessary to ensure the safety and structural integrity of the building.
846	15679	6	3	To have a building built over @NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigibles/blimps to be able to dock there is dangerous and has many obstacles around it. First, the weather is not always nice. If you have a windy day, the blimp is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York, posing a serious risk. Putting lead blocks in the back would be hazardous, as you would have lead swaying over a crowd of people below. Secondly, most blimps outside of the U.S. use hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable and could potentially cause a devastating fire if ignited. Finally, blimps could not moor at the Empire State Building if it is against the law for an airship to hover too low over urban areas. These factors collectively highlight the numerous reasons why blimps could not safely dock at the Empire State Building.
847	15680	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A 200-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. The accident of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, demonstrated the potential dangers of using hydrogen, especially over densely populated areas like New York. The wind currents were also a challenge, causing the back of the dirigible to sway unpredictably. Additionally, there was a preexisting law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles made it difficult for the builders to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
848	15681	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle is described in the text as the stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's frame if moored at the top. The next obstacle mentioned is the strong winds at that height, making it difficult for dirigibles to land safely. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, posing another challenge to the project. Due to these obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately cancelled.
849	15682	6	3	"There are many obstacles that the builders faced in order to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was safety. Foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with. According to the passage ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle was whether. The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. For example, U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind, which might have resulted in a puncture in the shell of the dirigible. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area""... Because of the many obstacles that the builders faced, the Empire State building was unable to fulfill its original purpose, but is still considered a worldwide landmark today. Despite the challenges, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and ambition, showcasing the ability to overcome obstacles and create enduring symbols of progress and achievement."
850	15683	6	3	In addition to the issues with hydrogen and existing laws against flying airships too low over urban areas, the builders of the Empire State Building also faced challenges with the size and design of the mooring mast. The structure had to be tall enough to accommodate the large blimps, but also strong enough to withstand the forces of wind and weather. This required careful planning and engineering to ensure the safety of both the airships and the people below. Despite these obstacles, the mooring mast was eventually completed, serving as a symbol of innovation and progress in the field of aviation.
851	15684	6	3	When building the empire state Building, the workers faced a few problems. One was how to make it taller, as the architect of the chrysler building had raised the total height, making it the largest building in the world. Al Smith, former governor of New York, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was attaching the mast to the top of the frame. It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles. Violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, the people in charge would not let blimps dock at the Building, for fear of endangering the Public. Thus, the mast was never used. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building stands today as an iconic symbol of New York City, showcasing the perseverance and innovation of its builders.
852	15685	6	3	"People involved in the design and construction of the Empire State Building were faced with a few major obstacles in attempting to transform the idea of docking dirigibles to reality. One of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a ""cable tether"" then stress would be put on the building's frame. The builders and architects had to find a way to allow the stress to travel down the foundation of the building. They spent over $1 million modifying the framework. In paragraph 2 we read that the architects and builders worked through the obstacle of storage by putting the winches and control machinery in the base of the shaft of the ""conical roof."" This strategic placement allowed for efficient storage and operation without compromising the structural integrity of the building. By addressing these challenges with innovative solutions, the Empire State Building was able to successfully incorporate a dirigible docking system into its design."
853	15686	6	3	Although the builders dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, the builders came across many problems. One problem was the law against flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didn't work. The violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down. This would be impossible docked to the building causing the dirigible to sway around possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into consideration how densely populated New York City is. If anything ever happened to a docked dirigible like the Hindenburg many people would be affected. This is why the idea always stayed a dream. The safety concerns and logistical challenges posed by docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building ultimately proved insurmountable, highlighting the impracticality of the ambitious proposal.
854	15687	6	3	The obstacles the builders took on were difficult, and time-consuming. The only benefit the Empire State Building really had was being the tallest building in the world. They also attempted to include a dirigible docking base for future transportation but faced certain legal and technical difficulties. Adding extra bodywork to the building's structure was deemed unnecessary. These obstacles, along with time and resources, posed significant challenges for the builders.
855	15688	6	3	In addition to the stress on the building's frame and the shifting winds, the builders of the Empire State building also faced the obstacle of laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction made it challenging to find a way for dirigibles to safely dock at the top of the building. The combination of these obstacles presented significant challenges in realizing the vision of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building.
856	15689	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author writes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1) It was reported that the winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. A dirigible on the building would not be able to land properly or be weighted down with lead weights like those in open landing fields. It would not be practical to dangle weight over the heads of hundreds of people walking in the streets below. In addition to nature itself, safety was another great obstacle that the builders were faced with. It is written that, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located. An accident had already occurred with a German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. When all is said and done, nature and safety were two obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These challenges ultimately led to the decision to abandon the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles."
857	15690	6	3	What the builders are faced with while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, one of them was nature. The winds at the top of the building were always shifting cause of violent air currents. Even if they were able to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building the cable that is holding it will cause pressure to the building. They only way you could have the building not have pressure on it was to modify the building so it can get stronger that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even if they were able to get around all these obstacles there is a law against airships flying to low over the city. So either way it would not have been able to happen. The challenges presented by nature, structural modifications required, and legal restrictions all combined to prevent the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building, ultimately making it an unattainable goal.
858	15691	6	3	A dirigible is not like a plane or a hot air balloon, it is filled with flammable gases, and to try to dock something that big on top of the world's tallest building would be extremely dangerous to the urban town below and perilous for the workers. The risk of a potential explosion or fire would pose a significant threat to the surrounding area, and the sheer size of a dirigible would make it challenging to maneuver and secure in such a confined space. It would be a reckless and ill-advised endeavor that could have disastrous consequences for all involved.
859	15692	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, there were also concerns about the structural integrity of the building. The weight and size of the dirigibles posed a significant risk to the building, as it was not originally designed to support such massive aircraft. The modifications required to strengthen the framework of the building were extensive and costly, totaling over sixty thousand dollars. Furthermore, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable, raised fears of potential disasters if a blimp were to crash while attempting to dock at the mooring mast.  Moreover, the unpredictable and strong winds at the top of the building presented a serious obstacle for dirigibles attempting to dock. The gusts of wind could cause the back of the ship to sway uncontrollably, making it difficult and dangerous for the pilots to maneuver the blimp into position. Additionally, existing laws prohibited aircraft from flying at low altitudes over the city, further complicating the feasibility of using the mooring mast for dirigibles.  In conclusion, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock were numerous and significant. The structural modifications, safety concerns, and logistical issues surrounding the docking of dirigibles made it a daunting task that ultimately proved to be unfeasible. Despite the ambitious vision of incorporating a mooring mast into the iconic building, the practical limitations and risks associated with dirigible docking ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea.
860	15693	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary challenge was designing the mast without the need for extensive reconstruction of the building. Additionally, ensuring the safety of having dirigibles dock at the building was a major concern, given their flammability. Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of weather posed a significant problem, as it could not be altered or controlled. These obstacles had to be carefully considered and addressed to make the concept of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building a reality.
861	15694	6	3	The problems that the Empire State Building faced were numerous. One major issue was the lack of clear regulations regarding aircraft flying near the building. The tragic incident of the Hindenburg burning to the ground highlighted the dangers of not having strict laws in place. Additionally, the building had to contend with the unpredictable nature of the winds at its height, which caused difficulties for dirigibles trying to dock. Moreover, the structure of the dirigible itself posed a threat to the building's integrity, as repeated landings could potentially damage its structure. These obstacles posed significant challenges for the Empire State Building.
862	15695	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The sheer size of the dirigibles, also known as blimps, posed a significant challenge as they were too large to navigate close to the building. Additionally, the majority of dirigibles outside the United States utilized highly flammable hydrogen instead of the safer helium, raising the potential for catastrophic accidents over the city. The violent winds above the building further complicated the docking process, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel unpredictably around the mooring mast even if tethered. These difficulties made it clear that the original purpose of the top of the Empire State Building for dirigible docking was too risky to be practical."
863	15696	6	3	In the making of the Empire Building, the builders faced several problems that hindered their progress. One major issue was the use of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, in the balloons instead of the safer option, helium. This posed a significant risk of causing fatal accidents. Additionally, strong winds made it difficult to control the movement of the balloons, leading to potential mishaps during construction. Moreover, the low-flying nature of the balloons violated laws regarding aerial vehicles, further complicating the situation. Ultimately, these insurmountable challenges prevented the builders from carrying out their plan successfully, resulting in the downfall of the project.
864	15697	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM1). Although at first the builders looked past this, there were many other non-legal obstacles that they faced. There was also a safety issue with docking dirigibles, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM2). One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM3). With all of these obstacles it would not only be improbable, but close to impossible to dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building. Despite their initial plans, the challenges posed by existing laws, safety concerns, and unpredictable wind patterns made it clear that docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not a viable option."
865	15698	6	3	When Al Smith proposed the idea of a dock on the Empire State Building for dirigibles, it seemed like a risky and dangerous plan. Passengers would have to navigate treacherous conditions to embark and disembark from the dirigibles, putting their lives at stake. Safety concerns were likely overlooked in favor of aesthetics. Potential obstacles such as adverse weather conditions could lead to fatal consequences if the dirigibles were to veer off course and crash. Additionally, the logistical challenges of constructing a landing pad for dirigibles would require significant investment in resources and infrastructure. Overall, allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was not a wise decision, as it posed serious risks to both passengers and the public.
866	15699	6	3	"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature, and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen-filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been too dangerous of a risk. In 1937, a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes, winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally, the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempts at docking of the building, the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The captain of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were overlooked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock. Ultimately, safety concerns, unpredictable winds, and legal restrictions all contributed to the impracticality of allowing dirigibles to dock on the iconic skyscraper."
867	15700	6	3	"While constructing the mast to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flammable hydrogen, which could be detrimental to the congested New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building if exploded. Additionally, the unpredictable wind currents on top of the building posed a significant challenge, making docking highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""  Despite the possibility of strapping lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it was deemed impractical and risky to the public. Moreover, even if the docking station was completed, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building due to an existing law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.""  Ultimately, the obstacles that stood before the Empire State Building's mast were too great to overcome, leading to the project's postponement. With the advancement of airplane technology, dirigibles became obsolete, and the idea of docking them at the Empire State Building was abandoned."
868	15701	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is the winds on top on the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. Also the dirigibles use Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. So if it blows up, there gonna be a lot of bad things going on in New york. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over Urban areas. The building would have to be modified and strengthened before the dirigibles could go there. Furthermore, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock, as the landing platform would have to withstand strong winds and provide a secure landing spot for the airships. Additionally, the logistical challenges of fueling and maintaining the dirigibles at such a height would require significant infrastructure and resources. Despite the potential benefits of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, these obstacles proved to be insurmountable, leading to the eventual abandonment of the idea.
869	15702	6	3	@ORGANIZATION1 on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L√ºsted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the builders faced was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized the potential catastrophic consequences of an accident in a highly populated area.  The greatest obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents. Weighting the dirigible down with lead weights was considered, but the safety concerns of having these weights hanging above pedestrians were paramount.  The last obstacle the builders faced was the legal restrictions against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for any ship to dock at the Empire State Building. Despite their best efforts, these obstacles proved to be significant challenges in the quest to allow dirigibles to dock at the @ORGANIZATION1 on The Mooring Mast.
870	15703	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle. In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways? The challenges of docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building were far more complex than initially anticipated, with factors such as flammable hydrogen, shifting winds, and legal restrictions on urban airspace complicating the process.
871	15704	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that it was strictly hard for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Many dilemmas and complications the builders faced. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work.
872	15705	6	3	The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation, requiring modifications and strengthening. The use of hydrogen in dirigibles, known for its flammability, posed a significant safety risk, especially after the Hindenburg disaster. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents made safe docking for the blimps a challenge. Attempts to use lead weights for stabilization were deemed impractical and unsafe. Furthermore, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas prevented the dirigibles from landing at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the obstacles faced by the builders of the mooring mast made it clear that the project was not feasible and raised concerns about its safety and practicality.
873	15706	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. To accommodate a mooring mast on the building's flat roof, the steel frame had to be modified all the way from the foundation, costing over sixty thousand dollars. However, even after the mast was built, additional problems arose. Dirigibles using flammable hydrogen, common at that time, were deemed too risky to fly over the populated city of New York. Furthermore, the strong winds at the building's height caused issues with the dirigibles being able to dock properly. Despite efforts to overcome these obstacles, the impracticalities and dangers proved insurmountable. Consequently, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
874	15707	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was that it was very dangerous to have a hydrogen (highly flammable) filled dirigible dock over one of the most densely populated areas at the time. They could not let the accident that had happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey happen in New York: ""..., The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes: ""The winds on top of the building were consular shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigible would not be able to stay steady for docking or unloading. Other ideas to solve this problem like weights were, ""neither practical or safe."" The final obstacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". As shown, It was simply impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building because of natural causes, danger, and the law itself. Ultimately, the challenges posed by the combination of these factors made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building."
875	15708	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the structure of the building, after the mast was designed they needed a building that could withstand the stress of the mast. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. They were able to overcome that obstacle. Another obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" @CAPS1 obstacles did that bring? Well, hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey, the owners of the ""Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. The obstacle brought upon another obstacle of practicality. Dirigibles customarily landed in open fields. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building made it unsafe the only solution would be tethering the dirigible and weighing down the back with lead weights but using these at the building ""dangling high over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". Architects faced many obstacles in their quest to make dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, but ultimately, they had to abandon the idea due to safety and practicality concerns."
876	15709	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Building. One of the greatest reasons was safety, as most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable compared to helium. Additionally, the violent air currents on top of the building posed a challenge, causing the back of the ship to sway uncontrollably if tethered to the mooring mast. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, there was no way to attach lead weights at the top of the Empire State Building to stabilize the ship. Moreover, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. These various obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building, despite attempts to overcome the challenges posed by safety concerns, wind conditions, and legal restrictions.
877	15710	6	3	The builder of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the Mooring Mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. Another issue was safety and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably. Additionally, the sheer size and weight of dirigibles posed a challenge, as the Empire State Building was not initially designed to withstand the stress of a docking airship. Moreover, the unpredictability of weather conditions, especially wind patterns at such heights, made docking and mooring a risky endeavor. Despite these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building showcased the ambitious vision of the builders, even though it ultimately proved to be unfeasible due to various safety and structural concerns.
878	15711	6	3	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to accommodate dirigibles. The addition of a thousand-foot dirigible tethered to the building would place stress on the frame, necessitating modifications to transmit the stress all the way down to the foundation, a daunting task that would require over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, a decorative mast with four wings had to be designed to house the mooring arm. However, unforeseen issues arose; the dirigible would swivel uncontrollably without the use of lead weights to anchor it in place. This, combined with concerns about flammability and existing laws, presented further obstacles that the builders had not anticipated. Despite their efforts, the challenges surrounding the mooring mast at the Empire State Building proved to be more complex than initially thought, highlighting the intricate nature of integrating dirigible docking capabilities into such a structure."
879	15712	6	3	There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was too great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast. Additionally, the structural design of the Empire State Building was not suitable for docking airships, as it lacked the necessary infrastructure and support systems required for safe and efficient mooring. Therefore, despite its impressive height and iconic status, the Empire State Building was not a feasible option for dirigible mooring.
880	15713	6	3	"Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they would have to faced was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's frame. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as L¸sted points out in paragraph, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigibles down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigibles down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles as a mode of transport were substantial, encompassing structural modifications to the building's frame, the unpredictable nature of air currents at that altitude, and the dilemma of safely weighting down the dirigibles without endangering those below. In conclusion, the ambitious endeavor of establishing a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was met with numerous hurdles that ultimately rendered the concept unfeasible."
881	15714	6	3	When builders attempted building a structure to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building in New York, they faced numerous obstacles. The addition of stress to the building's frame required costly modifications, amounting to sixty thousand dollars and increased labor. Moreover, the unpredictable winds on top of the building posed a challenge, causing the dirigible to sway uncontrollably and hindering passenger boarding. Additionally, the use of lead weights, common for mooring blimps in open fields, presented a safety hazard in the densely populated city, potentially endangering pedestrians. Despite the ambitious goal, the impracticality of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building became evident due to these significant obstacles.
882	15715	6	3	There were many obstacles that the engineers of the Empire State Building faced, one of them being the redesigning of certain parts of the building to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. The engineers had to create a mast for the airships, but they encountered difficulty when they realized that the flat roof of the building could not support the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible moored by a single cable tether. This stress would have to be transferred to the building's foundation, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the steel frame. Additionally, the engineers had to work on the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, ensuring precise installation for everything to function properly. These were the challenges that the engineers faced in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
883	15716	6	3	The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights. If weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the Hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe. The idea was good but not probable to be safe. Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigibles posed a significant challenge in terms of maneuvering and controlling them during the docking process. This, combined with the unpredictable weather conditions at such heights, further heightened the safety concerns surrounding the proposed docking of the aircraft. Ultimately, while the concept of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was innovative, the potential risks and safety hazards outweighed the benefits, leading to the abandonment of the idea.
884	15717	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, there was an obstacle faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame. Therefore, the architects had to modify and strengthen the building, spending over sixty thousand dollars on the new modification. The building was expanded from 81 floors to 102 to accommodate the dirigible passengers. In conclusion, the architects overcame the obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ensuring the safety and stability of the structure.
885	15718	6	3	There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause many tragedies because it would be above people's homes. For the same reason, there was a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities. In addition to the safety risks for people below, there was the issue of wind causing problems for docking. The wind could prevent the blimp from docking correctly, and even if it were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship could swivel around. An attempt by the Los Angeles dirigible to reach the building was abandoned due to wind concerns. The captain feared that the wind could cause the dirigible to fly into one of the spires of a tall building and be punctured, as he had to maintain constant control to prevent this. Therefore, it was clear that using the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was not a feasible option.
886	15719	6	3	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed designers discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transmit stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind, this is very unsafe being close to a building. Additionally, the size and weight of the dirigible needed to be carefully calculated to ensure it could safely dock on the mast without causing damage to the structure. Despite these challenges, the idea of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was a testament to the innovative spirit of the time. Although the mooring mast was never used as intended, it remains a fascinating part of the building's history and a reminder of the ambitious vision behind its construction.
887	15720	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, challenges arose when attempting to dock dirigibles at the mast. The height of the mast caused the tail of the dirigibles to swivel due to violent winds, potentially endangering the safety of those on board. Additionally, foreign dirigibles often used hydrogen instead of helium, making them flammable and posing a risk to the surrounding area. These obstacles had to be carefully navigated to ensure the safety of all involved in the docking process.
888	15721	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, they didn't realize that the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame"" and in order to fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for modifications for the building's framework. Another problem they encountered, besides the fact that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" was that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to get close enough to dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would damage the dirigible's shell. An alternate problem faced by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable."" They realized how unsafe it would be to have an accident like that ""above a densely populated area."" And so, builders were forced to stop their work. Additionally, the public outcry and fear surrounding the Hindenburg disaster further cemented the decision to cease plans for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the challenges and risks involved in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building proved to be insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious project."
889	15722	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to dock dirigibles. Safety concerns were at the forefront of these issues, with the highly flammable and explosive nature of hydrogen gas posing a significant risk. A fire accident could have been catastrophic given the dense population of downtown New York. Additionally, the inability to weight down the tail of the dirigible, as is customary, raised concerns about the stability of the airship in windy conditions. The risk of the blimp being punctured by sharp edges on nearby buildings added to the complexity of the docking process. Moreover, the stress that mooring a dirigible would place on the building itself was a cause for alarm. In addition to these technical challenges, legal restrictions on low-altitude flights over urban areas presented a significant obstacle, making it illegal to even attempt to land a dirigible. Furthermore, the lack of proper mooring equipment further hindered any potential success in docking dirigibles. Despite facing numerous obstacles in building the mast, the lack of preparation and failure to address obvious problems emerged as the builders' most significant hurdle in achieving their goal.
890	15723	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. As a result, despite the initial plans, dirigibles were never able to dock at the Empire State Building.
891	15724	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. In 1931, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to accommodate the mooring mast. However, architects realized that the mooring mast was never going to fulfill its purpose due to safety concerns. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, which posed a great risk, especially in a densely populated area like New York City. The potential danger to people in the vicinity led to the decision to abandon the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles.
892	15725	6	3	In addition, the strong winds in the area posed a significant challenge to the construction process. The gusts could potentially affect the stability of the building and make it difficult for workers to operate at such great heights. Furthermore, the existing laws and regulations regarding air traffic presented a hurdle for the builders. Restrictions on the height at which airships could fly over the city meant that special considerations had to be made to ensure compliance with these rules. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic Empire State Building, which stands as a testament to their ingenuity and determination.
893	15726	6	3	Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unplausable. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out.  Additionally, the sheer size of dirigibles would have made it difficult for them to navigate the urban landscape safely. Maneuvering such large airships in close proximity to buildings and other structures would have posed a significant risk of accidents and collisions. The noise generated by the engines of the dirigibles would also have been a major concern for residents living in the vicinity of the mooring mast.  Moreover, the infrastructure required to support the regular docking and maintenance of dirigibles would have been extensive and costly. The construction of a mooring mast would have necessitated significant modifications to existing buildings and utilities, as well as the installation of specialized equipment for refueling and servicing the airships. The ongoing operational costs associated with maintaining a dirigible docking facility would have been prohibitive, especially given the limited commercial viability of dirigible transportation.  In conclusion, while the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles in New York City may have seemed innovative, the numerous practical challenges and regulatory restrictions made it unfeasible. The architects and engineers ultimately had to abandon the concept in favor of more conventional forms of air transportation.
894	15727	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. By allowing the dirigibles to dock there, They had to build @CAPS2 planfronts on the side of the building, which means that they would be putting there life's in danger. They also had to deal with the electrical problems within and without the building. The @CAPS1 on the outsides of the building would have to deal with the strong wind currents. They also have to make sure that the electrical system was working properly. If there were to be a stark of any sort of Fire, the hydrogen and helium were extremely flameable, and if a wire were too short, it could like the whole dirigible aflame and it would blow up. The workers on the Empire State Building had to constantly be vigilant and skilled in order to manage the risks associated with the dirigibles docking there. They had to navigate through various challenges and ensure the safety of both the building and the dirigibles. This required meticulous attention to detail and expertise in handling the complex operations involved. Despite the obstacles they faced, the workers persevered and successfully managed the operation, showcasing their dedication and capability in overcoming challenges.
895	15728	6	3	The Empire State Building faced difficulties to have the dirigibles dock there. Wind pressure from the dirigibles messed up the building's framework. To accommodate the situation, they paid over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building's framework. This significant investment was necessary to ensure the structural integrity of the iconic skyscraper and prevent any potential damage caused by the docking of dirigibles. By reinforcing the building's framework, the Empire State Building was able to continue operating safely and efficiently, maintaining its status as a symbol of architectural excellence and innovation in New York City.
896	15729	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety concerns were a significant issue, as dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen for buoyancy. This posed a serious risk, especially considering the potential danger of a fire breaking out over a densely populated city like New York. The tragic incident involving the Hindenburg in 1937 highlighted the catastrophic consequences that could occur in such a scenario.  Additionally, nature presented a formidable challenge to the construction of a mooring mast on top of the building. The unpredictable and shifting winds at that height made it incredibly difficult for dirigibles to safely dock. The violent air currents on the building's rooftop further complicated the situation, rendering the idea of a mooring mast unfeasible.  In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles for docking were primarily safety concerns related to the flammability of hydrogen and the uncontrollable nature of wind patterns at such heights. These challenges ultimately prevented the realization of a mooring mast on the iconic skyscraper.
897	15730	6	3	Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch. The body of the dirigibles swang in the breeze. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical. They worked really hard. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some @ORGANIZATION1 of mooring airships to the mast. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service. The addition of the mooring mast revolutionized air travel, providing a safe and efficient way for dirigibles to refuel and service, ultimately enhancing the transportation industry.
898	15731	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area, as the dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to four city blocks. Additionally, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the vicinity. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles encountered difficulties when trying to approach the mooring mast due to strong winds. Even if they managed to get close enough to tie up, the captain could not release the control levers for fear of the wind blowing the dirigible into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, potentially puncturing its shell. Moreover, to accommodate the dirigible, the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to its framework. These challenges posed significant barriers to the inclusion of dirigibles at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complex and intricate nature of such an endeavor.
899	15732	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to facilitate dirigibles docking on the structure. Initially, they had to ensure that the mast was not too heavy for the building, leading them to make several modifications to support its weight. Safety was a paramount concern, considering the transportation of individuals via dirigibles depended greatly on wind and climate conditions. Additionally, surpassing the height of the Chrysler Building was a necessity to revolutionize transportation in New York City. Ultimately, it became apparent that docking on the building posed too many risks to public safety, prompting the builders to abandon the idea."
900	15733	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" the excerpt went through obstacles such as competition. If the men were not trying to compete, the buildings would probably have been okay. If you take your time and really try to reach your goal, you can. This shows that sometimes, competition can lead to negative outcomes, and taking a patient and focused approach can lead to better results in the end. It is important to consider the consequences of our actions and ensure that we are not sacrificing quality for the sake of winning a competition."
901	15734	6	3	"In the article ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there was primarily centered around safety concerns. The potential risks posed by dirigibles docking at the building were deemed too great, especially considering the densely populated area surrounding the building. The owner of the Empire State Building acknowledged the disastrous consequences that could have occurred if an accident had taken place above a crowded urban area like downtown New York. Moreover, the idea of utilizing an open landing field weighted down with lead, suspended high above pedestrians on the street, was deemed impractical and unsafe. These safety considerations ultimately led to the decision to not allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
902	15735	6	3	In the @DATE1's, people faced challenges when constructing iconic buildings like the Empire State Building. Architects encountered difficulties such as the non-flat roof, which prevented them from simply dropping a mast on top. Additionally, concerns arose over the structural integrity, as a thousand-foot drop would strain the frame. To address these issues, adjustments had to be made, including changing the frame material from steel to glass and modifying the roof design. Despite the obstacles, the men of the @DATE1's persevered through hard work to successfully build the Empire State Building.
903	15736	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons such as safety, nature, and the laws. The greatest reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. This accident could have been much worse if it happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obstacle to get around because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around. This is not good because it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Finally, there are laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, because of these three major reasons, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
904	15737	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was noticing that the dirigibles would be unsafly dangling high above pedestrians on the Street. There were many risk when landing the huge dirigibles and also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even approach the area. Famous and important dirigibles had lots of trouble with their landing like for example on December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mask but could not get close enough because of forceful winds. The dirigible could move uncontrolably and crash into the Sharp Spires on other buildings around it. In @CAPS1 of becoming the of transportation of the future, dirigibles had given way to airplanes.
905	15738	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there are many, mainly it is a safety concern. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", stated the article. ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."" This shows the dirigibles are impracticable and a danger to both the people in it and the people on the street below. Additionally, the unpredictable weather conditions could pose a significant risk to the dirigibles trying to dock, potentially leading to accidents and casualties. As a result, the decision to not allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a wise one, prioritizing the safety of all individuals involved."
906	15739	6	3	The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, and the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns, unpredictable wind patterns, and legal restrictions made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
907	15740	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, obstacles such as dirigibles themselves, nature's winds, and laws prohibiting dirigible docking had to be overcome to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. Some dirigibles, particularly those from outside the state, used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that posed a threat to New York City due to their massive size, equivalent to about four city blocks. Moreover, the wind caused these dirigibles to swivel even when tied down securely. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, risking the arrest of the dirigible's captain. These challenges made the task of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building a complex and risky endeavor."
908	15741	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in building the Empire State Building were primarily related to nature. The violent air currents at the top of the building posed a challenge, with winds constantly shifting and creating difficulties for construction. Additionally, the issue of mooring dirigibles at the building proved to be problematic. While dirigibles could be weighted down at open landing fields, it was not practical or safe to do so at the Empire State Building, especially considering the risk of dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street. Moreover, the sheer size and height of the building presented further challenges. For instance, mooring a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building with a single cable tether would have added significant stress to the structure. These obstacles required careful planning and innovative solutions to overcome during the construction process of the iconic Empire State Building.
909	15742	6	3	In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. One major challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area, leading to the innovative idea of passengers using a gangplank to access an open observation platform. Additionally, the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. This required significant modifications and strengthening of the steel frame of the building to accommodate the new situation. However, despite these efforts, the idea of the mooring mast ultimately failed due to unforeseen issues such as natural elements, legal restrictions on airship altitude over urban areas, and the risk of fires from hydrogen gas used in some dirigibles. The builders' oversight of these potential problems led to the ultimate downfall of the mooring mast concept.
910	15743	6	3	If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued. If they were to use the Empire State Building, They would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process. Even then if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. All in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea.
911	15744	6	3	Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obstacles the architects had to overcome to achieve this goal. Initially, the building's structure was not strong enough to support the weight and force of a dirigible. To address this issue, the architects had to reinforce the frame of the building to ensure its stability and safety.   Once the frame was secure, another challenge arose with the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tethered to the mast, the other end would be susceptible to the wind, making the docking process difficult and potentially hazardous for unloading cargo and passengers. Additionally, there was a significant safety concern with dirigibles being prone to catching fire, posing a threat to those on the ground.  In the end, it was determined that docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building would not be safe or feasible. Despite the initial idea of combining air travel with the iconic skyscraper, the risks and challenges involved made it clear that the concept was not practical.
912	15745	6	3	While the Empire State Building was being built, the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, in charge of the project, aimed to construct the tallest building. Initially, the Chrysler Building posed a challenge as it had a hidden 185-foot spire, making it taller than the Empire State Building by 46 feet. However, a silver lining emerged when the need for a dirigible landing area presented an opportunity. By adding a mooring mast at the top of the building, dirigibles could anchor for refueling and service. Despite this innovative design, safety became a concern. Dirigibles primarily used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, rather than helium. The risk was evident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. If a similar incident were to occur in a densely populated area like New York City, it would be catastrophic. These challenges were among the many faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.
913	15746	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety issues were a concern as most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This posed a significant risk of explosions in the populated area of downtown New York. Nature also presented challenges, as the violent air currents on top of the building caused the winds to constantly change, making it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These obstacles hindered the builders in their efforts to allow dirigibles to land on the iconic skyscraper.
914	15747	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying too low. Although, this had happened two dirigibles had attempted to moor there the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to receive them. In result the idea was shelved. Despite the challenges faced, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building ultimately proved unfeasible due to safety concerns and existing regulations.
915	15748	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were mainly safety concerns. Safety was a critical issue due to the high population density in New York City. Furthermore, another challenge was the fact that dirigibles outside the United States primarily used hydrogen instead of helium. At such great heights, the strong winds could cause the blimps to sway uncontrollably, as they were only tethered at the front. This instability could potentially lead to a blimp colliding with the sharp spires of nearby buildings, resulting in a dangerous situation. Given the numerous risks involved, it was ultimately a wise decision to abandon the idea of the mooring mast.
916	15749	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included the challenge of docking dirigibles using an electric winch. This winch would haul in a line from the front of the ship and then tie it to a mast, allowing the dirigibles to be securely docked. This process required precision and careful coordination to ensure the safety of the airships and those on board. Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building were able to overcome these obstacles and successfully implement this innovative docking system.
917	15750	6	3	Well the dirigibles were airships flying too low over the city and urban areas. The U.S @ORGANIZATION2 approached the mooring mast to tie up but the winds were too forceful. Additionally, a Goodyear Blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt where it tied up to deliver a bundle of newspapers. The presence of these airships in the sky added a sense of excitement and wonder to the cityscape, showcasing the marvels of aviation technology. Despite the challenges faced by the airships in the windy conditions, their presence left a lasting impression on onlookers below.
918	15751	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to make it safe for dirigibles to dock there. Three main issues they encountered were adding stress to the building, safety concerns, and urban laws. The architects realized that a dirigible moored at the top of the building would place additional stress on the frame, as a single cable tether would not be sufficient to support it. Moreover, the windy conditions at the top of the building posed a safety risk, with violent air currents constantly shifting. To address these challenges, the architects decided to shorten the building. Despite their efforts, a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas ultimately rendered the idea unfeasible. In the end, despite their hard work, the architects were unable to overcome these obstacles and make the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible docking.
919	15752	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the skyscraper. With limited space in New York for landing, the idea of having dirigibles anchor on the building for refueling and passenger transfer was considered. To address this, architects and engineers collaborated with experts and the U.S. Naval Air Station to test the feasibility of using electric winches to dock the dirigibles safely. The Navy, with its expertise in dirigibles, offered its airships for testing the docking mast. Additionally, discussions with the president of an airship transport company that operated across the Pacific were held to explore potential services. Despite the obstacles, efforts were made to overcome challenges and make the Empire State Building a hub for dirigible operations.
920	15753	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 people faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is they would have to have different make new Routes that was yet to get made and existing transatlantic Routes. These challenges would require significant planning and resources to overcome. Additionally, there would likely be logistical issues to address, such as coordinating with air traffic control and ensuring the safety of both dirigibles and other aircraft in the area. Despite these obstacles, the builders of @ORGANIZATION1 were determined to find a solution that would allow dirigibles to dock at their location, showcasing their innovative spirit and commitment to progress in the field of aviation.
921	15754	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was trying to moor a dirigible at the top without stressing the building too much. It says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means they planned to deal with this problem by spreading this stress all the way to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, all of these obstacles that the builders faced led to the final result of being unsuccessful."
922	15755	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous challenges before establishing itself as an iconic structure. Concerns arose regarding the potential threat of sabotage, leading to the decision to minimize the docking of dirigibles on the building. The city's desire for prominence and economic prosperity drove the push for the building's completion. However, some individuals displayed apathy towards the project, causing delays in its progress. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building ultimately overcame these hurdles to solidify its place as a symbol of New York City and a renowned architectural marvel.
923	15756	6	3	"The idea of docking a one thousand feet long dirigible to a mast eleven-hundred feet above the ground never seemed possible. From the factual evidence provided in paragraphs, the theory is proven failure. ""Dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught fire trying to dock at the Empire State building, the accident would quickly turn into a catastrophe. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" The high-speed and shifting winds atop the Empire State building would cause mooring dirigibles to branish around the mast. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State building faced was the law forbidding air vessels of flying too low over urban areas. A problem that would condemn the theory from the start."
924	15757	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, they were mainly ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable"". A fire in one of these would be devastating being over an enormous city like New York. The wind currents would also make it impossible to dock there. ""The ship would swivel around the mooring mask"", and could even potentially puncture the frame. The whole idea was dangerous and risky. In fact, it would of been illegal for flying ""too low over urban areas"". Not only was it dangerous, but aganst the law too. Overall, these were the obstacles that workers faced, and the obstacles that won out in the long run."
925	15758	6	3	"In building the empire state building, the builders faced many obstacles in the process of letting dirigibles moor at the mooring mast. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the author gives us examples as to what was difficult. One obstacle in the docking of dirigibles to the mast was safety for the people inside. The article says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" It then goes on to say ""Most dirigibles from out of the U.S used Hydrogen, Hydrogen is highly flammable."" another reason was nature. The author states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to unsecure departure of passengers. The article also says ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel"" which shows unsafe air conditions. These are two obstacles that made landing at the mooring mast very difficult and soon made it impossible. Additionally, the sheer height of the building posed a challenge for dirigibles attempting to dock, as the tall structure created strong updrafts and unpredictable wind patterns. These factors combined to create a hazardous environment for airships attempting to land, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept at the Empire State Building."
926	15759	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York because of violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Also many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building."
927	15760	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock due to issues such as excessive wind movement, weight concerns, and safety risks. The wind would cause difficulties during docking, the structure lacked stability to support the weight, and safety concerns arose following the Hindenburg disaster. These obstacles underscored the complexity of integrating airship docking into urban landscapes and highlighted the importance of considering various factors when designing innovative structures.
928	15761	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles included the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in most airships, the challenging winds at the building's height, and an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. The potential danger of a dirigible accident above a densely populated area like New York City, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster, highlighted the risks associated with hydrogen-filled airships. Additionally, the unpredictable winds at the building's peak presented a safety concern, as tethered dirigibles would continuously rotate around the mooring mast. Moreover, the legal restrictions on airship flight paths in urban regions posed a significant barrier to implementing Al Smith's vision. Ultimately, these obstacles collectively rendered the plan unfeasible, preventing the Empire State Building from serving as a mooring mast for dirigibles.
929	15762	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The violent air-currents posed a significant challenge, making it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock without being blown away. Additionally, safety concerns arose due to the use of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, in the dirigibles. The risk of a potential accident involving a flaming balloon flying over a densely populated area like New York was too great to ignore. While the idea of creating docking stations for dirigibles was intriguing, the numerous obstacles and hazards involved ultimately prevented it from becoming a reality.
930	15763	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that arose was construction of the mast atop the building. According to the excerpt, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" From this you immediately know that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be properly modified in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast. Another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative. ""... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside."" Additionally, the architects had to consider the winds at that altitude, which could be too unstable for a dirigible to safely dock. The winds at such heights could potentially ""swing"" the rear of the dirigible around the mast, posing a significant risk. This obstacle emphasized the need for careful planning and structural modifications to ensure the safety and success of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
931	15764	6	3	During the construction of the empire state building, builders faced many obstacles with attempting to allow a dirigible to dock there. These problems consisted of safety and practical issues. One safety issue was that most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen was more flammable than helium, which was a significant concern due to the risk of fire. This concern was further highlighted by the tragic incident involving the Hindenburg, a German airship that was destroyed by fire.  In addition to safety concerns, the builders also encountered practical issues. It was illegal to fly an airship too low over a city, which posed a challenge for dirigibles attempting to dock at the Empire State Building. The existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas made it impossible for a ship to even tie up to the building, further complicating the possibility of dirigibles landing there.  Overall, the combination of safety concerns regarding flammable hydrogen gas and practical restrictions against flying too low over the city made it unfeasible for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. These obstacles ultimately prevented the docking of airships at the iconic skyscraper.
932	15765	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let the dirigibles dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the ""lack of a suitable landing area."" (paragraph six) A second obstacle is the amount of stress a dirigible would put onto the building. As the author states in paragraph nine, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" The author also states that in order for the invention to work out, the Empire State building's steel frame would have to have more strength to it and it would have to be modified to accommodate the new idea. The greatest obsticle faced was due to the nature of where the building was located. Because of the location, the winds were so strong and the wind shifted constantly. The last obsticle the builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By the late nineteen thirtie's, the idea landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building disappeared. Instead, the idea of air transportation was given to airplanes. Ultimately, due to various challenges and restrictions, the concept of using dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was eventually abandoned in favor of airplanes."
933	15766	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building made it challenging to construct the mooring. One significant issue was the prevalence of dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium, as highlighted in paragraph 1 with the example of the Hindenburg disaster raising concerns about the potential risks in a densely populated city like New York. Additionally, the ever-changing winds at the building's height posed a constant challenge, as noted in paragraph 2, where nature itself was described as the greatest obstacle to the mooring mast's successful use. Furthermore, legal restrictions against airships flying too low over urban areas, as mentioned in paragraph 3, made it impossible for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. These combined obstacles made the construction and use of the mooring mast a complex and risky endeavor for the builders of the Empire State Building.
934	15767	6	3	Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their efforts to enable dirigibles to dock on the iconic structure. The unpredictable nature of winds posed a significant problem, with violent air currents causing the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast and lack the necessary weight support to remain grounded. Instances like when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles struggled to get close enough to the mooring mast highlighted the difficulty of the task at hand. Safety concerns were also paramount, especially considering that hydrogen, a highly flammable gas used in dirigibles outside of the U.S., could pose a grave risk to the densely populated city below in the event of a fire. Furthermore, the sheer size and weight of the dirigibles added stress to the building's frame, necessitating modifications to support the weight of the aircraft. These obstacles underscored the impracticality and risks associated with the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the conclusion that this vision would never come to fruition.
935	15768	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building face a couple challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it. One main problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and they didn't want to have another accident like the Hindenburg. They realized that if an accident like that had happened in a densely populated area such as New York, it would have been a thousand times worse. Another challenge they faced was the sheer size of the dirigibles, as they were much larger than any aircraft that had previously landed on a building. This required careful planning and engineering to ensure that the dock could support the weight and size of these massive airships. Despite these challenges, the builders were determined to create a dock for dirigibles on the Empire State building, as it would be a groundbreaking and iconic addition to the iconic skyscraper. Ultimately, with careful consideration and innovative design, they were able to overcome these obstacles and create a safe and functional dock for dirigibles on the Empire State building.
936	15769	6	3	"How safe is it to have a large dirigible above thousands of civilians? The builders had many problems to face while attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. For one thing, the mast was not yet ready, as stated in the excerpt: ""to fix a mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date."" The landing gear was also not yet ready or sure to work. The idea of using dirigibles over such a crowded area was not even considered to be a smart decision. Given these challenges and uncertainties, the safety of having a large dirigible above thousands of civilians remains a significant concern."
937	15770	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles from Outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized it would be much more dangerous in a crowded area. A second obstacle was that the dirigible would be swiveling around the mast because of violent air currents, posing a threat to pedestrians on the street below. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Thankfully, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quickly disappeared, and the builders had no more obstacles to face.
938	15771	6	3	"The idea of Hindenburg sized air ships landing on top of the Empire State Building sounds propostorous in today's day in age. However in the 1920s this was a dream of many. Unfortunaetly this dream never came to be due to multiple obstacles faced by the builders. The first obstacle faced by the builders concerned what was in the air ship itself, hydrogen. This would be a problem because the vast majority of blimps visiting ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". So if an accident ""had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" it could be disastorous. Another major problem were the winds. They were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and so the ships could swing into other buildings. These two points aside, there was a ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" anyways. So regardless of the wind or the hydrogen it wasn't legal. These three obstacles combined made the dream of airships landing in New York stay a dream and not a reality. Despite the technological advancements and the progressive mindset of the 1920s, the challenges of utilizing hydrogen, navigating through unpredictable winds, and abiding by existing laws prevented the grand vision of airships landing atop the Empire State Building from becoming a feasible reality."
939	15772	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builder's of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock. The huge balloon caused tension and stress due to its ginormous size. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". The stress of the dirigible can cause crucial damage to the building's frame. Also, it was not only the size; the contents of some of the planes caused a crisis as well. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The worries of the balloon catching on fire were too much to risk. Along with all, is the power of nature itself. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds on top of the building were very violent compared to the ones on the ground, causing a scare. It looked all good until everything was looked at carefully; obstacles came from all different ways."
940	15773	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles also known as blimps. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure on the building that might soon collapse. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State faced was the wind on top of the building, making it dangerous for dirigibles to dock there. The winds on top of the building made it a challenge for dirigibles to safely land and take off. Therefore, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The combination of stress on the building's frame from the dirigibles and the strong winds made it difficult for the mooring mast to be effectively utilized. Despite the challenges faced by the builders, the Empire State Building still stands as an iconic landmark today, showcasing the perseverance and innovation of those who constructed it.
941	15774	6	3	In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, builders faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the wind and dirigible's weight would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, about eleven hundred feet below. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg in an area heavily populated like New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced so many obstacles that they eventually abandoned the project.
942	15775	6	3	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith envisioned the Empire State Building surpassing the Chrysler Building as the tallest building in the U.S. at 1,250 feet, with the addition of a mooring mast. However, several obstacles stood in the way of this ambitious plan. Blimps, due to their hydrogen and helium content, were highly flammable, as demonstrated by the 1937 disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The densely populated nature of New York City posed a significant risk in case of an accident, with millions of tourists flooding the area daily. The most formidable challenge, though, was the unpredictable and violent shifting winds at the building's height, causing the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Consequently, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that the endeavor to make it the tallest structure was not only impractical but also unsafe.
943	15776	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One of these obstacles was to modify the whole frame of the building. ""A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This quote from the excerpt cleary shows that the builders would have to move around this to complete their job, which would entirely make this situation an obstacle. Another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows another obstacle because builders could not find a practical way to get the passengers off, and putting lead in the back would only endanger the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows a very big obstacle, which actually happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg. Those were the obstacles that were faced by the workers during the time of attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
944	15777	6	3	Many obstacles occurred for the builders of the Empire State building and allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was the mooring mast itself. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast it would swivel around the mooring mast. Another obstacle the builders experienced during this process was the already existing law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Due to the fact that the Empire State building was in New York, an urban area, the dirigible idea would have most likely never worked. The dirigible was unable to fulfill its destiny and the obstacles the builders faced were the main reasons.
945	15778	6	3	There are some obstacles the builders face during this time while building the Empire State Building. One of the issues was the unsolved problems of mooring airships to fix a mast at a height desirable to postpone installation to a later date. The Empire State Building wasn't destined to ever fulfill its purpose. For reasons it should have been apparent before it was constructed. Another obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. This created a challenge for potential visitors and tenants who may have wanted to use air travel to access the building. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building was eventually completed and went on to become an iconic symbol of New York City.
946	15779	6	3	"There were Several obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If an accident would occur above a densely populated area, such as New York, it would be catastrophic. Another obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle the builders had was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it difficult for them to overcome these challenges and successfully implement a dirigible docking system on the Empire State Building."
947	15780	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great. Ultimately, the challenges of weather, chemistry, and construction issues proved insurmountable in the builders' efforts to facilitate dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building."
948	15781	6	3	"Complex. A building is a complex structure that cannot be easily tampered with, and still be considered safe. That is the major problem the builders had. It isn't easy you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). They had to strengthen the structure and that took ""sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" (∂ @NUM1). Plus the builders had to design a nice plan for the mast, to make it look nice. They even had to use glass which is a harder material to work with. Although the greatest obstacle the builders had was allowing the dirigible to dock. One it was filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if it ever blew up it would have killed a lot of people in the city. However ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂@NUM3). This was mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM3 and is the main reason why the idea failed. The winds were always constantly shifting, which caused the back to swivel and become unsafe. Weights on the back would have made it even more dangerous, because they could fall. Lastly laws prevented flight so close to the ground. But even so many other blimps tried, like ""Columbia"" and ""Los Angeles"", and found it was too hard to fly that close to building and dock as well. The idea had many holes in it. Despite the challenges faced, the concept of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building ultimately proved unfeasible due to the complexities of nature, structural limitations, and safety concerns associated with docking a dirigible filled with flammable hydrogen."
949	15782	6	3	In the late 1930s, dirigibles faced challenges in docking on the Empire State Building. The method of docking using an electric winch and a mast posed risks for passengers as the dirigible could sway in the wind. Additionally, the decline in dirigible popularity due to the emergence of airplanes led to the abandonment of the idea of using mooring masts for dirigibles. As airplanes took over as the preferred mode of transportation, dirigibles lost their appeal and were no longer seen as the future of travel. This shift in preference contributed to the difficulties dirigibles faced in finding suitable docking locations like the Empire State Building.
950	15783	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flammable because they used hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire, highlighting the dangers involved. Additionally, the violent winds in the area posed a significant challenge. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast due to the strong winds. The only solution of adding lead weights would have created safety risks for pedestrians below.  Furthermore, a law prohibiting airships from flying too low in urban areas added another layer of complexity to the project. This legal restriction further hindered the builders from realizing their vision of a dirigible mast atop the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders faced insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to construct a mast for dirigibles, including safety concerns, natural elements, and legal regulations.
951	15784	6	3	Builders faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The lack of a suitable landing area prompted Al Smith to propose a mooring mast at the top of the building. However, this idea presented another challenge as the mast could not simply be placed on the roof due to the structural implications. The stress and wind pressure would have to be supported all the way down to the building's foundation, necessitating costly modifications to the steel frame. Ultimately, the plan for a mooring mast was abandoned, highlighting the importance of considering potential problems from the outset in architectural endeavors.
952	15785	6	3	"In the Mooring Mast, Marcia explains how Al Smith attempts to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to allow dirigibles (blimps) to station there for several hours. The architects faced many obstacles in trying to add a mast onto the design of the Empire State Building. One of these obstacles was remodifying the building so the weight of the blimp wouldn't stress the foundation. ""A Thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" A different obstacle that delayed the progression of blimps being docked at the top of the Empire State Building was because of safety issues. Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium. And because New York was highly populated, there was no doubt that there would be frequent fires. Even the owners of the Empire State Building realized this danger on May 6, 1937. The potential dangers posed by using hydrogen-filled blimps for mooring on top of the Empire State Building were a significant concern, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the project."
953	15786	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. Safety was a major concern, as most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, making the risk of a fire incredibly high. The owners realized the potential danger of an accident above a densely populated area like downtown New York, leading them to halt the construction of the mooring mast. Additionally, the constantly shifting winds on top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast uncontrollably. Even if the dirigible could be held still against the air pressure, the stress on the building's foundation would be immense. These challenges ultimately led to the disuse of the mooring mast, highlighting the impracticality of the initial idea.
954	15787	6	3	"The first main obstacle that the builders faced was the fact that blimps, despite having propellers and rudders, are still subject to the whims of the wind. The wind on top of the building was described as ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it impossible to keep the blimps stable while moored on the Empire State Building. The naval dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock on the building but couldn't get close enough due to the fear of being blown onto sharp spires of surrounding buildings, risking a puncture in the dirigible's shell.  The second main obstacle was the concern for public safety. The potential risks of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building were significant. The blimp could explode, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, or collide with surrounding structures, leading to a catastrophic event that could result in the loss of numerous lives. These safety hazards made the idea of mooring a dirigible on the Empire State Building impractical and unfeasible."
955	15788	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety concerns were paramount, as most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. A tragic incident involving a German dirigible in New Jersey underscored the potential dangers of such a setup in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making any approach to the building illegal. Additionally, the unpredictable and volatile nature of the weather posed a significant challenge. The constantly shifting winds and violent air currents at the top of the building would have made docking a dirigible a precarious and potentially hazardous endeavor. Ultimately, the obstacles proved insurmountable, and the Empire State Building never became a mooring mast for dirigibles."
956	15789	6	3	The worker faced many obstacles while building the Empire State Building. Since Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building, he kept adding on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world, he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State Building 1,250 feet tall. The builders had to redesign the entire building's skeleton to ensure it could support the mast. The mast was designed for Dirigibles to land on it, but it was soon discovered that the violent wind currents at the top of the building made it impractical. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mast. The builders successfully fixed the steel frame within two months, and the construction continued as planned. Despite the initial setback with the mast, the Empire State Building remains an iconic symbol of New York City.
957	15790	6	3	The architects faced challenges when trying to incorporate a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. It was not as simple as placing a mast on the flat roof, as the weight of a dirigible could stress the building's frame. Significant modifications were needed to strengthen the building's foundation, costing over sixty thousand dollars. However, even with these modifications, nature presented obstacles. The shifting winds made it dangerous for airships to land, as the back of the ship could swivel unpredictably. Additionally, airships flying low over urban areas posed safety concerns and legal issues. In the end, the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was deemed impractical and risky, requiring extensive effort for implementation.
958	15791	6	3	In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. One such obstacle was the presence of dirigibles, which were massive steel-framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles could be controlled using propellers and rudders, making them a potential hazard near the building. Additionally, the successful operation of the mooring mast posed a challenge. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building, along with the risk of the mast endangering pedestrians below, made its use a complex and potentially dangerous endeavor. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered in their efforts to complete the iconic Empire State Building.
959	15792	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem they faced was that the dirigibles moored to the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame, so the stress of the dirigibles load would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation. Another problem they faced was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen so it would be very bad if one was destroyed by fire above densely populated downtown New York. Also there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to even approach the area. The challenges of adding dirigible docking capabilities to the Empire State Building were substantial and included concerns about structural integrity, fire safety, and legal restrictions on airship travel in urban areas.
960	15793	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced were avoidable. The first obstacle they encountered was the limited landing space they had. With more careful consideration, they could have likely found a solution to overcome this problem. Additionally, there were concerns about the safety of the Mast. Everyone involved, including Al Smith, should have prioritized safety from the beginning. The builders should have anticipated issues like this when attempting to construct something that had never been done before. It is crucial for future projects to prioritize safety and thorough planning to avoid similar obstacles.
961	15794	6	3	"In the beginning, all the plans made for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. Dirigibles would tie up to the mast on top of the building and dock there while the passengers got off; easier said then done. Soon enough they began to realize all the flaws in this plan, there were main issues. After seeing how easily the ""Hindenburg was destroyed by fire"" they realize it was too dangerous having dirigibles fly over such a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It was far too windy for the light dirigibles to stay in place. Along with the wind problem, if somehow a dirigible was able to be tied down ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Furthermore, unlike dirigible landing fields, it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of New York just to hold the back of the dirigibles down. Unlike previously thought, dirigibles were not the way of the future; airplanes became the newer, more efficient mode of transportation in the late 1930s. A good idea, but as they said: ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""
962	15795	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another issue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they @ORGANIZATION1 was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around. They got the idea to use lead weights on the back but it would not be safe over all those people. Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigibles made it difficult to maneuver them in such a densely populated area. Despite these challenges, the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 continued to explore ways to make dirigible docking a possibility in the future.
963	15796	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when trying to incorporate a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the structure. The addition of the mast required modifications to the framework to withstand the stress caused by the docking dirigibles, leading to increased construction costs. Moreover, the unpredictable and dangerous winds at the building's towering height posed a significant obstacle for dirigibles attempting to remain stationary while moored. Additionally, laws prohibiting blimps from flying too low over urban areas hindered the practicality of utilizing the mooring mast. Ultimately, these factors rendered the use of the mooring mast unfeasible, despite the grand idea behind its conception.
964	15797	6	3	One obstacle that the builders faced was that having dirigibles hanging over a heavily populated area was extremely dangerous, as demonstrated by the German dirigible disaster on May 6, 1937. The destruction caused by the fire highlighted the risks involved in such a venture. Additionally, it was illegal to have blimps flying too low over densely populated areas, further complicating plans for the project. Due to these challenges and safety concerns, Al Smith had to abandon the idea of using dirigibles in that particular location.
965	15798	6	3	Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building posed numerous obstacles for the builders. Dirigibles, which could be up to one thousand feet long, would have added significant stress to the building's frame, requiring extensive reconstruction to strengthen it. Furthermore, most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, posing a serious safety risk in the event of a fire that could potentially harm pedestrians below. Additionally, it was discovered that there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low, making it illegal for a dirigible to even fly near the Empire State building. These factors combined made it impractical and unsafe for dirigibles to dock on the iconic building.
966	15799	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenge of having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building was daunting, considering the Empire State Building's height of 1,250 ft. Adding a single cable tether to support the dirigible would exert too much stress on the building's frame, necessitating modifications and strengthening of the structure. Additionally, the builders encountered unforeseen issues with violent air currents and wind, further complicating the feasibility of docking dirigibles atop the skyscraper. Despite initial aspirations, the idea of having a dirigible moored at the Empire State Building eventually faded away due to these insurmountable challenges and technical constraints."
967	15800	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" By Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way; nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe. In order for it to be safe, they came to another obstacle. The entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over @NUM1 dollars worth of investment. Lastly, there already stood a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With all obstacles faced, it was never opened to the public. Despite the initial vision, the challenges of nature, structural modifications, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the dirigibles from docking at the empire state building."
968	15801	6	3	"The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to let dirigibles to dock were the wind conditions and how close dirigibles were to the building. The wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there. The winds near the top of the building were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The other problem the builders faced was how close dirigibles came to the building. In one case, as a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but it, ""could not get close enough to tie up..."". Even though the building was not what it was suppose to be it is still one of the greatest of all time. The challenges faced by the builders in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were primarily related to the unpredictable wind conditions and the difficulty of getting the dirigibles close enough to the building for docking to occur. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building remains an iconic structure, standing as a testament to human ingenuity and architectural achievement."
969	15802	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the realization that mooring a dirigible at the top of the building would place added stress on the structure, potentially causing it to swivel due to wind pressure. This would not only be detrimental to the building's foundation but also pose a significant safety risk. The cost of reinforcing the building's structure to accommodate dirigibles was estimated to be over sixty thousand dollars, making it a costly endeavor. Additionally, the flammability of dirigibles posed a serious threat, as any mishap could result in a devastating fire in the densely populated area surrounding the building. Ultimately, these obstacles led to the abandonment of the plan to have a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.
970	15803	6	3	After facing challenges with the design and construction of the dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, such as the inability of the dirigible to land on the flat roof and the need to create elevators and stairs for passengers, the builders encountered safety concerns towards the end of the project. Initially, they had not anticipated these safety issues, focusing more on the structural aspects of the building. However, as the construction progressed, it became evident that ensuring the safety of passengers boarding and disembarking from the dirigible was crucial. This required additional measures to be implemented to prevent any accidents or mishaps. Despite these unforeseen challenges, the builders persevered and successfully completed the Empire State Building, creating a landmark that continues to awe and inspire visitors to this day.
971	15804	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that the ""stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to spend over $1 million to create a frame that would be able to stand that amount of pressure. Another obstacle they were facing was that most dirigibles had hydrogen in them, which is very flammable. They were afraid that if the balloon caught on fire, it would fall down to densely populated city below. And there was nothing that they could do to change this. A third obstacle they were facing was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant that the dirigible be constantly moving around while passangers tried to get on and off, which would not be safe. These obstacles made it extremely challenging for the builders to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
972	15805	6	3	"The builders' expectations were set too high and they faced many obstacles they had not foreseen. Safety was a big issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" With a highly populated city like New York, it would have been easy for a fire to begin. Another obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock was nature. The wind at times could be too powerful. As said the reading, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These threatening winds would have made it impossible for the dirigibles to land and serve as safe transportation. The last obstacle was that it was illegal. The had @CAPS1 been a law against it. The reading states, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With this law, there was not even a glimpse of hope that this plan could be successful."
973	15806	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles when trying to make it possible to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They could not add an all steel mooring mast on top of the building because it would add too much stress to the frame and foundation of the building. If they were going to add a mooring mast, they needed to modify and strengthen the building's frame. The other problem the builders faced was safety. They had to consider the fact that many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. The Building was in a densely populated area in downtown New York City. The last obstacle the builders faced was nature. The winds on top of the building were very strong and the air currents frequently shifted. This would have made the dirigibles swivel around the mast. It was a challenging task to overcome these obstacles and find a solution that would allow dirigibles to dock safely at the top of the iconic Empire State Building.
974	15807	6	3	The Empire State Building was facing off with the Chrysler Building, which was being constructed. Chrysler Building had a trick up his sleeve by constructing a 185-foot spire inside the building, shocking the public and bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose as the tallest building.
975	15808	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When a dirigible was docked, it was held by a single cable tether, adding stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building from top to bottom would have to be modified and strengthened to address this new situation. More than $1 million was spent for modifications on the building's framework. When the owners of the Empire State Building found out about the Hindenburg disaster, they realized how much worse it could have been if it happened right over downtown New York. If there was a docking accident and the dirigible was filled with hydrogen, then that would be catastrophic for the workers and anyone else around the building. The potential risks and dangers became evident, leading to a reconsideration of the feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
976	15809	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. With downtown New York being a densely populated area, that wouldn't be such a great idea. Another obstacle they had to face was the weather itself. The Empire State Building was very high so it got really windy. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. They also weren't thinking about the government when they were building the mooring mast. There was a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low to urban areas. It would be illegal if a ship even tried using the mooring mast. Additionally, the lack of proper safety measures in place for dirigibles docking at such a height posed a significant risk to the passengers and surrounding buildings. Ultimately, the challenges of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles proved too great to overcome, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious plan.
977	15810	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced the @CAPS2 of purfictle placing a thousand foot dirigible on top of the Building which would of not worket out Because of the wind and there was no wait in the back that would of kept the dirigible in place in which now meant that the dirigible would have been swinging back and forth and gave the riesct of the dirigible poking a sharp point on the corner of the Empire State Building and exploding, the dirigible above New York City and putting thousand of life at dinger. The @CAPS1 also faced the @CAPS2 of getting too much machinery that was needed to @CAPS4 the mooring mast. Another obstacle @CAPS1 had to face was getting approval due to safety hasits because what had happened to the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building persevered and ultimately decided against the risky proposition of placing a dirigible on top of the building, ensuring the safety of the city and its inhabitants.
978	15811	6	3	In addition to these challenges, the builders also had to consider the weight and size of the dirigibles, as they needed a sturdy structure to support the aircraft. The risk of collisions with other air traffic or buildings in the busy city added another layer of complexity to the project. The need for a safe and secure docking station for dirigibles in New York was evident, but finding a solution that could overcome all these obstacles proved to be a daunting task. Despite the numerous attempts, none of the dirigibles were able to successfully dock at the Empire State Building, highlighting the unique and difficult nature of this particular engineering challenge.
979	15812	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building aced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, structural problems, breaking laws, and keeping the dirigible safe in the air. The structural problems this would have caused was the pressure on the buildings foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles. The builders were also breaking The Law because there is a law saying how low an airship can fly over an urban area, the dirigibles would be way too low. The final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air. This is due to the high winds the airship would be swinging around and could break off. Another issue would be if it blew up the pieces would fall onto downtown New York City.
980	15813	6	3	"Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over 1,200 feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by a reputable organization, obstacles included adding stress to the building's frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. The article says that ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects were the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at 1,200 feet. Safety hazards also came into account because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation."
981	15814	6	3	In addition to the challenges posed by nature and the flammability of hydrogen, the builders of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building also had to contend with existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction further complicated the already difficult task of allowing dirigibles to dock at such a high altitude. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered in their efforts to make the mooring mast a reality, demonstrating their determination and innovative spirit.
982	15815	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges while constructing the dirigible dock. The shifting winds atop the building posed a constant danger, with violent air currents making it impractical and unsafe to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast. Furthermore, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, rendering it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. The building's structure and foundation also presented obstacles, leading to over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the construction of the mast. These challenges highlight the complexity and ingenuity required to overcome the hurdles faced by the builders in their quest to create a functional dirigible dock atop the iconic Empire State Building."
983	15816	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were significant. They needed to figure out a way to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building without adding stress to the building framework. Adding the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof was not an option, as the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have been transmitted to the building's foundation nearly eleven thousand feet below. To address this issue, they decided to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Instead of a utilitarian mast, they constructed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. The 101st floor was transformed into a glassed-in observation area, while the 102nd floor became an open observation platform. These modifications not only allowed dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building but also added a touch of elegance and functionality to the iconic structure.
984	15817	6	3	Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first reason why builders faced difficulty in allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety concerns. The helium used to fill the balloons was highly flammable, posing a significant risk if a fire were to break out, endangering all of New York City. Additionally, the high winds in the area made it unsafe for the dirigibles to dock, as mentioned in the text. Paragraph @NUM1 highlights this issue by explaining how the back of the ship would swivel around, creating further safety hazards. Moreover, the builders encountered challenges due to pre-existing laws that prohibited aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. These legal restrictions posed a significant barrier to the realization of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these obstacles ultimately prevented the mooring mast from becoming a reality, highlighting the complexities and limitations faced by the builders in their ambitious plans.
985	15818	6	3	The obstacles faced during the construction of the Empire State Building were numerous. Standing at 1,250 feet, it was the tallest building in the world, presenting a significant engineering challenge. Additionally, the use of dirigibles for transportation was deemed unsafe, especially after the infamous Hindenburg disaster. The fear of a similar tragedy occurring over New York City added to the concerns surrounding the project. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited aircraft from flying too close to the city, making the concept of using dirigibles for travel seem impractical and risky. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building eventually became an iconic symbol of New York City and a marvel of modern engineering.
986	15819	6	3	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, height of the structure, stability of the structure, and worrying about the highly flammable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at its height so the dirigible doesn't knock over the Empire State Building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was necessary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught on fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch on fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used. The challenges were significant and ultimately prevented the construction of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
987	15820	6	3	"One of the big problems facing docking dirigibles is the government and the law. It is illegal to have such a low-flying aircraft. It says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle would be safety. Dirigibles are FLAMMABLE and could easily injure and kill people if an accident happened. Is to dangerous, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS2. @NUM2) Another problem is nature and weather. The winds up there are extremely high and powerful. A big danger to dirigibles, ""... violent air currents... back of the ship would swivel around... high above pedestrians,"" (@CAPS2. @NUM3). Additionally, the size and weight of dirigibles pose challenges for safe docking, requiring significant space and specialized infrastructure. Moreover, the limited maneuverability of these airships makes it difficult to navigate tight urban areas and avoid potential hazards. In conclusion, the docking of dirigibles faces various hurdles including legal restrictions, safety concerns, and environmental factors, making it a complex and risky endeavor."
988	15821	6	3	@ORGANIZATION3 elaborates on the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in implementing a mooring mast for dirigibles. Despite initial confidence from Al Smith in 1929, the project encountered insurmountable obstacles. Consultation with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station proved insufficient to overcome the difficulties, leading to the project's abandonment. The altitude of the building's peak posed a significant challenge, making docking dirigibles impractical. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of wind and the high flammability of dirigibles posed a danger to the civilians of New York. Legal restrictions further hindered the project, as laws prohibited dirigibles from flying at the required altitude for docking. While the concept of the mooring mast was intriguing and had the potential to popularize dirigibles, its impracticality and the obstacles it presented ultimately thwarted its realization.
989	15822	6	3	"The empire state building was high in the air, (@NUM1 ft) the problems were is that the building moves while it's in the air, and if you have something that is weighting around the heavy fifty-thousand pounds maybe more than the building might rip off if there is a big windstorm. The dock sounded like a good idea but you would need a winch and you would have to put some big clamps on the building to secure the balloon or dirigible to dock and refuel. In paragraph @NUM2, @PERSON1 of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" If Irving ever decides to put a blimp up and make an air station then make new technology. Who know's in the future we could have cars that fly through air, why not have balloons attached to buildings. In order to tackle the challenges of mooring airships to tall buildings like the Empire State Building, innovative solutions and advanced technologies will need to be developed. Perhaps in the future, with advancements in engineering and aviation, docking airships to skyscrapers may become a reality."
990	15823	6	3	They could not put a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Additionally, the weight and movement of the dirigible could potentially destabilize the entire structure, posing a serious risk to the safety of the building and its occupants. The structural integrity of the building would be compromised, and the potential for disaster would be significantly increased. Therefore, such a plan would be highly impractical and dangerous, and alternative methods of mooring the dirigible would need to be considered to ensure the safety and stability of the building.
991	15824	6	3	The idea of using a mooring mast at the Empire State Building for dirigibles was impractical due to various challenges faced during its development. The weight of the dirigible would have put immense stress on the building's structure, requiring significant modifications for support. Additionally, high winds would have made docking difficult, causing the dirigible to sway and potentially pose a hazard. The risk of fire was also a concern, especially if the dirigible contained flammable hydrogen. Moreover, the close proximity of the dirigible to other buildings and urban areas made it illegal and unsafe for such airships to dock at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, these obstacles led to the conclusion that constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a feasible endeavor.
992	15825	6	3	In addition to the challenges posed by nature itself, the builders of the Empire State Building also faced the issue of practicality and safety when it came to docking dirigibles. Weighting down the dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about 1,250 feet in a densely populated area like New York City was deemed impractical and unsafe. Furthermore, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building unfeasible. Ultimately, the combination of these obstacles made it clear that the concept of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was not a viable solution.
993	15826	6	3	When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building, architects and builders faced numerous challenges. In addition to the basic issues of moving people and baggage within the terminal, they had to address the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and wind pressure. To solve this, the frame of the Empire State Building was redesigned by @MONEY1. Another challenge was the constant swinging of moored dirigibles due to violent wind currents at the top of the building. Using weights to hold the airship in place was deemed unsafe for those below. Despite efforts, architects were unable to devise a secure method to stabilize the dirigible. Ultimately, the concept of a mooring mast for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building was abandoned.
994	15827	6	3	"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly posed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe."" As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building. Despite the optimism surrounding the idea, the structural limitations, safety concerns, and unpredictable nature of the winds ultimately thwarted the possibility of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building."
995	15828	6	3	The addition of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building by Al Smith was a strategic move to address the lack of landing areas for dirigibles in New York City. This mast allowed the dirigibles to anchor at the building, receive gas and service, and facilitate passenger embarkation and disembarkation. However, the use of an electric winch to dock the dirigibles posed a structural challenge to the building. The stress from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure was transmitted to the building's foundation through the steel frame. To accommodate this new situation, the building's frame needed to be strengthened or modified to handle the additional stress effectively.
996	15829	6	3	The builders faced many challenging obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The builders first talked about individuals like Al Smith to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the state, standing at a height of 1,454 feet. However, their new challenge was to create a landing area for dirigibles at the top of the building. Al Smith envisioned a space where dirigibles could refuel, receive servicing, and embark or disembark passengers. This vision presented a significant obstacle that the builders had to overcome in order to make it a reality.
997	15830	6	3	In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past. The challenges faced during the construction of the docking mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building highlighted the structural and safety concerns that arose from the use of such a facility. The potential risks posed by the flammability of hydrogen-filled dirigibles and the strain on the building's framework led to the eventual abandonment of the project. The once-promising idea of a dirigible dock has now become a relic of the past, showcasing the importance of considering all potential obstacles before embarking on ambitious construction ventures.
998	15831	6	3	The Empire State Building faced a different stage when they decided to make some repairs to it. As the tallest building at the time, these renovations aimed to enhance its structure and make it even more famous.
999	15832	6	3	"Based on the expert, the builders had many obstacles that the builders had to face, from attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders had to face was the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. The builders also had a problem with the wind because ""... the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell. Additionally, the builders had to consider the weight and balance of the dirigibles to ensure safe docking procedures. These challenges required careful planning and engineering expertise to overcome. Despite these difficulties, the builders ultimately succeeded in creating a docking station for dirigibles on the iconic Empire State Building, showcasing their innovation and problem-solving skills."
1000	15833	6	3	The architects faced obstacles when attempting to add a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock. They discovered that placing the mooring mast on the flat roof would cause stress on the building's foundation. This issue posed a significant challenge in their plans to accommodate dirigibles at the top of the iconic building.
1001	15834	6	3	Architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The idea was to have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like dirigibles, allowing them to refuel and disembark passengers. However, the plan was never executed due to various challenges. Most dirigibles outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a significant safety risk. The ever-changing winds at the building's pinnacle also made it difficult for dirigibles to be tethered securely. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further hindering the docking process. Despite a U.S. Navy dirigible reaching the mooring mast in 1930, it was unable to tie up due to strong winds, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea in favor of airplanes.
1002	15835	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. These obstacles included having to redesign and modify the building structure, the dangers of a dirigible catching fire, the swirling winds, and state law. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" This was because the building was not originally built to have that capability. This meant, in order to do this meant over sixty thousand dollars in modification had to be spent. Another obstacle faced was the natural dangers of a dirigible. Dirigibles have a likely chance of catching fire, as displayed by the Hindenburg. If that same accident were to happen over the densely populated area of New York City, it would be a catastrophe. Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, and around the mooring mast"" This would just be dangerous to have something that large spinning round and round. The last obstacle faced by builders was that state law prohibited aircraft flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it illegal for the mooring mast to be used. This probably should have been considered. Overall poor planning created very many obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there. In conclusion, the challenges faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were significant, ranging from structural modifications to safety concerns and legal restrictions."
1003	15836	6	3	Architects struggled with obstacles as they were constructing the Empire State Building. A @NUM1 ft. dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame. The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the building had been framed, the roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The mast had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. Despite the challenges faced, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and remains an iconic symbol of New York City.
1004	15837	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced obstacles in constructing the dock for the dirigibles. They had to consider the structural implications of adding a mooring mast to the building. The architects realized that simply placing a mast on top of the flat roof would not suffice, as the weight and pull of a thousand-foot dirigible tethered by a single cable would strain the building's frame. To address this issue, the builders modified their approach.  Instead of a basic, functional mast, the architects devised a sleek tower made of glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel, and internal illumination. The tower's design, with its stepped-back structure mirroring the building's overall shape, not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal but also distributed the stress more effectively. By overcoming these obstacles and incorporating innovative design elements, the builders were able to create a mooring mast that was both functional and visually striking.
1005	15838	6	3	The architects of the Empire State building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main causes was nature. Winds and air currents posed a significant risk, as there was a fear that the wind could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, potentially puncturing the dirigible. This was a problem beyond human control, as no one could predict or manipulate the wind with certainty. Additionally, another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction made it impossible to fully utilize dirigibles for transportation to and from the Empire State building. These obstacles proved insurmountable for the architects, leading to the abandonment of the original idea for the project.
1006	15839	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that they didn't really have landing gear. It was very hard to land a dirigible on the ground, but in mid-air, it was almost impossible. Another reason was that it was very unsafe. The pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about 200 feet in the sky, and if they messed up, they could potentially die. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying low over urban areas, making it illegal for people to land them there. These challenges made it difficult for the builders to create a suitable dock for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1007	15840	6	3	"There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable. Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the challenge for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only 925 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be 1,250 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.  When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"", he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of people below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, 304 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.  The greatest challenge that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at its base. Lined with steel, the structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day."
1008	15841	6	3	There were three main obstacles that the builders faced: safety, Nature, and THE LAW. The first obstacle that they faced was safety. Many blimps used Hydrogen instead of Helium. While Helium is a safe gas, Hydrogen is a combustible gas which posed a significant risk. The second obstacle they faced was Nature. The strong winds blew the Blimps off target and because they weren't aerodynamic, it was difficult to maneuver them effectively. The third obstacle was a law that stated that Blimps can't fly too low, so even without the other challenges, it would still be illegal. In conclusion, they should have built a different aircraft because they are simply better than Blimps.
1009	15842	6	3	Some obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was that the building was not stable enough to be able to moor an airship. They solved this easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton. Another obstacle that they faced was the high speed winds and being able to get passengers off and on. They never did solve this problem, and so the mooring project was shut down. The obstacles the builders faced were too many and this project soon became impossible to finish and it never was.
1010	15843	6	3	"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium,"" at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" and it would most likely to happen since there are many buildings closely to one another in New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, all of his plan's failed by the end. Therefore, the vision of docking dirigibles on top of mooring masts in Downtown New York proved to be unfeasible due to a combination of safety hazards, regulatory restrictions, and technical limitations."
1011	15844	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles during their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was the structure of the building itself. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would be held by a single cable tether, adding significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Additional support and reinforcement would be necessary to ensure the safety and stability of the building while allowing dirigibles to dock. This engineering challenge required careful planning and precise execution to successfully integrate dirigible docking into the iconic structure of the Empire State Building.
1012	15845	6	3	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was nature. That is because the wind at the top of the Empire State were changing a lot due to bad weather. The blimp would be moving around even if it was tied down the other challenge was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". That is not safe because if a blimp caught on fire at the building there are 102 floors that could burn down. Also because downtown New York is a very densely populated place. That is the obstacles the Empire State building faced in creating a docking area for blimps. Additionally, the builders also had to consider the weight and size of the dirigibles, as the mooring mast needed to be sturdy enough to support these massive aircraft. Moreover, the logistics of docking and undocking these airships in a bustling city added another layer of complexity to the project. Despite these challenges, the idea of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was a testament to the ambition and innovation of its time."
1013	15846	6	3	The mooring mast atop the Empire State Building faced several foreseeable problems before its construction. Workers encountered challenges such as constant weather crises with violent air currents causing swaying of any dirigible attached to the mast. To prevent swaying, dirigibles typically have lead dead weights, but this was impractical over crowded city streets. Furthermore, the building required reinforcement to support the dirigible's weight and transfer its energy back down to the foundation. Additionally, dirigibles flying low over urban areas posed safety concerns, especially with the prevalent use of highly flammable hydrogen gas. The Hindenburg disaster further heightened reluctance towards such projects, as the catastrophic potential over a densely populated area like downtown New York was evident. Ultimately, the concept of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building remained a theoretical idea due to the various predictable obstacles it faced.
1014	15847	6	3	In addition to the challenge of having dirigibles land on the top of the building, the builders also had to address the issue of the dirigible being held on the building by just one cable tether. This setup posed a significant risk, as any malfunction or breakage of the tether could have catastrophic consequences. To mitigate this risk, the builders had to reinforce the steel frame of the Empire State Building to ensure that it could withstand the additional stress caused by the presence of the dirigible. This was a crucial step in ensuring the safety and stability of the mooring mast, despite the numerous obstacles that the builders had to overcome.
1015	15848	6	3	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which they were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project. The engineers had to acknowledge that the dirigible dock was a well-intentioned but ultimately impractical addition to the Empire State Building, highlighting the importance of careful planning and consideration of all factors in engineering projects."
1016	15849	6	3	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was finding a way to tether the end of the blimp without it blowing in the wind or putting the people below in danger. Another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. One final obstacle was the danger of hydrogen dirigibles in general. These obstacles proved far too many to outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast. Despite the initial excitement and ambition surrounding the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building, the numerous challenges and risks ultimately rendered the concept unfeasible.
1017	15850	6	3	One of the obstacles faced during the construction of the building was the need to increase its height to ensure it would be the tallest in the area. This adjustment posed challenges for the builders as they had to continuously make alterations to the original design. Despite these difficulties, they persevered and worked diligently to address the issues, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the project. Through their determination and effort, they were able to overcome the obstacles and create a remarkable structure that stands tall as a symbol of their hard work and commitment to excellence.
1018	15851	6	3	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building. The risk of accidents and potential chaos in such a densely populated area made the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building a risky proposition that required careful consideration and planning.
1019	15852	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The number one obstacle was safety. The builders thought to themselves, How are we going to safely land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground, while it's freely floating in midair? Plus, when you attempt this, you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking, then thousands of people may lose their lives. It's much easier landing dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, you're planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesn't move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block, then many more casualties would have been recorded. These obstacles were real, and these are some of the reasons why the idea of landing a dirigible in mid-air slowly went away because it wasn't the most logical idea.
1020	15853	6	3	The obsticals that the builders face in attempting to allow dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building are the law to fly that low to buildings. They also face structural problems in the building to be able to hold a dirigible. They also could not keep the dirigibles from moving because of the wind. They faced safty ishuse because of some dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and it is highly flamable. They did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area. They did not want what happen to the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey to happen in down town New York. Dirigible have never dock there and never will because it is unsafe.
1021	15854	6	3	The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never fully completed due to several reasons. Safety concerns were paramount, especially considering that dirigibles from outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium. The tragic example of the Hindenburg disaster highlighted the dangers of such flammable gases. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent wind currents posed a significant risk, causing dirigibles to sway dangerously in the air. This movement, combined with their considerable size, made them a hazard to people below. Furthermore, laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas added to the safety concerns, as it would be illegal for dirigibles to be moored above cities with the risk of falling onto unsuspecting pedestrians. Ultimately, these factors led to the abandonment of the idea of using the Mooring Mast as a docking area for dirigibles, ensuring the safety of the public and preventing potential disasters.
1022	15855	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Governor Al Smith's determination to create the world's tallest building led to the idea of a mooring mast, which presented challenges such as the need to strengthen the building's frame to support the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure. Additionally, the highly flammable nature of dirigibles posed a risk over densely populated areas like downtown New York. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building further complicated the docking process, as the swiveling motion of the tethered dirigible was deemed impractical and unsafe. These obstacles required careful consideration and innovative solutions to ensure the safety and functionality of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1023	15856	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle was the dirigible's ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. The frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable. Anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds. The mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked. The challenges faced by the builders ultimately led to the decision to abandon the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State building.
1024	15857	6	3	The architects faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They realized that simply dropping a mooring mast on the flat roof would put too much stress on the building's frame. The cost of modifying the framework to withstand the pressure would have been significant. Additionally, there was concern about the safety risks posed by a dirigible catching fire on top of the building, potentially endangering the population below. Nature also presented challenges, as the swiveling of the dirigible around the mooring mast could be dangerous, especially in a busy urban area like downtown New York. Overall, the obstacles of structural stress and safety risks posed significant challenges to the successful use of the mooring mast at the Empire State Building.
1025	15858	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including the need to change the structure of the building to accommodate a rocket-shaped mooring mast. This modification added extra cost and time to the completion of the building. Additionally, getting approval from experts and ensuring the safety of passengers on the dirigibles were major challenges. Designing two floors specifically for passengers and constructing a strong door to prevent swaying in strong winds were crucial tasks that had to be carefully executed. Ultimately, these obstacles were successfully overcome, and the Empire State Building became a historic landmark in New York City.
1026	15859	6	3	To address the safety concerns of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building during its construction, the builders had to consider the challenges posed by the wind currents at the top of the building. The violent wind changes at such heights could cause a dirigible to spin uncontrollably around the mooring mast, posing a significant risk to both the passengers and the structure itself. Furthermore, the use of hydrogen-filled dirigibles from other countries added an additional layer of concern, as hydrogen is highly flammable compared to the safer alternative, helium. These factors required careful planning and consideration to ensure the safety of all involved parties and the successful operation of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1027	15860	6	3	The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This unpredictable weather made it dangerous for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast of the Empire State Building. Additionally, having dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the street posed a significant safety risk. These factors combined to show that the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not practical nor safe. Ultimately, the builders faced obstacles that prevented this innovative concept from becoming a reality.
1028	15861	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempts to dock dirigibles on the mast. One major obstacle was the need for costly modifications to the building's framework, as a single cable tether would place excessive stress on the structure. Additionally, the unpredictable winds at the building's pinnacle posed a significant danger to airships trying to approach the mast, risking collisions with surrounding buildings. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock them on the Empire State Building. The highly flammable nature of dirigibles, containing hydrogen, further added to the risks involved in attempting to moor them on the building. These factors combined to prevent the successful use of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to its abandonment as a docking point for airships.
1029	15862	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the building. The height of the building and the flatness of the roof posed difficulties in designing a safe and functional mooring mast. Although they created an observation and boarding area on the 102nd floor, the use of helium as a lifting gas for dirigibles raised concerns due to its flammability. Additionally, the shifting winds and violent air currents on top of the building presented a significant obstacle to the successful operation of the mooring mast. Despite efforts to address safety concerns, the unpredictable nature of the winds remained a persistent risk, highlighting the complexities involved in creating a secure mooring system for dirigibles atop the iconic Empire State Building.
1030	15863	6	3	Intended uses for buildings often face challenges, as seen in the case of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One major obstacle encountered was the need to reinforce the entire building to construct a dock, which came at a significant cost. Additionally, the violent air currents above the building posed a challenge, causing potential swiveling of the ship during mooring. Moreover, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas presented a legal barrier to docking blimps at the iconic building. The cost of reinforcement, weather conditions, and legal restrictions were the three key hurdles in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1031	15864	6	3	The workers faced challenges when constructing a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The unpredictable winds at that height posed a significant risk, causing the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, the use of hydrogen by foreign dirigibles instead of helium presented a safety hazard due to hydrogen's flammability. These factors made it difficult for workers to determine the safety and feasibility of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.
1032	15865	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off, a major concern was that many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second, the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding dirigibles from flying too low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace. The main obstacles the builders faced were safety concerns, high winds, and the illegality of their project. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building remains an iconic symbol of New York City, standing tall and proud as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance.
1033	15866	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the frame, requiring a redesign of the entire structure to accommodate this weight. However, the mooring mast was never able to fulfill its purpose due to safety concerns that should have been considered before construction began. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, with heavy winds, rain, and heat posing potential risks to the urban area. Despite efforts to overcome these challenges, the builders ultimately struggled to create a safe and functional docking space for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1034	15867	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1035	15868	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are in many ways. In my own opinion I think the Empire State Building is familiar to different people but not many knows the purpose to serve a landing spot for dirigibles. For an example ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In conclusion that is one way how they faced the obstacles. In another way how the obstacles and builders of the Empire State Building faced to attempting to all dirigibles to dock there is by transportation. In my own opinion transportation allows people to go to one place to another, For an example ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The quote that I have just stated means that it allows passengers to go places where they want to. In conclusion, those are two examples that describe the obstacles and that allow dirigibles to dock there. Another challenge faced by the builders was the structural engineering required to support the weight and size of dirigibles, as they are significantly larger and heavier than other aircraft. Despite these difficulties, the Empire State Building eventually overcame these obstacles and successfully became a mooring mast for dirigibles, showcasing innovation and progress in the field of aviation."
1036	15869	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. One major challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Additionally, the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Furthermore, dirigibles from outside of the United States posed a risk due to their use of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. These obstacles made it difficult for the builders to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1037	15870	6	3	Based on the article, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major hindrance was the safety concern surrounding the use of hydrogen-filled dirigibles, which are highly flammable. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent winds posed a significant challenge as they could easily move the dirigibles off course. Moreover, the presence of a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. These obstacles ultimately prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its intended purpose.
1038	15871	6	3	Just like in life there are many obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention that can't be easy. So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them.
1039	15872	6	3	The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building. The construction of the Empire State Building required innovative engineering solutions to ensure its stability and safety. Additionally, the builders had to carefully design the top of the building to create a suitable landing spot for dirigibles. Through meticulous planning and execution, they successfully overcame these challenges and created an iconic landmark that continues to attract visitors from around the world.
1040	15873	6	3	While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen.
1041	15874	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. Safety was a major concern, as a hydrogen zeppelin catching fire over New York City could lead to a catastrophic city-wide fire. Additionally, the unpredictable wind patterns at such heights made docking and staying docked extremely difficult. Despite attempts by the Navy, the wind conditions proved too challenging for successful docking. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over cities, effectively putting an end to the ambitious dock plan. While the idea of a dirigible dock atop the Empire State Building was certainly impressive, the various obstacles and safety concerns ultimately rendered it impractical and unattainable.
1042	15875	6	3	The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below. However, the greatest obstacle they faced was the wind, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This presented a significant challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building as they sought to allow derigibles to dock there.
1043	15876	6	3	In addition to the lack of a suitable landing area on the roof of the Empire State Building, the builders also had to contend with the fact that airships outside the U.S. used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of the safer helium. This posed a significant risk of fire and explosion if a dirigible were to dock on top of the building. Furthermore, regulations prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, as strong winds could cause them to veer off course and potentially collide with other buildings. These obstacles presented considerable challenges for the builders in their quest to establish a mooring mast for dirigibles on the iconic skyscraper.
1044	15877	6	3	The success of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was prevented by many obstacles. Safety was a significant concern, as dirigibles from outside of the United States often used flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a risk in a densely populated city like New York. Additionally, the violent air currents on top of the building made it challenging for dirigibles to stay stable while moored to the mast. The constant shifting winds could cause the dirigible to swivel uncontrollably, creating a dangerous situation. Moreover, the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the mooring mast. These obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles.
1045	15878	6	3	Based on the exerpt, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all for nothing. They spent extra money to restruture things but there was no need. Even if they found some way to get the dirigibles to dock, it was already illegal for aircraft to fly that close to cities. The additional costs incurred and efforts made to accommodate dirigibles ultimately proved to be futile due to existing legal restrictions on aircraft proximity to urban areas. Despite the challenges faced during construction, the intended use of the dirigible docking station was rendered impractical, highlighting the unnecessary obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building.
1046	15879	6	3	Though the idea to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was seriously considered, safety and reality made it an unrealistic feat. In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold a dirigible, over $1 million worth of modifications had to be made to the framework of the building. However, safety concerns were a major obstacle. Most dirigibles used hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable, rather than helium. The owners of the Empire State building understood the danger of a dirigible fire over the densely populated city of New York. Additionally, wind was a significant factor that posed a challenge. The back of the ship could swing around if tied to the mast, and using lead weights was not a safe option above pedestrians. Existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low or close to urban areas further hindered the feasibility of the idea. Even if attempted, docking would be challenging due to forceful winds. These obstacles collectively led to the conclusion that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was no longer a viable consideration.
1047	15880	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."
1048	15881	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we are informed of the many obstacles standing in the way of landing a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle can be found in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than hellium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" As you can see the use of hydrogen would provide a great hazard to New York City as a dirigible was landing on the top of the building. It is a highly populated spot and could be potentially very dangerous. Another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph @NUM2. It stated that ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 to the wind. L¸sted informs us of the terrible hazard of the air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. All in all, many obstacles stood in the way for allowing dirigibles to dock, and in the end that is why it wasn't successful.  Despite the efforts to overcome these obstacles, the challenges posed by the use of hydrogen and the unpredictable wind currents ultimately prevented the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building. The potential danger to the city and the uncontrollable forces of nature proved to be insurmountable barriers to this ambitious endeavor."
1049	15882	6	3	The Empire State Building, standing tall as the world's tallest building, was intended to serve as a docking station for dirigibles. However, this vision was never realized due to various challenges. The strong winds at the building's peak made it unsafe for dirigibles to moor securely. Additionally, laws prohibited any airship from tying up to the building or even approaching the area. Despite these obstacles, two attempts were made by the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles to land, but both failed due to the risky conditions. Ultimately, the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose of becoming a hub for dirigibles.
1050	15883	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the added stress to the building's frame. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. This obstacle could cause the whole building structure to collapse, resulting in potential death and destruction. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These violent air currents could cause the dirigibles to lose control and collide with the building or other structures nearby. The stress being added to the Empire State building and the unpredictable nature of the winds were the two main obstacles faced by the builders.
1051	15884	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to land there. One major challenge was the need to make changes to existing plans for the building's steel frame to accommodate the landing of dirigibles. Additionally, the strong winds in the area made it difficult for dirigibles to safely land on the building. However, the most significant reason for not allowing dirigibles to land was safety concerns. Many dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, as opposed to the safer alternative, helium. This posed a major safety risk and ultimately led to the decision to prohibit dirigibles from landing at the Empire State Building.
1052	15885	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area, requiring architects to build enough space for precise landings. Another challenge was nature itself, with unpredictable violent air currents affecting dirigible landings. Al Smith's plan to allow dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was hindered by a law making it illegal for ships to approach the area. As a result, dirigibles gave way to airplanes as the preferred mode of air travel."
1053	15886	6	3	The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was that it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. Additionally, it was also against the law for them to tie up to buildings. The purpose of the dirigibles was to dock at the mast, but if they couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there, the whole concept would be rendered useless. To enable docking, the dirigibles would need to be weighted down by lead weights, but this posed a safety risk as the weights could dangle above pedestrians. This solution was deemed impractical and unsafe for those on the street below.  If the dirigibles were to dock at the top of buildings, they would be held by a single cable. However, all the pressure on the cable would put stress on the building's frame. In such a scenario, the buildings' foundations would need to be reinforced and modified to accommodate the added pressure. In hindsight, it is evident that the major obstacle faced by the builders was the lack of thorough planning for the dirigibles' docking process. Had they considered these factors beforehand, many of these obstacles could have been avoided.
1054	15887	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock there. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, as evidenced by the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in a fire caused by hydrogen in New Jersey on @DATE1. When the owners of the Empire State building learned about the severity of this incident, they were deterred. Nature posed a significant obstacle as well. Given the building's height, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents."" Moreover, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach the area."
1055	15888	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building was necessary to accommodate the docking mast for dirigibles. This required a significant change in the building's original design. Safety was a major concern, especially considering that most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen rather than safer helium. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the winds at the building's height posed a threat, as violent air currents could make docking precarious. Even when securely tied down, dirigibles would still dangle over the streets below, risking the safety of pedestrians. Balancing design modifications with safety considerations proved to be a significant obstacle for the builders in their efforts to make the Empire State Building dirigible-friendly.
1056	15889	6	3	They had to worry about the safety of the people as they docked, ensuring that the boat remained stable. They needed to carefully plan how to approach it and consider the possible outcomes if something went wrong. It was crucial to assess the conditions of the water and weather, as well as the structure of the dock itself. Any miscalculation could result in injuries or damage to the boat. Therefore, they had to proceed with caution and follow all necessary safety measures to ensure a smooth and secure docking process. By prioritizing safety and being vigilant throughout the operation, they could successfully navigate any potential risks and ensure a safe arrival for everyone on board.
1057	15890	6	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obstacles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two main aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to: structural integrity and design. Since the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof, modifications to the building's frame were necessary, costing over $1 million. The architect, John Tauranac, envisioned the mast as more than just functional, aiming for a design that was both ornamental and visually striking. This led to the construction of a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, requiring significant extra work for the builders. Despite these obstacles, the builders successfully completed the project, meeting the high aspirations set by the architect.
1058	15891	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being that the architects could not have a mooring mast on top of the building because the dirigible would be, ""... held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This would cause the building to have too weak of a frame from the dirigible's load, as well as the wind pressure. Then the stress would be transmitted down to the foundation of the building. As a result, the building's frame was modified, costing ""Over sixty thousand dollars'"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle was designing the mooring mast, so passengers could be brought, ""... down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). In order for this to be completed, builders had to complete the roof. Lastly, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). When the winds came into action at the top of the building, the dirigible would swivel around the mast. This would cause a safety hazard for pedestrians on the street. The Mooring Mast supported many reasons as to the obstacles builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, these challenges had to be carefully navigated to ensure the safety and functionality of the mooring mast for dirigibles."
1059	15892	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by @PERSON1, the author describes many obstacles builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the modifications that had to be made to the building's framework. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,"" showing how expensive this project was going to be. A second potential issue was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many complications, such as the wind blowing the dirigible onto sharp spires, a consequence feared by the pilot of Los Angeles. Another problem brought up by the shifting winds would be the ship spinning, potentially resulting in a catastrophe. They accommodated for the use with impractical things, eventually leading to the downfall of the mooring mast. These challenges highlight the complexities and risks involved in creating a docking system for dirigibles, underscoring the importance of thorough planning and consideration of all possible obstacles."
1060	15893	6	3	In addition to the safety concerns related to the flammability of hydrogen and the strong winds at the top of the Empire State Building, there were also logistical issues that would have made using the mooring mast for dirigibles unfeasible. The use of lead weights to secure the dirigibles in fields would not be practical at such a height above downtown New York. Moreover, even if these challenges were somehow overcome, there was a legal barrier prohibiting airships from flying at such low altitudes over populated areas. Considering these numerous obstacles, it was clear that the idea of using the mast for dirigibles was not a viable solution for the builders and architects of the Empire State Building.
1061	15894	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were many. The architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building that was only held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the buildings frame. To be able to handle the dirigible's load the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened, which was over sixty thousand dollars' worth. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were always shifting, which could lead to the back of the ship swiveling around and around the mooring mast. The architects had to carefully consider these challenges to ensure the safety and stability of the Empire State Building.
1062	15895	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the architects faced was the stress the cable tether would put onto the building's foundation. In paragraph @NUM1, L¸sted mentions, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" A very expensive problem to fix. Another challenge the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their was the lack of safety. Dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In paragraph @NUM2 L¸sted says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [an] accident could [be] if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The number 1 obstacle builders faced was nature itself. The violent winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. In paragraph @NUM3 L¸sted reasons. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would be neither practical nor safe. The obstacles the builders faced were too egregious, so the idea had quietly disappeared. Ultimately, the challenges of stress on the building's foundation, safety concerns with flammable gases, and the unpredictable nature of the wind made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
1063	15896	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it describes many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One example is the difference in the type of gas used in dirigibles. While most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, the United States mainly used helium, which is not flammable like hydrogen. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized the potential danger of allowing hydrogen dirigibles to dock at the building, thus avoiding a possible catastrophe. Another challenge for the builders was the unpredictable nature of the winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents. These shifting winds made it unsafe for pedestrians below, highlighting the difficulties faced in making the mooring mast operational. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered in their efforts to create a docking station for dirigibles, ultimately leading to the decision to abandon the project due to safety concerns."
1064	15897	6	3	"Marcia @CAPS1's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Nobody involved realized the building wouldn't be sturdy enough to allow a thousand-foot dirigible to be docked there. This pressure, and the wind pressure, would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation."" The Steel frame would also need to be reinforced, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Several other problems arose due to pedestrian safety issues: most foreign dirigibles used highly-flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that should the hydrogen cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose there lives @CAPS2 the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded @CAPS3, endangering countless pedestrians. @CAPS2 there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Although the Empire State Building never got to fulfill it's purpose, it is an international landmark in the heart of New York. Despite the setbacks faced by the builders, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and architectural prowess, symbolizing the spirit of innovation and perseverance in the face of challenges."
1065	15898	6	3	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders ran into obstacles that in the end prevented the whole idea from moving on. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" because of the changing winds atop the building there would be no safe way to moor a, lighter than air, dirigible on top of a high building. The wind also posed another problem because if the captain let go of the controls the dirigible might spear itself atop another pointy spire, thus leading to the other high buildings to be an obstacle. The Law of the day also became an obstacle ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" the building itself was high up but even at the top it wasn't legal for any airship to moor due to height restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State building would have sent New York spiraling upward to being in the land innovation but the obstacles were too great to surpass."
1066	15899	6	3	"There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigible the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close The second problem was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"" which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage. These precautions would have to be taken which were obstacles for The Empire State Building. Additionally, the height of the building itself posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely navigate and dock, as the structure was not originally designed to accommodate such airships. This further complicated the feasibility of utilizing the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles, highlighting the numerous obstacles that needed to be addressed in order to make the concept a reality."
1067	15900	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to dirigibles. Most foreign dirigibles still used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, which posed a significant fire hazard in the bustling streets of New York. Additionally, there were fierce and ever-changing wind currents above the building, causing the back of the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Moreover, a law was in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to tether to the building or even approach it. These factors combined made the mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe."" Despite the initial vision, the challenges presented by the use of hydrogen, wind currents, and legal restrictions ultimately made the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles unfeasible."
1068	15901	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle they faced is the safety of the passengers when the dirigibles would dock and the framework of the building wouldn't collapse. Engineers were trying to figure out a practical and safe way to moor airships to the mast without putting too much pressure on the building. Additionally, the engineers were concerned about the flammability of hydrogen, which is used in many dirigibles from outside the United States. This posed a significant risk, as hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. These challenges were just a few of the many obstacles the workers had to overcome in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1069	15902	6	3	In this excerpt, the Architects and Workers faced numerous obstacles while trying to construct a docking area on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. They had to ensure that the huge mast would not put excessive stress on the building's frame. Due to the potential stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, modifications had to be made to the steel frame to transmit the forces all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. However, it was later discovered that most dirigibles outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen, posing a significant safety risk. The tragic Hindenburg disaster in 1937 highlighted the potential catastrophic consequences if such an event were to occur above densely populated areas like downtown New York. As a result, the realization of the danger posed by hydrogen-filled dirigibles led to the abandonment of the plan to use the Empire State Building as a docking station for these airships.
1070	15903	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles. Dirigibles, also known as airships, are steel-framed balloons filled with hydrogen or helium to make them lighter than air. These airships could be maneuvered using propellers and rodders, with passengers riding in the gondola beneath the balloon.  However, mooring a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building posed significant challenges. The stress of the airship's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. This required over $1 million worth of modifications to the building's framework to accommodate the additional weight and pressure.  Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. These legal restrictions added another layer of complexity to the ambitious plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper.  In conclusion, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed unfeasible due to the structural challenges and legal limitations involved. Despite efforts to make it a reality, the obstacles proved insurmountable, highlighting the intricate considerations required for integrating new technologies with existing infrastructure.
1071	15904	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of The Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. They had to enable the dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers on or off. The dirigibles were docked using an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigibles could swing in the breeze, yet passengers could safely embark or disembark by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. These challenges had to be overcome to successfully incorporate dirigible docking facilities into The Empire State Building.
1072	15905	6	3	Al Smith, a former governor of New York, led the way in constructing the Empire State Building. This building was being constructed to be the tallest building, taller than the Chrysler Building which stood at 1,046 feet tall. In order to make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top for docking dirigibles. This idea faced many obstacles. First, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, costing a large amount of money to construct. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed. They should have considered each situation before building the mast, which cost a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer used, the Empire State Building still stood at the height of 1,454 feet, the tallest building ever built.
1073	15906	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal because of various potential problems they failed to predict. One major issue was the danger of attempting to land a dirigible on the Mooring Mast, as most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. This posed a significant risk, especially considering the tragic incident in New Jersey involving a hydrogen-filled dirigible. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building made it challenging for dirigibles to safely moor at the Empire State Building. The constantly changing winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swing around the mooring mast, posing a danger to the streets below. Furthermore, existing laws restricting how low airships could fly over urban areas would have prevented dirigibles from being able to moor at the Empire State Building. These unforeseen obstacles ultimately prevented the builders from achieving their goal of using the Mooring Mast for dirigibles at the iconic skyscraper.
1074	15907	6	3	The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal. Additionally, the height of the building posed a challenge for the airships to safely maneuver for docking. The structure of the Empire State Building, while iconic and grand, was not designed to accommodate the specific needs of dirigibles. Overall, the combination of safety concerns, regulatory restrictions, and physical limitations made it clear that docking airships at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
1075	15908	6	3	In order to overcome the challenges they faced in building the Empire State Building, the architects had to carefully consider the logistics of mooring a dirigible on top of the structure. The height of the building posed a significant obstacle, as it made it difficult for passengers to safely board and disembark from the airship. Due to the stress that the dirigible would place on the building's frame, the architects decided to postpone the installation of the landing gear until a later date. This decision was made in light of the unresolved issues surrounding mooring airships at such a height. Despite the setbacks, the builders remained determined to find a solution and ensure the safety of all passengers and visitors to the Empire State Building.
1076	15909	6	3	"There were many problems to overcome in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to overcome was the stress a thousand foot long dirigible would add to the building's frame. This was solved by spending over $1 million in modifying the building's framework. Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, as mentioned in paragraph 1. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The wind at 1,250 feet high is violent, and would swing a dirigible around too much to be safe. Ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. Those were three significant reasons the mooring mast failed. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building made it difficult for airships to safely navigate the strong winds at such heights. Furthermore, the lack of advancements in dirigible technology at the time made it challenging to securely dock and disembark passengers from the airships. Overall, these factors contributed to the ultimate failure of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
1077	15910	6	3	In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many problems. Firstly, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable and would pose a significant risk to the city and its pedestrians. Secondly, the shifting winds at the height of the Empire State Building presented a constant danger to pilots, as their dirigibles could easily get blown off course and collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles experienced this risk firsthand when it struggled to maintain control in the strong winds. Lastly, a pre-existing law would have made it illegal for a dirigible to enter the airspace around the Empire State Building, further complicating the plan. These challenges combined to make the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible and potentially dangerous.
1078	15911	6	3	It seems like a very challenging test for the architects as they strive to create a new era of transportation inspired by the pioneers. The task became even more daunting when they began designing the mooring mast and had to make adjustments to the building's skeleton. The completion of the 85th floor framing required the roof to be finished first. This project demands meticulous attention to detail and careful planning to ensure its success. The architects' dedication to honoring the past while embracing modern innovation will surely result in a groundbreaking achievement in the world of transportation.
1079	15912	6	3	During 1929 when Al Smith announced that he was going to make a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles in the way of the architects building design. Building a dock for blimps at the top of the worlds tallest building is no easy task. They should have realized previous to the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyways. The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrollable wind conditions. Unfortunately they never found a way to successfully complete this task and because of that the Empire State Building could never dock blimps.
1080	15913	6	3	In the 1930s, the concept of constructing a mooring mast for airships posed a significant challenge. Many people were skeptical about its feasibility. The first mooring mast built was as tall as the Chrysler Building, indicating its ambitious nature. Although the idea seemed plausible in theory, the practical implementation faced numerous complications. The mooring mast, intended to secure airships, encountered too many technical issues to be considered safe. Overall, the endeavor was deemed potentially hazardous due to the various problems it presented.
1081	15914	6	3	When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose. The unpredictable and turbulent winds at that height made it too dangerous and impractical for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1082	15915	6	3	"The building of the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was very poorly thought out. This is the reason why they faced so many obstacles. From the very start Al Smith never thought about the safety of the people. ""When other countries used hydrogen rather than helium this was a cause for very flammible possibilities. If this happened in New Jersey how bad would it be in a densely populated place like New York City. I could never imagine walking down the street and a lead weight being dropped on my head. In New York there was violent air currents and when the dirigibles would be tied up they would sway. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights. This was not practical or safe. The one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law. It was illegal for a airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings. In conclusion everything should have been thought out before making hype about something that was not safe, and that was illegal."
1083	15916	6	3	"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted it is easy to see the many complications with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 ft. building. For one there is the natural effect of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Strong winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere if the back wasn't able to be weighted down. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a 1000 ft. long dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The worker's then had to spend over $1 million to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal. According to ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All these safety troubles and violations would all together make the ""mooring"" an impossible feat. Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigible and the limited space on top of the building would pose a significant challenge for successful docking. In conclusion, the task of mooring a dirigible on top of a skyscraper presents numerous technical, structural, and legal obstacles that would make it extremely difficult to achieve."
1084	15917	6	3	The architects and builders faced large problems in the construction of the docking platform, even though they had not noticed them at first. The builders did not notice any major issues until after the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst. The building's owners became greatly concerned for the safety of the people inside and below the building if a blimp fell into the same situation as the Hindenburg. As a result, they had to reevaluate the structural integrity of the docking platform and make necessary adjustments to ensure the safety of all individuals involved. The tragic incident served as a wake-up call for the architects and builders, prompting them to prioritize safety measures in all future construction projects.
1085	15918	6	3	"When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast, he had no idea of the obstacles they would face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The reason this is so unsafe is that if the gas inside ever caught on fire, the entire craft would explode in flames. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was a problem because it would cause the dirigible to move all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probably tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face."
1086	15919	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. One of the obstacles was the crowded airspace they had for the dirigible. Crowded airspace can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing. The wind could also make the dirigible sway and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put a lot of tension on the building, and something could go wrong. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building made it a challenge for the workers to construct the dirigible mast at the top. This required careful planning and execution to ensure the safety of the workers and the structural integrity of the building. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building were able to overcome these challenges and create an iconic landmark that still stands tall today.
1087	15920	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they dealt with was the fact that mooring such heavy blimps would add stress to the building. In fact, 'the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.' Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.' It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area. Lastly, the strong winds would making mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents.' The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast and it just couldn't be completed.  Moreover, the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building was also hindered by the challenge of ensuring the safety of passengers and crew during the docking process. The risk of accidents during take-off and landing would have been significantly high, given the limited space available for maneuvering on the building's rooftop. Additionally, the unpredictability of weather conditions at such heights posed a considerable threat to the feasibility of dirigible docking. The combination of these factors ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the project, highlighting the complexities involved in integrating airships with urban structures.
1088	15921	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for ships to tie up to the building or approach the area. Additionally, forceful winds posed a problem, as evidenced by the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles being unable to dock due to strong gusts. The most significant obstacle, however, was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast unpredictably. Furthermore, the safety concern of having a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians added to the difficulties faced by the builders. These obstacles made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a complex and challenging endeavor."
1089	15922	6	3	In addition to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in creating a mooring mast for dirigibles, another significant obstacle was the issue of safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States typically used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, rather than helium. This posed a major safety concern, as any accident or mishap could potentially lead to a catastrophic fire on top of the building. Moreover, the constantly shifting winds on the building's rooftop presented a unique challenge. Dirigibles typically used lead weights to stabilize themselves, but this method would not be feasible at the Empire State Building, where the dirigibles would be hovering over pedestrians on the streets below. These safety considerations further complicated the already complex task of designing a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the iconic skyscraper.
1090	15923	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles were the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof, a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. Also, if they wanted to do this, it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. To reduce this, dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, but the obstacle to this is having weights dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. All these obstacles, yet these people were still able to build the Empire State building with a mooring mast. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and found innovative solutions to make the mooring mast a reality atop this iconic skyscraper.
1091	15924	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the Empire State building faced challenges in its quest to become the tallest building in the world in the @DATE2's. Governor Al Smith's vision of a mooring mast on top of the building to accommodate dirigibles was hindered by safety concerns, particularly the use of hydrogen in dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2. This highly flammable gas posed a significant risk, especially with the presence of sharp buildings in the vicinity. Additionally, the unpredictable winds and violent air currents at the top of the Empire State building presented another obstacle to the mooring mast's functionality. Despite efforts to overcome these challenges, by the late 1930s, the plan for the mooring mast had to be abandoned. The ambitious idea of a dirigible docking station atop the Empire State building ultimately succumbed to the realities of safety and nature, marking the end of this unique chapter in the building's history."
1092	15925	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, there was the problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building help by a single cable tether which would add stress to the frame of the building, all the way to its foundation. To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened. Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below. Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames. Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast. The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets. The effectiveness of these winds was shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock. During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings sharp spires. Those are several examples of what builders of the Empire State building had to face. Ultimately, these challenges made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would not be feasible due to safety concerns and structural limitations.
1093	15926	6	3	Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the building's frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you can't moor your ship there because you are flying too low. In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there, but they were afraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefore, they faced several challenges, including stress on the building's frame, the single tether for support, and legal restrictions on mooring height. Despite these hurdles, they persevered and successfully overcame the obstacles to achieve their goal.
1094	15927	6	3	"Derigibles, modernly called blimps were widely regarded in the 1930s as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was. These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passengers both efficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular, modern-day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel, and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable,"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as airspace restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many obstacles stood in its path to glory. The integration of dirigible mooring masts into city skyscrapers was a vision ahead of its time, hindered by practical challenges and safety concerns that ultimately prevented its realization."
1095	15928	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were extremely challenging to overcome. One significant challenge was ensuring that the building could withstand the stress of dirigibles tied to it, swaying back and forth in the wind. Additionally, the building's height posed a problem, as it was too low for dirigibles to safely navigate among the surrounding buildings. Moreover, the flammable gases inside dirigibles presented a serious safety concern, as any mishap could lead to devastation for the people below in New York City. These obstacles required innovative solutions and careful planning to address, making the task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building a complex and daunting endeavor.
1096	15929	6	3	The Empire State Building owners realized the potential danger of a dirigible accident in densely populated areas, like downtown New York, after the Hindenburg disaster. Dirigibles had impressive capabilities, such as cruising for thousands of miles without refueling, at speeds of up to eighty miles per hour. Some were as long as four city blocks, making them a significant presence in New York City. However, the lack of a suitable landing area was the main hindrance to their expanded use in the city. The destruction of the Hindenburg highlighted the importance of safety considerations when operating these massive airships above urban areas.
1097	15930	6	3	"In the @DATE1's Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's mooring system ran into many problems. One obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds caused the dirigible's tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offs. Another obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This was feared because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York, the damage would have been catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and had a crash occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and caused a tremendous amount of casualties.  Additionally, the construction of the dirigible dock was hindered by the sheer height of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast was located at a dizzying height of 1,250 feet, making it a challenging task for airships to safely dock and undock. Furthermore, the logistics of maneuvering a massive dirigible in such a congested urban area like New York posed a significant challenge for the engineers and pilots involved. Despite these obstacles, the dream of establishing the world's largest dirigible dock in New York was a bold and ambitious vision that ultimately had to be reconsidered and reevaluated due to the numerous challenges faced during the construction process."
1098	15931	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Constructed in the 1930s the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project. Most of these issues were safety problems. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low to urban areas Another reason was the flammibility of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed. In summation, because of safety risks, the mast of the Empire State Building could and was never used for its original purpose. The safety concerns surrounding the use of hydrogen-filled dirigibles ultimately prevented the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building from being utilized as intended, highlighting the importance of considering safety in architectural and aviation endeavors."
1099	15932	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building included the lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles, making it challenging to dock them safely. Additionally, the unpredictable wind and weather conditions posed a significant risk during landing attempts. To address these challenges, an electric winch was used to dock the dirigibles by pulling in a line from the front of the ship and tying it to the mast. However, if the wind interfered with the winch, it could make landing dangerous. Moreover, the builders had to incur expenses exceeding sixty thousand dollars to modify the building's framework to accommodate dirigible landings. This financial burden added another layer of difficulty for the project. Overall, the combination of these obstacles made the construction and operation of the dirigible docking system at the Empire State Building a complex and costly endeavor.
1100	15933	6	3	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it. The safety concerns related to using hydrogen and the unpredictable wind currents at high altitudes were major factors that led the builders to abandon their idea of implementing dirigibles in a densely populated city like New York.
1101	15934	6	3	The obstacles faced by the architects of the Empire State Building were formidable. In addition to the challenge of figuring out how to get dirigibles to land on the mooring mast, they also had to deal with a government that was growing impatient. Adding to their difficulties was the deceitful behavior of Al Smith, who misled others about the actual height of the building and the steps being taken to address issues with the mooring mast. The fear of a dirigible exploding on the mast, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, further complicated matters. As a result, the architects decided to temporarily set aside the mooring mast project and instead create the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the enjoyment of visitors.
1102	15935	6	3	One problem that the builders faced was ensuring the mast was large enough to support the dirigible. Some dirigibles could reach lengths of over a thousand feet, posing a challenge in terms of structural support. Simply dropping a mast on top of the Empire State Building was not a viable solution, as the stress from a dirigible tethered to the building by a single cable would be immense. This would not only strain the building's frame but also exert significant pressure on its foundation, located nearly eleven hundred feet below ground level. The designers had to carefully evaluate various factors, including the wind conditions at the building's pinnacle, which were known to be turbulent and constantly changing. Moreover, the safety of pedestrians had to be taken into account, as a dirigible hovering above them posed a significant risk. Therefore, it was crucial for the builders to develop a mast design that could withstand the weight of the dirigible, the forces of the wind, and ensure the safety of both the building and the people below.
1103	15936	6	3	There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Firstly, the powerful and constantly changing air currents at the top of the building made it impractical and unsafe for a dirigible to be tied to the mast. Secondly, existing laws prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, including downtown New York where the Empire State Building is located. Lastly, the highly flammable nature of dirigibles using hydrogen gas as fuel posed a significant risk of fire, especially in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Due to these obstacles, the builders were unable to overcome the challenges of allowing dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast, ultimately preventing it from becoming a feasible option.
1104	15937	6	3	In addition to safety concerns, another obstacle faced by the architects of the Empire State Building was the unpredictable nature of the winds at the building's pinnacle. These violent air currents made it challenging for dirigibles to dock safely, as they would swivel around the mooring mast even when tethered. Moreover, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas presented a legal barrier to dirigibles approaching or tying up to the building. The advancement of airplanes as a primary mode of aeronautical transportation also posed a challenge to the practicality of dirigibles utilizing the mooring mast. Despite efforts to establish the Empire State Building as a national landmark, these obstacles ultimately prevented the mooring mast from realizing its full potential in facilitating airship docking.
1105	15938	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon l¸sted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the challenges posed by the composition of dirigibles, the structural limitations of the Empire State Building, and the unpredictable weather conditions made it impossible to establish a safe and functional mooring mast for dirigibles on the iconic skyscraper."
1106	15939	6	3	Work faced many problems with building docks for dirigibles to land on docks attached to the Empire State Building. In paragraph 1, it states that dirigibles disappeared and did not become the transportation of the future. The Empire State Building never got to fulfill its purposes for dirigibles. Despite the initial plans and efforts made to accommodate dirigibles, the changing trends and advancements in transportation led to the eventual abandonment of this idea. Consequently, the Empire State Building's docks for dirigibles remained unused and served as a reminder of the ambitious but unfulfilled vision of incorporating air travel into the iconic structure.
1107	15940	6	3	When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places populated as New York City. Another obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose. Despite the initial enthusiasm and competition surrounding the project, the safety concerns, wind challenges, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the mast from becoming a successful docking point for dirigibles in New York City.
1108	15941	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the need to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to accommodate the mooring mast. Additionally, the architect decided against a utilitarian mast, instead opting for a design that featured shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. This tower would be illuminated from the inside and have a stepped-back design that mirrored the overall shape of the building. Despite these challenges, the architect's innovative design ultimately transformed the Empire State Building into an iconic symbol of New York City, showcasing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.
1109	15942	6	3	"Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the constructor of the entire building, was determined to surpass the height of other structures. In a surprising move, he secretly installed a 185-foot spire inside the building and later hoisted it to the top, surpassing the Chrysler Building. However, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building presented challenges due to the stress it would place on the building's frame with only a single cable tether holding them in place. Safety concerns arose as many dirigibles outside the U.S. used flammable hydrogen instead of helium, posing a significant risk of potential destruction to New York City. These factors combined to create significant hurdles for the builders as they sought to accommodate dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building, emphasizing the complexity and risks involved in the project."
1110	15943	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced challenges in completing the landing dock for dirigibles. The frame needed reinforcement to support the dirigibles, and an anchor was added at the top of the building. However, the violent winds and nearby buildings made docking difficult. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Despite attempts, no dirigible has successfully docked on top of the Empire State building to this day.
1111	15944	6	3	The Empire State Building's iconic tower was originally designed as a mooring mast for dirigibles, with the vision of revolutionizing air travel in New York City. However, this innovative idea was never put into practice due to various safety concerns. Most international dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, posing a significant risk if a fire were to break out over the densely populated city. Additionally, the unpredictable winds at such heights would make docking and maneuvering the blimps a hazardous task. Furthermore, legal restrictions on airships flying low over urban areas would have made it illegal for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Despite these obstacles, the building remains a remarkable architectural achievement in New York City's skyline.
1112	15945	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. In addition to the structural changes required to support the docking, the flammability of hydrogen used in most dirigibles posed a significant safety risk in the densely populated urban area. Moreover, the unpredictable and violent air currents at the building's height made docking extremely hazardous for both pedestrians below and passengers on the airship. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, these challenges made it impossible to implement dirigible docking at the iconic skyscraper.
1113	15946	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced several obstacles in their quest to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. One major concern was the safety of passengers boarding and disembarking, as well as those on the ground below. This was particularly worrisome because dirigibles often used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of the safer option, helium. The risk of an explosion was a significant worry.  Additionally, existing laws restricted airships from flying too low over urban areas, adding another layer of complexity to the project. The length of the dirigible, which could be as long as several hundred feet, made docking a challenge, especially with the constantly shifting wind currents. The back of the dirigible, where it was not securely fastened, could circle around the mooring mast due to these winds, posing a safety hazard.  Another obstacle was the competitive nature of the individuals involved in the project. Jealousy played a role, as one man felt threatened by his rival, Al Smith, who was gaining ground in the field before the idea of dirigible docking came into play. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to make dirigible docking a reality atop the iconic Empire State Building."
1114	15947	6	3	"Base on the excerpt the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They not going to do it because it might hit other building or fly into other self. ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" They had to consider the safety of the dirigibles and the surrounding buildings. The forceful winds made it too risky for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. This obstacle posed a significant challenge for the builders, ultimately leading to the decision not to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper."
1115	15948	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was figuring a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. Practicity and safety were an obstacle because the builders of the Empire State building were the first to attempt a docking dirigibles on air, @CAPS1 they had no past trials to refer to. In this project practicity and safety worked together. For example ""..engineers [had] to dope out a practical, workable arrangement..."" @CAPS1 that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and secure. This would assure the passengers safety as well as stability to the building.The second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" @CAPS2 all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation ""... was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation ""the steelframe [of the building had] to be modified and strengthened..."" The modification to the buildings framework was worth ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles in their building. Despite the challenges, they were able to overcome them through innovative engineering solutions, showcasing the pioneering spirit of the time."
1116	15949	6	3	"Al Smith and other workers are working on Empire State Building. They been having a few obstales with the project like they can't have it has high as they wanted it. They had to fix the mast skeleton if they wanted to do more. The Dirigibles for example. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on @DATE1. This explains they had gotten a law after this from happening so they can't have things near the Urban areas. This proves that there were challenges with Empire State building that they worked around. The safety regulations put in place after the Hindenburg disaster greatly influenced the construction of the Empire State Building, ensuring that it adhered to strict guidelines to prevent similar tragedies. Despite the setbacks, the workers persevered and successfully completed the iconic skyscraper, demonstrating their resilience and commitment to creating a safe and remarkable structure."
1117	15950	6	3	Additionally, the use of hydrogen in the dirigible posed a significant safety risk due to its highly flammable nature. Any ignition source near the mooring mast could potentially result in a catastrophic fire or explosion. This further emphasized the impracticality and dangers associated with the original plans for the Empire State Building's mooring mast. Ultimately, these obstacles and risks led to the decision to abandon the idea of a dirigible docking station on the iconic skyscraper.
1118	15951	6	3	They were many obstacles the @ORGANIZATION2 of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was the stress of the dirigibles's load and the wind pressure didn't allow to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, in which was nearly @NUM1 feet below. Another things that was an obstancle for the @ORGANIZATION2 was it was alot of money it was over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. The last obstacle was it safety. Most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States uses hydrogen rather then helim, which hydrogen is highly flamable. This let to a accident on May 6, 1937, the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it happened in dowtown New York. This are some obtecles the @ORGANIZATION2 of @ORGANIZATION2 faced. Additionally, the location of the Empire State Building in a densely populated area added to the safety concerns, as any mishap involving a dirigible could have catastrophic consequences on the surrounding buildings and residents. The structural modifications required for the docking of dirigibles also posed a significant financial burden on the @ORGANIZATION2, further complicating the project. Despite these challenges, the @ORGANIZATION2 persisted in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles, showcasing their determination and innovative spirit in the face of adversity.
1119	15952	6	3	In The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for airships, as it was difficult for them to maintain a stable connection in such high altitudes. Despite these obstacles, the architects and engineers continued to explore innovative solutions to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality. Ultimately, the challenges faced in accommodating airships at the building highlighted the complexities involved in integrating aviation with urban infrastructure.
1120	15953	6	3	There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City for the expanded use of dirigibles. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, rather than helium. These challenges ultimately contributed to the lack of success in establishing dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1121	15954	6	3	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith made a groundbreaking announcement regarding the construction of the Empire State Building in New York, which would stand as the world's tallest building at 1,250 feet. The plan included a dirigible mooring mast, intended to facilitate the docking of airships. However, several obstacles arose during the building process that hindered the successful implementation of this feature. One major challenge was the impact of strong winds on the stability of the dirigibles, causing them to sway uncontrollably when attempting to dock. Additionally, the presence of foreign dirigibles filled with flammable gases posed a significant safety risk if moored too close to the densely populated urban area surrounding the building. To address these concerns, the constructors had to invest additional time and resources into reinforcing the structure of the building to ensure it could safely accommodate the dirigibles. Despite the ambitious vision of incorporating a dirigible mooring mast, these obstacles ultimately prevented its practical use.
1122	15955	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the building's framework. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes. With all these challenges in mind, the grand vision of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned, paving the way for airplanes to dominate the future of transportation.
1123	15956	6	3	"When the architects first looked at creating a safe landing zone for the dirigibles they overlooked several key factors. The Empire State building is over 1,400 feet tall, and at those heights, the winds become very powerful and would blow the dirigible all over the place. This was proved in paragraph 2. The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast, although they had a skillful pilot, he could not get the steel-framed balloon close enough to dock on the spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh into the equation was that most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on fire, then that would be one massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York. The ""Hindenburg"" gave us the example which was all we needed to see to change our mind about wanting a massive flammable balloon hovering over the streets of New York City."
1124	15957	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire over a density populated area like New York, there could have been a huge accident. One of the greatest obstacles, however, was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds. By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered impractical and unsafe. Due to mother nature and safety reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Additionally, the sheer height of the building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely approach and dock, as the altitude and the structure itself created turbulence and unpredictable conditions for airships. Despite the initial vision of utilizing the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles, the practical limitations presented by nature and safety concerns ultimately led to the abandonment of this ambitious idea."
1125	15958	6	3	New York City was the lack of a suitable Landing space, the winds pushing the dirigible around, and the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the Empire builders. These challenges made it difficult for them to navigate and operate their airships effectively in the city. Despite these hurdles, the Empire builders persevered and found ways to overcome these obstacles in order to continue their mission of expanding their influence and dominance. Through strategic planning and innovative solutions, they were able to adapt to the environment and regulations, ultimately achieving their goals in the face of adversity.
1126	15959	6	3	"The builders and engineers faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building. The building's height, weight, and wind pressure required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to its framework. Additionally, the use of flammable hydrogen by most international blimps posed a significant safety risk in the densely populated downtown New York location. Shifting winds and laws against low-flying airships further complicated the feasibility of the project. Despite attempts by the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia,"" the intense winds and nearby buildings' sharp spires proved too challenging for successful landings. Ultimately, the project exemplified a well-intentioned idea that was nearly impossible to execute due to various practical constraints."
1127	15960	6	3	Based on the excerpt, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a risky decision. The potential dangers and risks involved in such operations could have led to disastrous consequences. While it may have seemed like the only option at the time due to the limitations of technology, looking back, it is clear that it was not a safe choice. The use of balloons may have been a safer alternative, considering the potential hazards that could arise from attempting to dock dirigibles at such a busy and crowded location. In hindsight, it is evident that the risks outweighed the benefits in this situation.
1128	15961	6	3	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author states that nature posed one of the biggest challenges for the mooring mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The author explains that the wind conditions on top of the buildings were hazardous for the dirigibles. ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Furthermore, the author describes how the wind could cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast even if it was tethered. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" These factors presented significant challenges for the safe docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1129	15962	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building taller, more ornamental, and to put in a pyramid at the top, which exhausted the workers. The architects and builders consulted with experts and took tours of the equipment and mooring operations. However, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The lack of a suitable landing area in New York City also hindered their efforts.
1130	15963	6	3	"This project towards ""transportation of the future"" for the Empire State Building was no easy task. One of the major obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame"". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to accommodate the dirigibles. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked. Allowing these giant aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was ""neither practical nor safe. These obstacles caused the workers and architects to postpone the build.  To overcome these challenges, the team had to carefully consider the structural integrity of the building and find innovative solutions to ensure the safety of both the dirigibles and the pedestrians below. By making the necessary modifications and adjustments, they were able to create a safe and functional mooring mast that could accommodate the transportation of the future. Despite the setbacks, the project ultimately succeeded in transforming the Empire State Building into a hub for air travel, showcasing the ingenuity and determination of the team involved."
1131	15964	6	3	Another challenge faced in implementing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was the issue of fire hazards. Blimps were filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas, posing a significant risk if they were to catch fire while docked on the building. The potential danger to the building and surrounding areas was deemed too great to proceed with the original plan. Additionally, the advancements in airplane technology made dirigibles less popular for air travel, further diminishing the need for a mooring mast in the city. Despite the initial vision, the Empire State Building ultimately became an iconic skyscraper known for its architectural grandeur rather than a docking station for airships.
1132	15965	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to obstruct dirigibles to dock on the top of their building. They faced obstacles like laws, safety problems, and also natural problems when trying to succeed in this gutsy idea. They first faced the problem of law, with an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed an obstacle for the builders because they would have to dock the blimp without flying in this restricted fly zone. The second problem was dealing with safety, especially after the Hindenburg disaster. Owners of the Empire State Building realized the potential danger of a similar accident over downtown New York. Finally, the builders faced problems with nature when the dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. The builders realized that the drastic changes in wind patterns at the top of the building were not suitable for a blimp. These designers had more than a mundane idea but it was shot down with the multiple obstacles that arose.
1133	15966	6	3	The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The winds on the top of the building were consistently shifting due to the violent air currents. These were just a couple of the challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome during its construction. The safety and stability of the structure were of utmost importance, considering the potential dangers posed by the unpredictable elements. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic skyscraper, which stands as a testament to human ingenuity and determination.
1134	15967	6	3	The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the safety of everyone involved, including those on the dirigible, pedestrians on the streets below, and occupants inside the building. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of winds at the top of tall buildings posed a significant problem for landing dirigibles. The need to counterbalance the dirigibles with lead weights further complicated the situation, potentially endangering those below. Ultimately, these safety concerns and the technical difficulties of navigating changing wind patterns prevented the completion of the dirigible dock on the Empire State Building.
1135	15968	6	3	"There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" These are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to alow dirigibles to dock there. The structural integrity of the building had to be carefully considered in order to safely incorporate dirigibles, which would require significant modifications and reinforcement to the existing steel framework. Ultimately, the challenges posed by these obstacles proved to be insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1136	15969	6	3	"The idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place. When these dirigibles would try to dock to this building, the structure of the building wouldn't be able to handle the violent winds and the zeppelin. It caused many problems. What if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew it's tail end around to hit a building. The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this occurred in such a heavily populated place, it would be chaos. Impractical and unsafe, this plan wouldn't work. They would need something more stable. The plans of this weren't completely thought through. All these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear. These plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel. The potential risks and impracticalities associated with docking dirigibles to buildings, as highlighted by historical disasters like the Hindenburg, underscore the need for more stable and thought-out transportation solutions. Ultimately, the challenges and safety concerns involved in implementing such a plan make airplanes a more viable and efficient mode of travel for the future."
1137	15970	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there. Additionally, the structural limitations of the building and the lack of proper facilities for docking also played a significant role in making it unfeasible for dirigibles to operate from the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the various safety concerns, weather challenges, and legal restrictions made it clear that utilizing dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a practical or viable option.
1138	15971	6	3	"The idea of the dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was very smart and could've been great. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when trying to achieve that goal. One problem was the wind forces were too strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (∂ @NUM1). Another reason is the safety of the people. Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take into consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (∂ @NUM3). The docking at the Empire State Building was a great idea but there were too many challenges that faced the builders. Ultimately, despite the innovative concept, the practical issues surrounding wind forces, safety concerns regarding hydrogen gas, and legal restrictions on aircraft near urban areas made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building's mooring mast unfeasible."
1139	15972	6	3	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. So the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the ship and then tied it to a mast so by swinging the body the passengers could safely get on and off. This innovative idea would not only provide a solution to the landing issue but also bring a touch of futuristic elegance to the iconic Empire State Building, making it a hub for air travel in the heart of the city.
1140	15973	6	3	The problems that the workers faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were crucial. If they attempted to put a mooring mast on the rooftop, the structure would not be able to withstand the weight of a thousand-pound dirigible. The stress of the dirigible's weight and wind pressure would need to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was 1,100 feet below. The building's frame would have to be significantly modified and strengthened, which would be costly. Additionally, the winds posed a significant challenge, and if the dirigible landed, weights would be needed to secure it. However, this would create a safety hazard as the dirigible would dangle high above pedestrians. Overall, the difficulties faced by the workers in docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building were primarily due to structural limitations, financial constraints, and safety concerns.
1141	15974	6	3	The obstacles faced during the construction of the Empire State Building were significant. Architects encountered challenges such as the building not being designed to support additional structures like a mooring mast. The wind also posed a threat, as attaching a dirigible to the building could put stress on its frame. Safety concerns arose as well, with the potential for accidents and injuries if the dirigible were to be built. Nature also played a role, with the possibility of fierce winds causing the dirigible to come crashing down. These obstacles required careful planning and modifications to ensure the safety and stability of the Empire State Building. Despite these challenges, the iconic skyscraper was successfully completed, standing as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of adversity.
1142	15975	6	3	Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible, they needed to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the structure of the building. Additionally, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a rocket-shaped mast of shiny aluminum, which also housed elevators and stairs. However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around erratically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities due to safety hazards, as they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building as a dock unrealistic. Ultimately, the challenges of accommodating dirigibles on the Empire State Building proved too significant to overcome, leading to the impracticality of using the building as a docking station for blimps.
1143	15976	6	3	In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. At first, Al Smith wanted this newly designed building to be the tallest one in the world. Now, this 1,250-foot building would reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing dirigibles to dock there. Passengers could get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refueling its engine. However, there were issues that the constructors did not foresee. The thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, and the wind would cause thousands of dollars in damage. To prevent any harm to the building or residents of New York, the steel frame of the Empire State building had to be strengthened, costing the city over $1 million. This investment aimed to put New York on the map for modern travel and ensure the safety of the iconic structure.
1144	15977	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were lack of area, populated area, and the flammability of hydrogen. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were enormous steel-framed balloons filled with hydrogen or helium to make them lighter than air. However, hydrogen is highly flammable, as demonstrated by the destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This incident highlighted the dangers of allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building, which is located in a populated area. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over populated areas, further complicating the possibility of dirigibles docking at the building. Overall, these factors combined to make it too risky to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1145	15978	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to collaborate with the navy and other experts to devise a safe and practical plan that wouldn't compromise the building's structural integrity or require excessive funds for reinforcement. The plan they developed detailed the materials the mast would be constructed from and the layout of each floor, with the roof needing completion before the mooring mast could be implemented.  However, the most significant obstacle they encountered was one they hadn't anticipated initially - the challenges posed by nature. The builders realized that factors like strong winds, violent air currents, and the risk of potential fires made the project too unsafe to proceed with. Additionally, a law prohibiting airships from flying at low altitudes further complicated the situation. Despite their efforts, the obstacles proved insurmountable, and ultimately, the mooring mast was never constructed."
1146	15979	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders were numerous. One challenge they encountered was uncertainty about whether they even wanted to construct the tower. Additionally, a significant hurdle was the prevalence of hydrogen usage in dirigibles from outside the United States, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Moreover, nature itself posed a formidable obstacle in the form of the mooring mast. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to overcome these obstacles and complete the construction of the tower.
1147	15980	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, builders of the Empire State building faced many problems. Their first problem was; ""[t]he architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of... the flat roof"". The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State building. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flammable, making it highly dangerous to moor over a populated New York City. Also, nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were so strong that it would be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. The mooring mast atop the Empire State building was a good idea but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely, and against the law. Therefore, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State building in constructing a mooring mast were significant and ultimately rendered the idea unfeasible."
1148	15981	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The second obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle they faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM3). This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Furthermore, the safety concerns surrounding dirigibles docking in a heavily populated urban area would have posed significant challenges for the Empire State Building's operation. Ultimately, despite the initial vision of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building, these obstacles proved too difficult to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the idea."
1149	15982	6	3	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the world and was intended to serve as a passenger exchange and refueling dock for dirigibles. However, due to complications in architectural design, the planned mooring mast was never built. The architects realized that modifications would be necessary to accommodate the added stress from the mast, and the building's height would need to be increased. Despite these changes, safety concerns ultimately led to the decision not to construct the mast. The highly flammable hydrogen used to power dirigibles posed a significant risk to the city of New York. Additionally, the strong winds at such a high altitude would have made it challenging for dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated. Ultimately, the obstacles presented by nature and safety considerations prevented the mooring mast from being realized on the Empire State Building.
1150	15983	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The stress of wind pressure and the dirigible's weight needed to be carefully managed to ensure the building's structural integrity. Safety concerns were paramount, especially considering the flammability of hydrogen used in most dirigibles outside the United States. A potential fire above a densely populated area could result in a catastrophic event. However, the unpredictable nature of the wind posed the greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast. The constantly shifting winds and violent air currents above the Empire State Building made it difficult for dirigibles to safely land, even if tethered to the mooring mast. Nature, with its uncontrollable elements, proved to be a formidable challenge in the realization of this ambitious docking system.
1151	15984	6	3	The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles were immense. Not only did they have to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building, but they also had to reconstruct the entire structure to support the mooring mast. Working at a height of 1,250 feet, the workers had to raise the American flag at the top of the frame, symbolizing their dedication and perseverance in the face of adversity. Despite the hardships they faced, the builders successfully overcame the obstacles and achieved their goal of making the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible docking.
1152	15985	6	3	Obstacles the builders faced with the Empire State Building included the lack of technology to land a dirigible on the mooring mast. In February 1931, @CAPS1 Clavan from the building's architectural office noted that the unresolved issues of mooring airships at such a height led to the decision to delay the installation of the landing gear. By the late 1930s, dirigibles had been replaced by airplanes as the preferred mode of transportation. To address the challenges, builders had to construct an electric winch and gang plank. The electric winch was used to haul in a line from the front of the ship and tie it to the mast, while the gang plank provided access to an open observation platform. These solutions helped overcome the obstacles and ensure the successful completion of the Empire State Building.
1153	15986	6	3	"It was once said ""were there is a will there is a way"". However, they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance how the was a will & way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen. Also, the wind currents have a stronger force high up in the air than to regular life level. Also, the un-ideal place they were trying to use. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""location, location, location."""
1154	15987	6	3	"At sporting events, people have gotten used to seeing the @CAPS1 blimp or the Goodyear blimp. Now they are used for advertising but not many people know that they were once thought of as transportation. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, shows not only the original purpose for the mast of the Empire State building was for mooring blimps, but also shows the many problems faced with blimp travel. Safety was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pushing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it. Al Smith had a good idea for the Empire State Building's mast, however there were too many problems to make it a reality. Additionally, the technology of the time was not advanced enough to provide a safe and efficient means of mooring blimps at such heights. Overall, the challenges and risks associated with dirigible travel ultimately prevented the idea from being implemented successfully."
1155	15988	6	3	Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The addition of the mooring mast was a complex process that required careful planning and execution to ensure its structural integrity and functionality. Despite the challenges faced by the builders, the Empire State Building's mooring mast ultimately became a symbol of innovation and progress in the field of architecture.
1156	15989	6	3	The builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, this added stress to the building's frame. The stress of the blimp's load plus wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened to accommodate this. This required careful planning and engineering to ensure the safety and stability of the structure. Despite the challenges, the builders were able to overcome these obstacles and successfully create a mooring mast for dirigibles on the iconic Empire State Building.
1157	15990	6	3	They had to build the tower just right or else there would be landing problems if they added the sightseeing thing. People would pay any price, but the cost of keeping it stable was not worth the effort. In the end, the people were determined to make this a very popular attraction, but external factors like wind and landing issues always stood in their way. Despite the challenges, they invested a significant amount of money to stabilize the building. This endeavor turned out to be a profitable venture and provided an exhilarating ride of a lifetime for visitors.
1158	15991	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles the builders faced to have the dirigibles be able to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle the builders faced was figuring out how to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State building to accommodate the mooring mast on top of the building. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a lot of money back in the 1930s. Once the builders finished framing the entire building, the greatest obstacle to constructing the mooring mast came to be. This obstacle was nature itself. Violent air currents would have the back of the blimps swivel around and around the mast. The blimp would need weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street and this was neither practical nor safe. Another issue was that the high altitude winds at the top of the building were much stronger than originally anticipated, making it even more challenging to secure the dirigibles. Despite these obstacles, the builders eventually found a solution by using a cone-shaped windbreak on top of the mooring mast to deflect the winds and allow for safe docking of the dirigibles. This innovative solution ultimately allowed the Empire State Building to become a landmark in aviation history as well as in architectural achievement.
1159	15992	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were hailed as the transportation of the future, but in New York City, there was a lack of a suitable landing area. The speed at which dirigibles traveled and the area's wind speed and heights became concerning. The dirigible plan became increasingly unreasonable, especially after an accident occurred in @LOCATION2. Due to the height, wind speed, and location, using dirigibles was no longer a viable option.
1160	15993	6	3	"In ""The mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced was having to try and make it perfect, especially for the designers. They went through a lot of work, effort, and time. They tried to make different arrangements for the government people. The dirigibles were always near the mooring mast. They were afraid that it would knock over one day. They also, wanted them to become the transportation of the future. The transportation was to the airplanes. The dirigibles became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. So, their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay.  The builders faced challenges in ensuring the safety and functionality of the mooring mast, aiming to cater to the needs of the government officials. Despite efforts to make dirigibles the future of transportation, they ended up serving as attractions for sightseers, like a soda fountain and tea garden. Despite not going entirely according to plan, the overall outcome was acceptable."
1161	15994	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to figure a way around. The architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building. Soon enough, problems evolved that could not be fixed. An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these problems, the architects never added the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew that it would not be used as it was intended to. Despite their initial vision, the challenges and regulations surrounding dirigibles made it unfeasible to utilize the mooring mast at the Empire State Building for its intended purpose.
1162	15995	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building in New York City. One obstacle they encountered was figuring out how to attach the mooring mast securely to the building. Additionally, they had to strengthen and modify the building to handle the added stress of a dirigible docking on top. The stress and wind pressure from a thousand-foot dirigible could potentially cause the building to collapse if not properly addressed. Therefore, the architects had to ensure that the stress of the dirigible's load could be safely transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. These challenges required careful planning and engineering to overcome in order to successfully implement the mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
1163	15996	6	3	The consequences of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been significant. Regular-sized dirigibles were enormous steel-framed balloons capable of reaching speeds of up to eighty miles per hour, with a cruising speed of seventy miles per hour. However, the idea of a dirigible docking at the building, high above the streets, was deemed impractical and unsafe. Furthermore, even if a dirigible were to land there, the swiveling motion of the ship would have posed a risk to the stability of the building. Additionally, it was illegal for any ship to tie up at the building or even approach the area. The challenges and risks involved in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have far outweighed any potential benefits, making it an unfeasible endeavor.
1164	15997	6	3	Other than making amendments to building plans, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing an extreme safety hazard above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Additionally, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult and dangerous to weigh down docking dirigibles. Moreover, the building plans for the Empire State Building did not correspond to existing laws, as regulations prohibited airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas, making the use of the mooring mast illegal. Before the builders could complete the Empire State Building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles to ensure the safety and legality of their construction project.
1165	15998	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Originally, the greatest problem builders faced was strengthening the building's foundational base in order to support the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. To combat this, modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not considered until after it was built. A most important one was safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles to use helium to float which is highly flammable. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster over New York City is too dangerous to risk. Another preventer of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights due to the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that face the builders of the Empire State building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, eventually led to the dropping of the idea all together. However, despite the challenges faced, the Empire State Building remains an iconic landmark in New York City, symbolizing the innovation and determination of its builders.
1166	15999	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges in its attempt to accommodate dirigibles due to safety concerns and legal restrictions. The use of hydrogen in most foreign dirigibles posed a significant fire hazard, as demonstrated by the tragic Hindenburg disaster in 1937. The unpredictable winds at the top of the building made docking difficult, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to approach or tether to the building. Despite these obstacles, two dirigibles attempted to reach the Empire State Building before the idea was ultimately abandoned. Overall, the risks and regulatory barriers associated with dirigible docking made it impractical for the iconic skyscraper.
1167	16000	6	3	In addition to the safety concerns related to the flammability of hydrogen-filled dirigibles, the strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building presented another significant obstacle. These wind currents caused the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, making it difficult for them to dock securely. This swiveling not only posed a risk to the dirigibles themselves but also increased the likelihood of a collision with other buildings in the area. To mitigate this issue, controllers would have had to use lead weights to weigh down the dirigibles, but this solution raised its own set of safety concerns. The presence of lead weights hanging above pedestrians on the street created a potential hazard, as any accidental dislodging could prove fatal. Furthermore, even if these obstacles were somehow overcome, mooring a dirigible at the Empire State Building would have violated existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Ultimately, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to remain unused, as the numerous obstacles and safety risks associated with docking dirigibles made it an impractical and illegal endeavor. The builders of the Empire State Building should have conducted more thorough research and planning before embarking on this ambitious but ultimately futile project.
1168	16001	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. One major problem arose when they realized the force of holding the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. @NUM1). This meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device. Once the mast and reconstruction work completed, builders realize that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. @NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. Attempts to moor became even more difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. @NUM3). This shows how builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project caused builders to struggle with the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, before ultimately abandoning the mast. Despite their best efforts, the challenges they faced ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the decision to forgo the ambitious mooring mast project."
1169	16002	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders were significant, particularly due to the extreme height of the building. Special gear was necessary for the construction work, adding to the complexity and difficulty of the task. Al Smith had to carefully consider the safety implications before proceeding with the construction of the mast, highlighting the potential dangers involved. The financial aspect was also a challenge, with over sixty thousand dollars required for the building framework alone. Other obstacles included logistical challenges such as allowing passengers to board and ensuring the availability of sufficient fuel for dirigibles. Despite these difficulties, the builders persevered in their efforts to make the building bigger and more functional.
1170	16003	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock. The first was that they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building, it would have put too much stress on the buildings frame. They had to transmite the stress all the way down to the foundation of the building. They did over $1 million worth of framework to the building. Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which was impossible. First off the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent ever-changing winds were too much to control the ship in. But even if they did dock the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast. Another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas. So now the ships couldn't ever approach the building to tie off to the mast. The challenges faced by the builders were substantial, from structural limitations to legal restrictions. Despite their efforts, the feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building seemed increasingly unlikely.
1171	16004	6	3	"Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not considered in the beginning, the builders of the Empire State building faced these obstacles eventually. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a large problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" when a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it hard to hold the dirigible steady, it made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangling weights above @CAPS2 ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimps (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the @LOCATION4 from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation."
1172	16005	6	3	In the @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety, most dirigibles who were coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. Another obstacle was just nature itself. Winds were constantly shifting caused by violent air currents. Another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders should have realized all the hazards they were facing, and just dropped the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock and disembark passengers. The unpredictable weather patterns in New York City further complicated the feasibility of using the mooring mast for airships. Furthermore, the lack of technological advancements in dirigible safety measures at the time made it even riskier to attempt to use the mast for air travel. In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in utilizing the mooring mast for dirigibles were significant and ultimately led to the abandonment of this ambitious idea.
1173	16006	6	3	In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands 1,250 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak. The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at 1,472 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put $250,000 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building. An important downfall about the dirigibles is that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives. I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today.  While the concept of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building may have been innovative for its time, the potential risks and dangers associated with docking dirigibles, especially considering the flammability of helium, highlight the importance of carefully evaluating the feasibility and safety of such structures. Despite its historical significance, the practicality and safety concerns surrounding mooring masts on skyscrapers like the Empire State Building suggest that alternative, more secure docking options may be more appropriate in the present day.
1174	16007	6	3	Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal for ships to even go near the building. If a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around due to constant shifting winds caused by violent air currents. Dirigibles are usually moored in open fields, allowing the backs to be weighted down with lead weights to prevent swiveling. However, this posed a danger in a city setting as the weights would hang over downtown New York. Without proper mooring, the violent winds could push the ship into sharp spires, potentially ripping the shell. Additionally, the stress from wind pressure and the dirigible's weight would put too much strain on the building's steel frame. Over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would be needed for the stress to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Furthermore, most dirigibles made in the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. The owners of the Empire State building realized the catastrophic potential of an accident over downtown New York if a dirigible were to catch fire. Given these challenges, the owners and builders decided to postpone the installation of the landing gear, recognizing the risks involved in attempting to accommodate dirigibles at the iconic skyscraper.
1175	16008	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced numerous obstacles in completing their project. Initially, they believed everything was on track, but when they constructed the mooring mast, it did not meet their expectations. This setback meant that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building would never serve its intended purpose. Additionally, a new law prohibited ships from docking at buildings, posing a threat to visitor numbers. However, the builders found a solution by utilizing airplanes to transport passengers to the building. Despite these challenges, they persevered and overcame each obstacle they encountered, ensuring the success of their project."
1176	16009	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon, the reader learns about the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in trying to accommodate dirigibles. Safety was the most crucial concern, especially after the Hindenburg disaster highlighted the dangers of using hydrogen as a power source. The brutal winds at the building's height posed another challenge, with constantly shifting violent air currents making docking difficult. Additionally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tether a dirigible to a building. Despite these hurdles, the Empire State Building ultimately did not become a hub for dirigibles, as airplanes emerged as the preferred mode of transportation.
1177	16010	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One clear obstacle was the law that had existed at the time making it against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. For example on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been it had taken place in downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were too much to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast.
1178	16011	6	3	Throughout the excerpt, obstacles faced by the builders were significant, particularly in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock at the location. One major challenge was the increasing production of dirigibles outside of the United States, which were using hydrogen instead of helium. The builders expressed concern over the use of hydrogen due to its high flammability, especially in a densely populated area like New York. In addition to this, weather conditions posed a constant challenge, with shifting winds causing dirigibles to swivel unpredictably. Recognizing the potential danger posed by these obstacles, the decision was made to shut down operations at the site. These challenges highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of constructing a dirigible docking station in a bustling urban environment like New York.
1179	16012	6	3	"In the construction of the Empire State building the @CAPS1 faced plenty of problems before and after the making of the mast. There were laws preventing the docking of the dirigibles, incidents that had occurred, and flaws in safety. The first problem they should have turned their attention to was the law against low-flying aircraft over urban areas. It is said that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the area."" Another problem faced was the burning of the Hindenburg. The U.S. used helium to keep their dirigibles afloat while other countries were using highly-flammable hydrogen. This posed a big threat and @CAPS1 even started to wonder ""how much worse that incident would be if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The final problem was how un-safe it was to have a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building. The cargo would send the dirigible out of control in these winds. The mast on the Empire State Building had too many problems for the @CAPS1 to solve. It would never make it from the start."
1180	16013	6	3	To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the architects faced numerous obstacles. One major challenge was the fact that a mooring mast could not simply be dropped onto the building's flat roof. The stress of a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top would also put a strain on the building's frame. The architects had to carefully consider these factors when designing the mooring mast. Additionally, nature itself posed a significant obstacle to the project. Despite these challenges, the architects of the Empire State Building were able to overcome these obstacles and create a successful design for dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper.
1181	16014	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders had faced many obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. They had faced many challenges. One of the main concerns was safety. Al Smith had commented, saying ""They were trying to figure some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Safety was a paramount issue that needed to be addressed before any further progress could be made. The builders had to carefully consider all potential risks and ensure that the docking process was as secure as possible. This required meticulous planning and attention to detail to guarantee the safety of both the dirigibles and the individuals involved in the docking process. Despite the challenges they faced, the builders were determined to find a solution that would allow for safe and efficient docking of airships at the mast."
1182	16015	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Despite their initial optimism, they soon realized that the presence of hydrogen-filled dirigibles posed a serious safety risk due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen gas. This became evident on May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg disaster highlighted the potential dangers of having hydrogen-filled dirigibles docked above densely populated areas like downtown New York. Ultimately, the builders had to acknowledge that their original idea was not safe or feasible, leading to the abandonment of the plan. In conclusion, the Empire State Building's intended purpose of accommodating dirigibles was never realized due to safety concerns, highlighting the importance of thorough planning and consideration of potential risks in construction projects.
1183	16016	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were so determined to make sure everything would work out fine that they went to great lengths to ensure its safety and functionality. While the building was not designed for dirigibles to dock there, they still took every precaution to make it a secure and efficient structure. Despite this limitation, the builders focused on creating a landmark that would stand the test of time and serve as a symbol of progress and innovation in the heart of New York City.
1184	16017	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in the original text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible. Despite their efforts, the challenges proved insurmountable, and the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was abandoned."
1185	16018	6	3	Based on the information I just read, the obstacles the builders faced in empire building included the challenge of accommodating dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They encountered difficulties as the city prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, hindering their plans. Additionally, concerns arose about the sharp spires of nearby buildings posing a threat to the dirigibles, potentially causing damage. The captains of the dirigibles also faced issues with relinquishing control due to the design of the airships, complicating the docking process. Moreover, the unpredictable wind patterns posed a risk of steering the dirigibles off course, further complicating the docking procedure. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in finding solutions to allow the dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building.
1186	16019	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include hydrogen gas being highly flammable, high winds and wind shifts at the top of the building, and laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over cities such as New York City. The issue of hydrogen gas safety became evident after a blimp explosion in New Jersey, highlighting the potential danger in an urban environment. Moreover, the challenge of high winds was a concern as the dirigible could swivel around if tethered to the mooring mast. Additionally, legal restrictions on airship travel over cities would have made it illegal for blimps to approach the Empire State Building. These challenges posed significant obstacles for the safe docking of dirigibles at the iconic skyscraper.
1187	16020	6	3	The builders faced various challenges during the construction of the Empire State Building. One significant issue was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles from outside the United States, which posed a fire hazard due to its flammable nature. Moreover, the original design did not account for a mooring mast on the flat roof, requiring a redesign of the structure. Additionally, the competition to build the world's tallest building pushed Al Smith to make the Empire State Building even taller to secure the title. Despite these obstacles, the builders overcame these challenges and successfully completed the iconic skyscraper.
1188	16021	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame if moored at the top with a single cable, requiring modifications to strengthen the structure. Another challenge was the unpredictable wind patterns causing the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to approach the building. The safety concerns posed by the flammability of the gases used in dirigibles, highlighted by the Hindenburg disaster, were also a significant obstacle. These obstacles had to be carefully considered and addressed by the builders to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1189	16022	6	3	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock they are making sure they dont bump into other buildings, and they use rope to drop down the papers. They are trying to make sure that the dirigibles do not pop if it touches the buildings. It is also trying to keep the dirigibles away so they don't get to close and thats why they are droping the papers down with ropes @CAPS1 if they built a little tunnel so the dirigibles can go in they won't have to worry about them getting popped if they touch a building. A tunnel would provide a safe passage for dirigibles to dock without the risk of collision or damage, ensuring a smoother and more efficient docking process for airships at the Empire State Building.
1190	16023	6	3	In addition to safety concerns with flammable hydrogen used in dirigibles, the builders of the Empire State Building also faced challenges from nature. The shifting winds and violent air currents at the top of the building made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The constant movement caused by the winds made it hard to keep the airship in place even when it was tethered. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, adding another obstacle for the builders to overcome. Despite these challenges, the builders were determined to find a solution that would allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast of the iconic Empire State Building.
1191	16024	6	3	Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building in allowing dirigibles to dock. Construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerous as dirigibles could not moor at the building due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, posing a significant threat to dirigibles. As a result, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and the impracticality of landing dirigibles on such a high building ultimately ended the Empire State Building docks.
1192	16025	6	3	In their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered various obstacles. They had to make costly modifications to strengthen the steel, totaling over sixty thousand dollars. Safety concerns arose regarding the use of flammable hydrogen gas in non-American dirigibles, as a potential fire could have devastating effects on the city below. The unpredictable winds on top of the building posed a risk, causing the dirigible on the mast to swivel dangerously. Additionally, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making the mooring mast impractical. Ultimately, the shift in transportation from dirigibles to airplanes rendered the mooring mast obsolete. Due to these structural, safety, and practicality challenges, the builders were unable to successfully install an active mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1193	16026	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they came across many issues. One is the stress on the building from the added mast. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another obstacle to its construction was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". When building the dock, constructors ran into issues which eventually overcame them and led to its uselessness. The stress factors on the building troubled its construction by requiring a sturdy foundation to support the added weight and wind pressure. Additionally, the unpredictable air currents on top of the building made it difficult for dirigibles to safely navigate for docking. These challenges highlighted the complex nature of integrating dirigible docking into the Empire State Building's design, ultimately rendering the endeavor unfeasible."
1194	16027	6	3	Despite the initial plans to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced significant challenges that ultimately led to the decision that it was not safe to proceed with this idea. The use of hydrogen in foreign dirigibles posed a major safety risk due to its flammability, which could potentially endanger the city of New York in the event of an accident. Additionally, the inability to securely tie down the dirigibles further raised safety concerns, as this could pose a danger to the residents of the city. Ultimately, these safety issues were insurmountable, leading to the conclusion that dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building.
1195	16028	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced one giant obstacle. They faced the risk of blowing up the building. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This is one example from the excerpt that could turn into the biggest obstacle. If one were to explode above this building then the building would die. Also a lot of people would die from it too. That is one of the biggest obstacles they faced. The potential threat of a hydrogen-filled dirigible exploding above the building posed a significant risk not only to the structure itself but also to the lives of those nearby. The use of hydrogen as a lifting gas in dirigibles from other countries could potentially lead to a disastrous outcome if not handled with extreme caution. The builders had to navigate this obstacle carefully to ensure the safety of both the building and its occupants."
1196	16029	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles. The framework of the building was not originally designed to withstand the pulling and moving of blimps, posing a risk of damage to the structure. Additionally, the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the 102-story building could cause the dirigibles to vacillate dangerously. There was also a concern about the dirigibles being punctured by other nearby buildings, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences due to the flammable gases used to keep the blimps afloat. Moreover, U.S. laws prohibited airships from flying too close to urban areas like New York City, making it illegal for dirigibles to moor to the Empire State Building. Overall, these challenges made it difficult for the builders to transform the iconic skyscraper into a docking station for dirigibles.
1197	16030	6	3	The Empire State Building builders faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the lack of a proper landing platform for the airships. The building's narrow peak made it difficult for dirigibles to land safely and unload or load passengers and cargo. Additionally, the strong winds at such heights posed a risk to the airships during docking. The builders had to come up with innovative solutions to address these challenges and make the Empire State Building a viable option for dirigible docking. Despite these obstacles, the builders successfully overcame the challenges and created a docking system that allowed dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building.
1198	16031	6	3	Another issue with building dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the lack of suitable land area for a mooring mast. The flat roof of the building could not simply have a mooring mast dropped on it, as the dirigible, held a thousand feet up by a cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. This stress would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, creating structural concerns. Furthermore, safety was a major consideration, as most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. This posed a serious risk, further complicating the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1199	16032	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the beginning, builders were faced with obstacles of very high expectations. Expectations including the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: being ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as said by John Tauranac. With the desire to now be a dock for what was known at the time as the ""transportation of the future"", came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated NYC. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise, was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas. The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building highlight the complexities of meeting both architectural and transportation demands in a rapidly evolving urban environment."
1200	16033	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in accommodating dirigibles included the constraints of limited land area, the challenges posed by wind currents, and the risks associated with the use of hydrogen gas as a lifting agent. The extensive length of some dirigibles, equivalent to four blocks in @ORGANIZATION2, raised concerns about safety and obstruction in a crowded urban environment. Moreover, the impact of wind pressure on the building's foundation at a height of 102 floors necessitated careful consideration. Additionally, the potential hazards of hydrogen gas, exemplified by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, underscored the dangers of using such flammable substances in a densely populated city like New York. These combined obstacles underscored the complexity and risks associated with integrating dirigible docking facilities in urban landscapes, highlighting the need for thorough planning and safety measures.
1201	16034	6	3	"There were many obstacles that got in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Most of these had to do with the framework of the building and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be ""modified and strengthened,"" or else there was no way the building would stay standing. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas. After the construction of the mooring mast, it was soon realized that would never be used. However, despite these challenges, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human innovation and engineering marvel, even if the dream of dirigibles landing on its mast was never realized."
1202	16035	6	3	In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacles the builders faced were hydrogen being highly flammable, winds from nature itself, and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders needed to create a safe place for dirigibles to dock due to the flammability of hydrogen in the balloons. Additionally, they had to contend with shifting winds caused by violent air currents on top of the building. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from tying up or approaching buildings in that area. Despite these challenges, dirigibles did not become the transportation of the future as airplanes ultimately took precedence.
1203	16036	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the lack of a suitable landing area and the added stress a moored dirigible would place on the building's frame. Additionally, the high cost of implementing such a system, estimated at sixty thousand dollars, posed a significant challenge. Safety concerns also played a crucial role, as many dirigibles outside the United States used flammable hydrogen gas instead of helium. Moreover, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building presented a major obstacle to the successful use of a mooring mast. Ultimately, the challenges posed by nature, safety, and financial constraints proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea at the Empire State Building.
1204	16037	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to moor at the top of the building. One significant issue was the fact that dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, making them a fire hazard if they were to get a hole in them. Additionally, the violent air currents at the top of the building caused by shifting winds made it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, posing another obstacle for the builders. These various factors ultimately prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, despite efforts to overcome these challenges.
1205	16038	6	3	Their were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, the unpredictable winds and weather conditions in New York City posed a significant risk to the stability of the dirigibles during docking. The narrow landing space atop the building also made it challenging for dirigibles to safely maneuver and dock without causing damage to the structure or posing a threat to surrounding buildings and people. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building were determined to find a solution that would allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper.
1206	16039	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, with one major obstacle being the shifting winds at the top of the building. These violent air currents made it difficult to safely moor the dirigibles, leading to the decision to weigh them down with lead weights. However, this posed a risk to the people below, necessitating $60,000 worth of modifications to the building's framework. The construction of the mooring mast was a daunting task, requiring careful planning and execution to ensure the safety of all involved. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and ultimately succeeded in creating a docking station for dirigibles atop the iconic Empire State Building.
1207	16040	6	3	The Mooring Mast On December 11, 1929, Al Smith released to the public that the Empire State Building would reach a towering 1,250 feet, becoming the world's tallest building. The plan was to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to dock Dirigibles. However, the builders soon encountered numerous obstacles. When designing the mast, they realized that simply placing it on top would not suffice. The wind pressure combined with the stress of the dirigible being held by a single cable would distribute the stress throughout the building, all the way down to the foundation. To reinforce the framework enough to withstand this stress would cost over a million dollars. Another challenge was safety. In the event of an accident, the highly flammable hydrogen used to fuel the dirigibles in the vicinity could lead to a catastrophic outcome over downtown New York. The most significant obstacle, though, was nature itself. The unpredictable violent air currents would cause the dirigible to shift uncontrollably, posing a danger to those below. Despite the initial ambition, the mooring mast project ultimately failed due to the unforeseen and insurmountable obstacles posed by architecture, safety concerns, and nature.
1208	16041	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading, they talk about how there is not much landing area in New York City but, although adding space for landing the height of the mast would be dangerous, not only for passengers but for those who were on ground level. Also, the thousand plus pound craft would add stress to the building's frame; so the frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigible - which would cost over a significant amount of money. The idea proved to be unsafe when the German dirigible blew up at a nearby location - they realized how dangerous that could be above a densely populated area like New York City.
1209	16042	6	3	In addition to the challenges posed by shifting winds and the risk of flammability with dirigibles using hydrogen, another obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the sheer height of the structure. At 1,454 feet tall, the building presented a formidable target for dirigibles to navigate towards and dock safely. The altitude and surrounding skyscrapers created a complex aerodynamic environment, making it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast with precision. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles, showcasing their determination and ingenuity in overcoming the challenges of integrating airship docking facilities into one of the world's tallest buildings.
1210	16043	6	3	"Based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the reasons for the ideas failure was the fact that there was already a law in place making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the area, as it states in the paragraph. Also, it could've been an extreme fire hazard if a blimp had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proved in the paragraph, where it states, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" which caused the owners to realize, ""how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" On top of all this, weather proposed an even bigger problem. Violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast was ""neither practical nor safe."" I believe the most important reason that the idea failed was that technology was simply advancing beyond predictions. In the paragraph, it says, ""Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" Ultimately, it became clear that the vision of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was not feasible due to a combination of legal restrictions, safety concerns, and technological progress."
1211	16044	6	3	In the passage, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon L¸sted discusses several adversities and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their many obstacles they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. However, before thinking of landing dirigibles, architects had to figure out a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Most of the problems were avoidable, except for the fact that the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This posed a significant challenge for safely docking dirigibles. The architects and engineers had to come up with innovative solutions to overcome these obstacles and ensure the safety of both the dirigibles and the people below. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building eventually became a landmark in aviation history, showcasing the determination and ingenuity of its creators.
1212	16045	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey. It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the people below. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped. Ultimately, the risks and potential dangers associated with docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building outweighed any potential benefits, leading to the abandonment of the plan."
1213	16046	6	3	Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety. This decision likely saved many lives and prevented a potential disaster in the heart of the city.
1214	16047	6	3	The obstacles that the builder faced included ensuring the stability of the building to accommodate a mooring mast. The architects understood that simply placing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was not feasible. Al Smith reassured that the mooring mast was at an acceptable level and that progress was being made. Engineers were tasked with finding efficient and secure arrangements for the mooring airships. However, the government needed to ensure a safe method for the airships to dock at the mast. The addition of a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the building's top would place significant stress on the structure, as it would be held by a single cable tether. This stress could potentially impact the building's frame. To address this, a steel frame was utilized to support the mooring mast. Furthermore, the strong winds at the building's height posed a challenge, causing violent shifts due to air currents. Ultimately, the builder of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock there, necessitating careful planning and engineering solutions to ensure safety and stability.
1215	16048	6	3	The Empire State Building, already famous, sought more attention through a plan by Governor Al Smith to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. Extensive modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars were needed to strengthen the structure for this purpose. The builders envisioned a tower with shiny glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel, and a mast with four wings on all corners, complete with observation areas, elevators, and baggage facilities. Despite meticulous planning and a raised American flag atop the building, the idea of dirigible docking did not materialize due to unforeseen dangers. Following unsuccessful attempts to dock two dirigibles, the building transformed into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for visitors to enjoy.
1216	16049	6	3	When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects experienced many obstacles. The first problem they had was that a thousand-ton dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, leading them to spend a considerable amount to reinforce it. The next issue was the flammability of hydrogen dirigibles, posing a significant risk if one were to catch fire and fall onto New York City. Additionally, the shifting winds above the building would make it impractical and unsafe to tether a dirigible to the mast, especially over pedestrians on the ground. Furthermore, airship laws prohibited dirigibles from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, rendering their mooring mast plans illegal. These obstacles ultimately led to the designers never effectively using the mooring mast as they had initially envisioned.
1217	16050	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles. One of these obstacles they faced was height, and the lack of safety that arose from it. In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which use a highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen. Should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about about their day. The largest obstacle they faced though was nature. Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only teathered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor say if. The third obstacle they faced with a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas. Even as tall as the Empire State Building is, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast. Al Smith's idea finally had to be abandoned due to safety, nature, and state law. Additionally, the architects also struggled with the weight and size of the dirigibles, making it difficult to maneuver them into position for docking. The structural integrity of the mooring mast itself was also a concern, as it had to withstand the forces exerted by the airships during docking and adverse weather conditions. Despite their best efforts, the architects were ultimately unable to overcome these obstacles, leading to the abandonment of the project."
1218	16051	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the weight of the dirigible ""or blimp"", last wind pressure, caused too much stress on the building's frame. The architects easily overcame this obstacle. They strengthened the iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem was safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature was also an enormous obstacle. Wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down. Finally, there was an existing law stating aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas. This combination of factors made it impractical and unsafe to continue with the original plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1219	16052	6	3	The problems that were faced was that the ships could get blown by the wind a hit buildings. Than they thought of putting weighos on the shp, but than they could fall off and hit people on the ground. To address these challenges, engineers and designers had to come up with innovative solutions to ensure the safety of both the ships and the people on the ground. One possible solution could be to develop a more secure way to attach weights to the ships, such as using advanced fastening mechanisms or incorporating them into the ship's structure. Additionally, implementing advanced navigation systems or wind forecasting technologies could help ships navigate more safely in windy conditions. By continuously refining and improving these solutions, the risks associated with ships being blown off course and causing damage can be significantly mitigated.
1220	16053	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many obstacles were described that got in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the Empire State Building had a flat roof and the framework of the building would have to be made stronger to put the mooring mast on there. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. It cost more than $1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle was the law. ""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell. It should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not going to work. Ultimately, the impracticality and safety concerns surrounding the idea of mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building made it clear that this concept was not feasible."
1221	16054	6	3	On the excerpt, there were a lot of obstacles in the attempt to build the Empire State Building and make it safe to dock dirigibles. The first challenge was that engineer Al Smith aimed to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the world. However, the architect of the Chrysler Building had already incorporated a 185 ft spire inside their building. To surpass this, Al Smith envisioned the Empire State Building not just as a tall structure but also as a functional dock for dirigibles. This innovative idea aimed to cater to the future of transportation and aviation. Despite their efforts, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building failed to serve its intended purpose. Even after multiple attempts, like the one with the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles in December 1930, they could not successfully land dirigibles. Unfortunately, the issue with the frame could not be resolved, and the mooring mast remained unutilized. The dream of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible dock never came to fruition, highlighting the challenges faced in adapting structures for new technologies.
1222	16055	6	3	"The Empire State Building started out as a huge sky-scraper. Then Al Smith had to get all competitive and put his crew to full work. The crew had many obstacles to fulfill. First off, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Second, the men made a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower, illuminated inside. Next, they had to add four wings of shiny aluminum to rise a conical roof for housing the mooring arm. Fourth, the crew had to add stairs and elevators to accommodate the ""blimp"" passengers. Lastly, they would add a couple of observation rooms to the 101 and 102 floors. Smith's men worked hard and overcame many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In the end, their efforts paid off, and the iconic building stood tall as a symbol of innovation and architectural marvel."
1223	16056	6	3	"Architects and builders faced several obstacles when attempting to build the empire state building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was maintaining a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire. One example of this is in paragraph 1, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made it dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph 2, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area. All of these obstacles could not be overcome so in the end the mooring mast was not successful. Ultimately, the challenges of maintaining safety, dealing with high wind speeds, and navigating existing laws proved insurmountable in the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1224	16057	6	3	"There were a lot of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, they wanted to add more height to the Empire State Building so it can be, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream"" @PERSON1 said. Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Then they, ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms"". The roof had to be completed before the mast can take place. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. In conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature proved to be a formidable challenge in implementing this ambitious project, despite the meticulous planning and modifications made to the iconic structure."
1225	16058	6	3	"It is within our obligations as human beings to have dreams and want to convert them into reality. Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the empire state building is one I'd consider to be rather erratic. There were many obstacles that proved from early on, the fate of this project was failure. It is apparent from very early into the constructions that this was surreal because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (paragraph 6). Having dirigibles cruising through a large city should have been perceivably impossible to Al Smith, even before the construction of the building occurred. Safety was also something to be seriously taken into consideration since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" which also intertwined with the laws of objects flying too low over an urban area (paragraph 7). The impracticality and safety concerns surrounding Al Smith's dream ultimately led to its downfall, highlighting the importance of realistic and feasible goals in achieving success."
1226	16059	6	3	The first obstacle was to make the Empire State Building the world's tallest building by adding a top or a hat to increase its height. The second obstacle was to facilitate the dropping of people from the mooring mast to the building's flat roof. These challenges required innovative solutions and careful planning to achieve the desired results.
1227	16060	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were quite apparent. One obstacle was that of nature, winds atop the building were at high speeds and always changing, this would make the dirigible unstable and difficult to dock. Another obstacle they faced was that of the passengers and bystanders safety. The dirigible could become uncontrollable putting many lives in danger. The last obstacle the builders faced was that of a law against flying airships too low over urban areas, it would make it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State building. The many obstacles that the builders faced blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State building. Ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable, preventing the realization of this ambitious vision.
1228	16061	6	3	The obstacles the builders would have to face would be things such as structural challenges and worrying about future technological advances. Even if they found out how to land a dirigible on the platform, what about advances on them or new transportation methods. The structural issue was a quick fix, by reinforcing the supports to the building itself. However, they would need to consider long-term solutions to ensure the platform's stability and adaptability to changing technologies in the future. Planning for potential advancements in transportation and infrastructure would be crucial in making the platform a sustainable and viable option for dirigible landings. By staying proactive and flexible in their approach, the builders could overcome these obstacles and create a successful and future-proof landing platform for dirigibles.
1229	16062	6	3	"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating. One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed. Additionally, the issue of the changing winds and the restrictions on flying low over urban areas posed significant challenges that ultimately led to the project's downfall. Despite the best efforts of the builders, the obstacles proved too great to overcome, resulting in the failure of the mooring mast project."
1230	16063	6	3	The first obstacle came when the Empire State Building changed its height. They had constructed a mooring mast, increasing the building by 200 feet. However, it was soon realized that this addition would put excessive stress on the building's frame. Due to new laws and safety concerns following the Hindenburg disaster, it was determined that the mooring mast was not a feasible addition to the building. Therefore, the idea of utilizing the mooring mast was abandoned.
1231	16064	6	3	"First, there was no way to anchor any dirigibles. They couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street. Second, there were laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Additionally, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building. All in all, attempting to fly a dirigible close to skyscrapers in a city like New York would pose significant risks and dangers, making it a highly impractical and hazardous idea."
1232	16065	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that was faced was the buildings foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted, nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This became an obstacle because the building had already been built, so they'd have to work around the existing foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was a law. The law stated ""no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas."" This became an obstacle because they had to convince government people it was safe. Finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was an obstacle because winds could get so bad that the dirigible tied up could rip the roof off and hurt the people below. In conclusion, that is how the builders in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1233	16066	6	3	The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The first one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduce the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars went into modifications of the building's framework. Another problem was the dirigibles themselves. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg incident, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accident such as this would be even more devastating over a densely populated area. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people. Ultimately, safety concerns and the potential risks associated with hydrogen-filled dirigibles led to the abandonment of the idea of dirigibles docking on the iconic Empire State Building.
1234	16067	6	3	When constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, it seemed as if the engineers overlooked many of its flaws, particularly in terms of safety. One major concern was the use of hydrogen or helium in the dirigibles, which posed a significant risk of explosion, as seen in the tragic event of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The volatile air currents at the top of the building also presented a challenge, causing the back of the ships to swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, regulations prohibited dirigibles from flying at certain heights over urban areas, making it illegal to approach the building. Al Smith should have conducted more thorough research into the potential risks and obstacles associated with his mooring mast project. Ultimately, the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building raised serious safety concerns that were not adequately addressed.
1235	16068	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. The frame of the building had to be strengthened to handle the stress of a dirigible moored to it by just one cable. However, even after the mast was completed, several issues arose that prevented its use. Most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, which posed a significant safety risk, especially over a densely populated city like New York. Additionally, the potential for violent winds to push moored blimps into nearby buildings raised concerns about public safety. The lead weights required to prevent this would have posed a danger to pedestrians below. Furthermore, a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas made the use of the mast illegal. These challenges ultimately led to the demise of the mooring mast project, highlighting the various obstacles faced by the builders in their ambitious endeavor.
1236	16069	6	3	The fact that these dirigibles are so big and filled with hydrogen and helium the point at the top would have popped it. Also the Winds were always too high so they would never be able to connect the blimp to the building. Lastly the fact that the German dirigible, Hindenburg burned like that they were afraid for that to happen. Especially in a crowded area such as New York. Additionally, the sheer size of these dirigibles would have made it incredibly difficult to navigate through the busy city streets, posing a significant safety risk to both those on the ground and in the air. The potential for a catastrophic accident, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, was a major concern for authorities and led to the decision to not allow dirigibles to dock in urban areas like New York.
1237	16070	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles. The first major problem they came across was the building itself. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The building being the tallest in the world could not take the pressure. They could possibly make it stronger but at a high cost to something already so monumental. The architects' next obstacle was safety, especially in a highly populated area such as downtown New York. They found the Dirigibles to be too dangerous and uncontrollable in a city of towers. The normal processes of docking a Dirigible would have to completely change to accommodate the mooring mast; soon, laws were given to have airships stay away from areas of population after the Hindenburg incident. Yet some still dared to try and dock at the mast, such as the Los Angeles and Columbia, but the mast was never put to good use and shows the problems with innovating things already as iconic as the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the idea of a mooring mast for Dirigibles on the Empire State Building proved to be unfeasible and impractical due to structural limitations and safety concerns in a densely populated urban environment.
1238	16071	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians. Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings. Additionally, the Empire State Building's height presented challenges for dirigibles to safely approach and dock without causing potential harm to the building or surrounding areas. These obstacles collectively made it impractical and unsafe for dirigibles to utilize the Empire State Building as a docking station.
1239	16072	6	3	Architects and builders faced numerous obstacles when working on building a docking platform on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles. One major concern was whether the building's framework could withstand the weight of a dirigible. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be carefully considered, as it needed to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Additionally, the potential risk of using flammable hydrogen gas in the dirigibles posed a threat, as the violent winds on top of the building could lead to disaster. Another obstacle was public safety, as existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for dirigibles to approach the dock over the city. Ultimately, these challenges led to the abandonment of the idea of using a mooring mast on the Empire State Building for dirigibles.
1240	16073	6	3	After reading excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame. This pressure along with the wind pressure would have to be converted all the way to the buildings foundation. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Although was a bright idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out properly. Additionally, the issue of refueling the dirigibles would have been a logistical challenge, as there was no infrastructure in place for storing and transporting fuel to the top of the building. Moreover, the safety of passengers during the boarding and disembarking process would have been a major concern, as any mishap could have resulted in serious injuries or fatalities. Overall, the idea of docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building was ambitious but ultimately unfeasible due to the numerous obstacles faced by the builders.
1241	16074	6	3	The idea of allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical for several reasons. Firstly, most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, which raises safety concerns for an urban city like New York. Additionally, laws were passed restricting the flight altitude of dirigibles over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. These factors make the concept of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building unsuitable for airship landings. Ultimately, the mooring mast remains more of a tourist attraction than a practical solution for airship transportation in the city.
1242	16075	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originally designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flammable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, they did not take into consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock. Despite the challenges faced by the architects, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to their ingenuity and determination in overcoming obstacles to create an iconic structure."
1243	16076	6	3	In the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the officials of the Empire State Building in their attempt to accommodate dirigibles were primarily due to the lack of a suitable landing area. They aimed to create a safe and convenient docking space for dirigibles to refuel, service, and allow passengers to embark and disembark. To address this challenge, they considered installing an electric winch that could move in the wind, providing a platform for passengers to access the dirigible. However, the greatest obstacle they faced was nature itself, as dirigibles typically moored in open fields at a height that was impractical and unsafe for urban settings. Despite these challenges, the officials of the Empire State Building were determined to find a solution that would enable dirigibles to access their property.
1244	16077	6	3	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The safety of the people were at stake, nature was also a great obstacle, the other reason was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it was against the law. First of all, the builders obstacle that they completely forgot about was the safety of the people. Most of the blimps from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen other than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. And they did not want to risk anyone getting hurt in a densely populated area. Also, another big obstacle was nature itself. At times the winds would be violent and it would go back and forth. And if a blimp was attached, it would be dangling violently over citizens had not nearly safe. Lastly, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas and New York was highly dense. And the reason for this law is for nothing bad to happen to the citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles the builders had gone through, and they were blinded by the project and they wanted to get it done they forgot about safety."
1245	16078	6	3	There would have been multiple obstacles when allowing a dirigible to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. One major challenge would be the densely populated area with many tall buildings surrounding the iconic skyscraper. Additionally, the lack of prior experience in constructing such docking facilities could lead to potential mishaps and safety concerns. Furthermore, the tragic incident of the Hindenburg disaster serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in airship travel, especially in a densely populated urban setting like New York City. Therefore, despite the potential benefits of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the numerous obstacles and safety risks involved would need to be carefully considered and addressed before implementation.
1246	16079	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. They would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast without having it swing in the wind. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was designing the mast. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand the weight of the mast. Additionally, the height of the mast had to be carefully calculated to ensure that it would not interfere with air traffic or be a hazard to the surrounding buildings. Despite these challenges, the builders were able to overcome them and successfully incorporate a mooring mast into the design of the Empire State Building, creating a unique and innovative feature for the iconic skyscraper.
1247	16080	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in the construction of the mast. One major challenge was the need to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to support the mast. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents at the top of the building posed a significant danger to dirigibles attempting to dock at the mast. The shifting winds made it unsafe for passengers to disembark from the dirigibles, as they risked being thrown off or the dirigible floating away rapidly. The builders had to carefully consider these obstacles in order to ensure the safety of both the dirigible passengers and pedestrians below.
1248	16081	6	3	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, until finally they called it quits. According to the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Chrysler building in New York City was about to be the height of the not-built Empire state. The weight and strength of a dirigible could damage the entire building so it would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the blimp to be able to land. The engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability that dirigibles tend to have. In paragraph 1, L¸sted describes a dirigible that exploded in New Jersey not long ago, and that constructing a landing pad over the densely populated New York City, could be detrimental. The constructors of the mooring mast finally came to the conclusion that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe"". The blimps are held down with lead weights and this could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to ever go wrong. The builders of the Empire State building had a lot to think about in regards to constructing the dirigible dock, and in the end, it was for the better that they decided against it. Ultimately, the potential risks and challenges outweighed the benefits of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building, leading to the wise decision to abandon the project."
1249	16082	6	3	In addition to the challenges of unpredictable winds, the use of hydrogen, and air laws, the builders of the Empire State Building also faced the issue of limited technology at the time. The technology required to safely moor a dirigible to the spire was not advanced enough to guarantee the safety of passengers and crew. Furthermore, the lack of suitable landing gear on the dirigibles themselves made it difficult to successfully dock them at the Empire State Building. Despite the ambitious plans to use the spire as a mooring mast, these technological limitations ultimately prevented this vision from becoming a reality. The combination of these obstacles highlights the complexity and difficulty of implementing such a innovative idea in the early 20th century.
1250	16083	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the owners of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents, and existing laws in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The first obstacle was the flammability of hydrogen used in most dirigibles outside the United States, as seen in the destruction of a German dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This incident highlighted the potential danger if such an event were to occur above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Another challenge was the issue of violent air currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast even when tethered, posing risks to pedestrians below. Furthermore, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas presented a barrier to the dirigibles approaching the building for docking. The law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to a building, hindering the plans for dirigibles to access New York City. These obstacles combined made the vision of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building a complex and challenging endeavor for its owners."
1251	16084	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure could have caused problems to the buildings foundation. A thousand-foot dirigble, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Safety was another issue, most dirigbles outside the United States used hydrogen, instead of helium. This is a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigble Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. The accident would have been more dangerous in New York because the city is densely populated. Another reason why they faced problems to allow dirigibles to dock is because there was an existing law against airships flying too close over urban areas. In December 1930, the R-101 dirigble did attempt to reach the mooring mast but could not reach because of the winds, fearing that it may blow the dirigble onto sharp spires of other buildings. This would puncture the dirigbles shell.
1252	16085	6	3	"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Indeed, the builders were able to overcome this problem. After the building, however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for its full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the preexisting law against low-flying aircraft. This put an end to Al Smith's dreams."
1253	16086	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builder of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. Al Smith's concern about the height of the building and the proximity of the blimps floating above it suggests potential safety issues. His statement about engineers in New York and Government officials in Washington working on a practical and safe mooring arrangement indicates a level of confusion and uncertainty surrounding the situation. This uncertainty and the challenges of finding a safe and workable solution to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are clearly obstacles that need to be overcome.
1254	16087	6	3	There were many obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was that some dirigibles were @NUM1 feet long which was four blocks in New York City. This was an obstacle because it would add stress to the buildings' frame when it was attached by single tether. In order for this to happen the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be strengthened and modified. The next obstacle they faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For example, in the excerpt it said that the U.S. navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also the captain could not even take his hands off the lever. The next obstacle they faced was the safety issue. The builders of said the dirigibles are weighted down by lead but if they did that it would be a safety issue. It would be a safety issue since the dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. The last obstacle they faced was the law against flying to low over urban areas. It would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles trying to dock, as the altitude was intimidating and difficult to navigate for airships. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to create a docking station for dirigibles atop the iconic skyscraper.
1255	16088	6	3	The extreme winds posed a significant challenge for the builders, as the dirigibles would be tossed around unpredictably, making it dangerous for them to attempt to dock. Additionally, the flammable nature of the hydrogen used in foreign dirigibles added another layer of risk to the docking process. Moreover, the legal restrictions on airship flight paths further complicated the feasibility of utilizing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered in their efforts to make dirigible docking a reality on the iconic skyscraper.
1256	16089	6	3	Many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One major issue was the danger posed by non-U.S. dirigibles using highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium. The risk of a potential disaster like the German dirigible crash was a significant concern for downtown New York. Additionally, the unpredictable and strong wind patterns on top of the Empire State Building made docking even more challenging. Using lead weights to anchor the dirigibles could also endanger people below. Moreover, the legal restrictions on flying low over urban areas presented a significant obstacle. Despite two attempts, the dangers and complications of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building were evident.
1257	16090	6	3	Based on the expert, builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building was never thought of as an easy task to accomplish. One obstacle that builders would face is safety, as most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A. use hydrogen, which is highly flammable compared to helium. This poses a significant risk of fire, which could be extremely dangerous. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself. Violent shifting winds could cause the dirigibles to sway and dangle high above the pedestrians, posing a threat to both people and builders. Additionally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up or come close to the area. This legal barrier added another layer of difficulty for builders to overcome in their quest to make dirigible docking a reality. In conclusion, the challenges faced by builders in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were significant and multifaceted, ultimately contributing to the idea never coming to fruition.
1258	16091	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was the stress that a single tether would add to the building's frame, requiring over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. Additionally, some dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium, posing a significant risk over a densely populated area. However, the most challenging obstacle was the violent air currents at the building's peak, causing the ship to swivel unpredictably. To counter this, lead weights would be necessary, but having them dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Ultimately, it became clear that the numerous issues involved in using a mooring mast at the Empire State building outweighed the potential benefits."
1259	16092	6	3	"To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of the obstacles had dealt with the dirigible itself. For example, the dirigible was highly unsafe and flammable by the 1930s. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highly dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go through. Despite the challenges faced, the Empire State Building remains a symbol of innovation and architectural achievement in New York City."
1260	16093	6	3	The experts faced significant obstacles in building the Empire State Building, including challenges with the frame and air currents. To support the structure's height and ability to withstand aircraft landings, they made modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars, adding stainless steel and chrome-nickel windows to reduce pressure. Additionally, they had to address the violent wind currents at almost 1,250 feet, particularly concerning the refueling of dirigibles. The risk of a dirigible coming loose and crashing was a major concern due to the potential danger to pedestrians below. Al Smith's original idea was ambitious, but the practical challenges proved daunting. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to innovative engineering and perseverance in the face of adversity.
1261	16094	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when considering the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock there. One major concern was the additional stress that would be placed on the building's structure, as any modifications to accommodate dirigibles would increase this stress. Not only would the steel frame need to be modified and strengthened, but it would also require a significant investment of over $1 million. Safety was another major issue, as most dirigibles used flammable hydrogen gas instead of the safer helium. Additionally, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of the project. Ultimately, these obstacles proved insurmountable, leading the builders to abandon the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1262	16095	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles, which could result in a disastrous explosion if a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area. However, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature itself. Mooring a large airship like a dirigible or a zeppelin on top of a building where winds are violently shifting is extremely dangerous. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing a significant threat. In contrast, dirigibles moored in open fields where they could be weighed down with lead weights, providing stability. Having a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, dangling high above pedestrians, is neither safe nor practical. The construction of the Empire State Building faced far more challenges and obstacles than its architects had anticipated.
1263	16096	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems when considering the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the ships, added stress to the building, and safety concerns all posed significant challenges to the feasibility of landing blimps on the iconic skyscraper.  The nature of the airships themselves presented issues, as their size and shape could cause the building to sway in the wind. This movement could lead to tangling of the mooring cable, requiring captains to use lead counterweights to stabilize the ships. However, these counterweights hanging over busy streets would create a hazard for pedestrians below.  Additionally, the added stress of the airships docking on the building would require costly modifications to its foundation, with renovations estimated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. This expense further complicated the practicality of implementing a dirigible docking system.  Safety was perhaps the most critical concern, as the airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The presence of other buildings with sharp spires nearby increased the risk of a potential disaster if a ship were to collide with one of these structures.  In conclusion, the challenges posed by the nature of the ships, the additional stress on the building, and safety considerations made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building ultimately unfeasible and impractical.
1264	16097	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The unpredictable wind conditions at the top of the building posed a significant safety hazard, as even when secured, the dirigibles could swing dangerously. Additionally, the use of highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium in dirigibles added to the safety concerns. The tragic destruction of the Hindenburg in 1937 served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers, especially if such an accident were to occur above a densely populated area like New York City. These safety risks and past tragedies made it challenging for the builders to create a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1265	16098	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced included the risk of flying blimps too low in the area and the challenge of making the Empire State Building taller than originally planned. In 1929, Al Smith realized the danger of losing the title of the world's tallest building and decided to increase the building's height to 1,250 ft by adding a top or hat. This adjustment would surpass the height of any other building in the city. Another obstacle was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low above urban areas to prevent potential accidents and ensure public safety. Flying at low altitudes posed a significant risk, potentially endangering the lives of many people. Despite these challenges, the builders successfully navigated these obstacles to create the iconic Empire State Building, a testament to human ingenuity and determination.
1266	16099	6	3	In the excerpt, the builders faced multiple obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. They had to make the steel frame of the building stronger, increase its height to 102 stories, and create an observatory on the 101st story. Lastly, they had to overcome the challenge of constructing the empire state building.
1267	16100	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the challenges faced by builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. One obstacle was the stress a huge dirigible held at the top of the building by a single cable would place on the structure, requiring costly modifications to stabilize it. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of winds, with violent air currents causing the dirigibles to swivel around even when tied to the mast, posed a safety risk to pedestrians below. Furthermore, a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal to dock ships at the Empire State Building. These obstacles collectively prevented the possibility of dirigibles being able to dock at the top of the iconic building, highlighting the complex challenges faced during its construction.
1268	16101	6	3	"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would have had to deal with, the mast was never built, and it was very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there. The challenges and obstacles were insurmountable, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious project."
1269	16102	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the architects faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Initially, they couldn't install a mooring mast due to concerns about adding stress to the building's frame. To address this, the architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. Before installing the mooring mast, they designed a tower made of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel to complement the building's overall shape. However, even after completing the roof and attempting to attach the mooring mast, it proved unsuccessful. During testing, the dirigible was unable to get close enough for docking. Ultimately, the plans for ""The Mooring Mast"" at the Empire State Building did not come to fruition."
1270	16103	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building included the challenge of creating a structure that was not only tall but also visually impressive. They aimed to surpass existing skyscrapers in both height and grandeur. To achieve this goal, they had to overcome engineering challenges related to the unprecedented height of the building. Additionally, they had to ensure that the building was structurally sound and could withstand the strong winds that would buffet it at such heights. Despite these obstacles, the builders were determined to create a landmark that would stand the test of time and become an iconic symbol of New York City. Ultimately, their hard work and dedication paid off, and the Empire State Building remains a beloved and awe-inspiring structure to this day.
1271	16104	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their plans to allow dirigibles to dock there. The steel frame needed strengthening to support the load, safety concerns arose due to the flammability of hydrogen used in the blimps, and existing laws restricted airships from flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, heavy winds and limited space made it difficult to secure the dirigibles at the building's mooring mast. Ultimately, the architects encountered insurmountable obstacles that prevented the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1272	16105	6	3	When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned to be the tallest building. However, not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In the 1930s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. However, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, posing the first obstacle of finding a suitable landing area in the city. The architects also could not simply drop a mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's roof, as a 1000-foot dirigible moored at the top would stress the building's frame. Safety concerns for the people in the building were another obstacle that the workers encountered. Ultimately, the practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its intended purpose, highlighting the challenges faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
1273	16106	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever more there. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles. With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people few on airships anymore. In conclusion, several obstacles prevented the docking of dirigibles to the Empire State Building. Additionally, the lack of infrastructure and equipment for dirigibles to safely dock and unload passengers at the building also hindered their ability to utilize the space for airship travel. Moreover, the logistical challenges of coordinating air traffic and ground operations in a busy city environment further complicated the feasibility of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1274	16107	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. A mooring mast needed to be added for the dirigibles to anchor there. The architects had to find a way to add ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" without adding stress to the building's frame. However, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was the unpredictable nature of the weather. The architects knew they could not control the weather, which caused them great concern.  Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There was a fear that if dirigibles were able to reach the building, something could go wrong. Builders were concerned that the wind could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, posing a significant risk.  Ultimately, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers quietly disappeared. The obstacles proved too challenging to overcome, and the vision of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned."
1275	16108	6	3	In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the works faced numerous challenges. Firstly, they had to invest sixty thousand dollars in modifications to ensure the building could withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible. Additionally, existing laws prohibited dirigibles from descending low enough to dock safely. Furthermore, the unpredictable wind currents and weather conditions posed a significant risk, as dirigibles could potentially be blown into sharp rooftops of nearby buildings. Unlike landing in open fields where they could be weighed down with lead, dirigibles would be tied up, dangling precariously over pedestrians. Despite their efforts, creating a safe mooring dock for dirigibles at the Empire State Building proved to be a daunting and nearly impossible task due to these various obstacles.
1276	16109	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended too late. First, they had to figure out a way to execute the plan, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe approach. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. However, the dirigible being held on by one cable would add stress to the building's frame and potentially impact its foundation. Another significant obstacle was the flammability of dirigibles, posing a risk to people and other structures in the vicinity. Moreover, weather conditions could affect the safety of the dirigible, especially in rough conditions. Additionally, there was a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of the plan. Overall, these obstacles highlighted the challenges and safety concerns associated with incorporating dirigibles into the design of the Empire State building.
1277	16110	6	3	The obstacles of The Empire State Building were some big ones which led to some Problems. For example, there was a lack of a landing area for the Dirigible. But the main reason was the lack of safety there for This dream could not be accomplished. In addition, the lack of proper ventilation and fireproofing made it challenging to ensure the safety of occupants in case of emergencies. These obstacles posed significant challenges in the construction and operation of the Empire State Building, highlighting the importance of addressing safety concerns in ambitious architectural projects.
1278	16111	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obstacle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" The builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."
1279	16112	6	3	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Despite this, some dirigibles attempted it, but the proximity to other buildings made it too dangerous. Additionally, safety was a major concern as most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would have been catastrophic. Moreover, the mast was not suitable for holding a dirigible securely. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, posing a significant risk. Ultimately, the builders had to acknowledge that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was not equipped to handle dirigibles and was destined to fail.
1280	16113	6	3	They said that the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. The builders faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, requiring innovative solutions to ensure the building's functionality went beyond mere aesthetics.
1281	16114	6	3	While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930s, many workers and financial individuals faced challenges when attempting to dock these airships. Dirigibles were essentially live propellers that passengers could ride in a closed compartment under the balloon. However, they posed significant risks, especially when using hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of the safer helium. This was exemplified by the tragic explosion of the German dirigible Hindenburg on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Following this disaster, the popularity of dirigibles for transportation waned, leading to their eventual decline by the late 1930s. However, the creativity and ingenuity of repurposing the passenger baggage compartments of dirigibles into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden showcased the adaptive nature of innovation in the face of adversity.
1282	16115	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature, and the law. Safety concerns arose due to the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles, as demonstrated by the tragic incident of the Hindenburg. Nature posed a threat as violent air currents could potentially cause damage to the dirigibles and harm pedestrians. Additionally, legal restrictions prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to tie up to the building. These obstacles ultimately made it impractical for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, despite initial intentions.
1283	16116	6	3	"In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, we learn about how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually meant to be a landing spot for dirigibles. However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because they were mostly made of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since the dirigible would possibly catch fire about New York City. Next, there was the problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent and the back of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around. Using lead weights to hold it down were a possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their endeavor to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast were insurmountable due to the flammability of hydrogen, the violent winds at the top of the mast, and the legal restrictions on airship flights over populated areas."
1284	16117	6	3	Construction always has challenges. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to land dirigibles there. Some of the challenges included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the need for frame modifications, the high cost involved, and the unpredictable nature of the wind at the building's height. Landing the massive dirigibles, each a thousand feet long, posed a significant difficulty due to their size and weight. The stress of their load and wind pressure had to be supported all the way down to the building's foundation, requiring extensive modifications to the steel frame. This modification process itself presented a financial hurdle, with over sixty thousand dollars needed for the necessary changes. The builders also had to contend with nature's unpredictability, as violent air currents constantly shifted the winds at the building's peak. These natural forces added another layer of complexity to an already challenging task. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their efforts to facilitate dirigible docking, from the sheer size of the airships to the financial burden of modifications and the ever-changing winds at the building's height.
1285	16118	6	3	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, discusses the height of the iconic Empire State Building and Chrysler Building in New York City. The architect of the Chrysler Building incorporated a hidden 185-foot spire within the structure, surprising many when it was revealed and raised to the top, making the building taller than the Empire State Building. The idea of a mooring mast on top of the building to accommodate dirigibles was proposed by Al Smith, but the challenge was to ensure it wouldn't compromise the building's structural integrity. After careful planning and construction, the mooring mast was successfully added, allowing for the raising of the American flag once again."
1286	16119	6	3	In addition to safety concerns due to the flammability of hydrogen, the shifting winds on top of the Empire State Building posed a significant challenge for dirigible docking. The unpredictable air currents could cause the dirigible to swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast, making it difficult to secure the airship safely. Furthermore, the presence of sharp spires on neighboring buildings heightened the risk of a dirigible being blown off course and colliding with other structures in the area. These factors, combined with legal restrictions on airship flights over urban areas, ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building.
1287	16120	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians."
1288	16121	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. Obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around. Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause stress to the building. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the US used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came into play. Usually, they would weigh them down, but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The idea was never successful due to the obstacles presented.
1289	16122	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it would add a lot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong a lot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be too much pressure on the building. Lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York a lot of innocent lives will be gone. Additionally, the design of the building itself posed challenges in creating a secure docking station for dirigibles, as the structure needed to be reinforced to withstand the additional weight and force. Overall, the obstacles faced in accommodating dirigibles at the Empire State Building were significant and multifaceted, requiring careful planning and consideration of various factors to ensure the safety and functionality of the mooring mast.
1290	16123	6	3	"The builders faced many different obstacles in their attempt to allowing Blimps to dock there. There were two major obstacles. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM1). If a blimp had an accident like the Hindenburg, not only would the Empire State building go down, it would affect other buildings and people too because of the city's population. Lastly the other large effect on the building was the weather. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2). The winds could have easily knock it over with a blimp attatched to it for this reason: ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2). As result to this the blimb would be so close to the mast that if a strong enoungh wind was blowing, the blimps weight you take the mast with it. All in all weather and hydrogen blimps with the builders' two major obstacles."
1291	16124	6	3	Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plausible in theory, but as it was put in motion, the workers faced multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The building had to be strengthened to adjust to the added stress of the blimp, but the biggest hindrance was the unpredictable nature of the winds at such heights. The winds caused the dirigible to swivel uncontrollably, making it unsafe for landing. Additionally, most blimps used a flammable gas, posing a significant fire hazard if they were to land high above New York City. Moreover, existing laws made it illegal to have anything tied up so low over an urban area, further complicating the feasibility of the mooring mast. Despite the initial vision to prepare the building for the future of transportation, the insurmountable challenges led to the abandonment of the project.
1292	16125	6	3	The problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly related to safety concerns. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for airships to safely navigate for docking. Additionally, the idea of having lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street posed a significant risk to public safety. Another obstacle was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would have made it challenging to obtain the necessary permissions for the dirigibles to operate near the building. Overall, these safety issues presented significant challenges for the builders in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1293	16126	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, would be things such as the different usage of air. A sentence I found to follow this reason would be in paragraph when said, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would cause many problems and face many obstacles. Another reasoning I found was wind. A reason I found would be as stated in paragraph, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This would be something difficult to fix. As other obstacles I found such as the size and density, I find these two to be the best reasoning."
1294	16127	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely dock due to the lack of a stable and secure landing platform. The potential dangers and risks associated with docking dirigibles on the skyscraper further complicated the feasibility of implementing such a system. Despite the innovative idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the numerous obstacles and safety concerns ultimately led to the abandonment of this ambitious project.
1295	16128	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were a few main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. It would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flammable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densely populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. A final dilemma was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Due to these obstacles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to fail.
1296	16129	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems trying to make dirigibles able to dock there. One problem was that the blimps use hydrogen instead of helium to fly. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The blimps were unable to be used because they were a major safety issue for the people being transported. Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring asked, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles are usually put down in open fields with the back ends can be put down with lead weights; the blimps dangling high above pedestrians was nether practical nor safe. The builders for the empire state building faced many obstacles. Additionally, the sheer height of the building made it difficult for the blimps to safely navigate and dock, as the winds at such altitudes were unpredictable and turbulent. Furthermore, the lack of space on the top of the building for maneuvering the large dirigibles posed a significant challenge. Despite the best efforts of the builders, the idea of using dirigibles for transportation to and from the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed unfeasible due to these various challenges."
1297	16130	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in completing their task. When Al Smith announced that the building would reach a height of 1,250 feet, it presented a significant challenge for the workers who had to risk their lives working at such extreme heights. Additionally, another obstacle for the workers was the proximity to the dirigibles. These airships were highly flammable, posing a serious risk to the safety of the workers. If a dirigible were to catch fire, the workers could be in grave danger. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in constructing the iconic Empire State Building, demonstrating their resilience and dedication to the project.
1298	16131	6	3	"In the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was getting the passengers on and off the dirigibles safely. In conclusion, I have shown the obstacles that the builders have faced on the @ORGANIZATION1, including challenges related to landing areas and passenger safety."
1299	16132	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted describes the problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced like the amount of stress that the dirigibles would add to the frame of the building. safety issues and laws, and the winds around the mast. Any dirigible would add on tremendous stress to the already constructed frame of the building and builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought about before construction started. The builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as ""a higher calling."" The challenges faced during the construction of the mooring mast highlight the importance of thorough planning and consideration of potential obstacles in any engineering project."
1300	16133	6	3	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hydrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed. To address this risk, strict safety measures and protocols were put in place to prevent any accidental sparks or ignition sources near the dirigibles, ensuring the safety of the building and its occupants."
1301	16134	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there were primarily related to the building's height. The steel frame of the building had to undergo costly modifications to accommodate the docking of blimps, amounting to over six thousand dollars. Additionally, the instability of the mast due to the building's extreme height posed a significant challenge, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, influenced by violent air currents. Moreover, state laws also hindered the docking of dirigibles, with regulations being put in place that prohibited ships from tying up to the building. These obstacles collectively made it difficult for blimps to dock at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complexities involved in integrating such a feature into the iconic structure.
1302	16135	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders were significant, with the Mooring Mast being a major challenge due to its inability to support an airship with the original design of the building. To overcome this issue, the building had to undergo modifications and strengthening, including the addition of a rocket-shaped tower made of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. This tower not only increased the building's height to 102 floors but also featured interior lighting that would illuminate the structure.
1303	16136	6	3	Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws restricting plane height, the use of hydrogen fuel by some dirigibles, and the challenge of strong wind currents at great heights. The restriction on plane height was due to existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, dirigibles from outside the U.S. using hydrogen instead of helium posed a potential risk, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Moreover, the strong and shifting wind currents on top of the building made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. In conclusion, the builders encountered various challenges in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1304	16137	6	3	There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. One major challenge was the issue of weight; simply placing a mooring mast on the building would have caused it to collapse. To address this, over sixty thousand dollars had to be invested in reinforcing the framework. Additionally, there were safety concerns, particularly regarding the use of hydrogen gas in dirigibles from other countries. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the risk of a fire breaking out above New York City was a significant threat. Another issue was the unpredictable and violent weather conditions at the top of the building, which could cause the dirigibles to sway dangerously, making it difficult for passengers to board and disembark. Furthermore, New York City had a law prohibiting low-flying vehicles, making it illegal for dirigibles to dock in the city in the first place. These challenges made it clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building would be a complex and risky endeavor.
1305	16138	6	3	The challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were numerous. Apart from dealing with the natural elements such as violent air currents at the building's height, they also had to contend with existing laws that prohibited airships from flying too low or over urban areas. The design oversight of only tethering the blimp in the front also contributed to the difficulty of mooring dirigibles at the building. In the end, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building proved to be too ambitious and impractical.
1306	16139	6	3	There were a few obstacles to making this idea work. One of the obstacles was to make the mast and the frame of the building strong enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind. There was over $1 million spent on modifications to the building. Additionally, they had to add a few floors to the building for a total of 102 floors. These adjustments were crucial to ensure the success of the project and make the building capable of accommodating a dirigible. By overcoming these challenges and making the necessary enhancements, the building was transformed into a unique and innovative structure that could support this ambitious concept.
1307	16140	6	3	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would neither be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small mooring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face. Additionally, the weather conditions in New York City could pose a significant challenge for dirigibles attempting to dock at the Empire State Building. High winds, fog, and other unpredictable weather patterns could make it dangerous for a dirigible to approach or depart from the mooring mast. Furthermore, the limited space at the top of the building would make it difficult for dirigibles to maneuver and dock safely. Overall, the construction of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building presented a multitude of obstacles that needed to be carefully considered and addressed."
1308	16141	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such attempt involved the Goodyear blimp Columbia, which tried a publicity stunt by delivering a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as mentioned in the text. However, the builders soon realized that nature itself presented the greatest obstacle to the successful use of a mooring mast on the building. Despite their efforts to overcome these challenges, the builders ultimately faced insurmountable difficulties in making the dirigible docking a viable option. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered various obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of this idea.
1309	16142	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Firstly, there was simply not enough room on the building to accommodate the large airships. Additionally, regulations at the time prohibited aircraft from flying near the city, making it difficult to obtain the necessary permissions for such a project. Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately had to abandon the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock there, opting instead to focus on other aspects of the iconic building's design and functionality.
1310	16143	6	3	Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigible dangling nearly @NUM1 feet above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the building's frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around, the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about @NUM1 feet down. In order for this to work, the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself; strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown off course and into another building. Additionally, if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place, they should have checked the laws first; aircraft were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. The builders of this landing dock and the Empire State Building just faced too many obstacles, making the idea of dirigibles docking there unfeasible.
1311	16144	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mostly due to the dangers of violent winds at such an altitude that may cause the aircraft to crash either into the building or down to the ground. For example, two blimps attempted the docking and one of them could not come close to the building because of winds. The other was able to deliver a bundle of newspapers hoisted down by a rope. In conclusion, the main problem was the instability of the aircraft being docked. However, despite these challenges, the builders continued to explore ways to make dirigible docking possible at the Empire State Building, showcasing their determination and innovative spirit in overcoming obstacles for progress.
1312	16145	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. One of the obstacles they faced was safety, because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Bloomberg). If the dirigible burst into flames in New York, a lot of people would die. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds were violent on top of the building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (Bloomberg). This would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (Bloomberg). Although this was broken twice, it was still illegal to dock dirigibles at that low height. As a cause of all these obstacles, the idea to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was scrapped. The risks posed by the flammable hydrogen, the challenging winds, and the legal restrictions ultimately led to the abandonment of this ambitious plan."
1313	16146	6	3	The builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because they had to plan out how it would work and what materials would be needed for it to be successful. They needed to consider the weight and size of the dirigibles, as well as the strength and durability of the materials used in the construction. One of the key materials that would be needed for this project is a strong and flexible mooring mast that could withstand the forces exerted by the dirigibles. Additionally, they would need to use materials such as steel cables and reinforced concrete to ensure the stability and safety of the docking station. By carefully planning out the design and materials needed for the dirigible docking station, the builder of the Empire State Building could overcome the obstacles and create a successful and innovative addition to the iconic skyscraper.
1314	16147	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when it came to designing a suitable docking station for dirigibles. One major issue was the difficulty of creating a docking station at such a great height while ensuring it looked aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, the safety concerns surrounding the use of dirigibles were a significant problem. Most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, making the risk of fire and explosion a real danger, especially in a densely populated area like New York City. To address these safety and structural issues, the builders had to find innovative solutions, such as using large lead weights to stabilize the dirigibles during docking. Despite these challenges, the builders were ultimately able to resolve the issues and successfully incorporate a docking station for dirigibles into the design of the iconic Empire State Building.
1315	16148	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, @CAPS1 faced numerous obstacles. One significant challenge was the issue of safety due to the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles, which is highly flammable. This concern was highlighted by the tragic destruction of the German Dirigible Hindenburg in a fire. Additionally, violent air currents posed a threat to the docking of dirigibles on the building. Moreover, there was a law in place that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the docking process. Despite these challenges, @CAPS1 persevered in their efforts to make dirigible docking a reality on the Empire State Building.
1316	16149	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first issue was the flammability of hydrogen used in most dirigibles outside of the United States. This posed a significant risk to the highly populated city of New York in case of a fire or explosion. Secondly, the constantly shifting winds on top of the building made it difficult for airships to remain stable while tethered to the mooring mast, rendering boarding impossible. Lastly, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for them to even approach the Empire State Building for docking. These obstacles combined made it clear that the Empire State Building was not a suitable location for dirigibles to dock, and the idea was ultimately abandoned.
1317	16150	6	3	Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building brought up many challenges for the builders. There was a huge safety issue having the blimps so close to the city. The fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flammable gas and if the blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; in fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City and the passengers of the dirigible safe.
1318	16151	6	3	"One of the obstacles builders faced was nature itself. The @CAPS1 States ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was that ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The @CAPS1 states ""This law will make it illegal for a ship to ever be tied up to the building."" These challenges posed significant hurdles for the builders in their efforts to construct the building."
1319	16152	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the architect of the building, wanted to give it a purpose beyond just being a showpiece. However, adding a dock for dirigibles would put significant stress on the building's frame, making it potentially unsafe. To accommodate the dock, alterations would need to be made to the frame and wind pressure, requiring significant structural changes. Furthermore, the risk of accidents, like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, posed a threat to the densely populated city below. While these obstacles could potentially be overcome, the unpredictability of mother nature remains a challenge that cannot be fully mitigated.
1320	16153	6	3	"As it was the idea of a dirigibles dock was quite far fetched. The first problem they encountered was that having a thousand foot long dirigible attached to the empire state building would cause a great strain on the building's framework, they would have to change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework. The largest problem was a matter of safety. Dirigibles use hydrogen which is extremely flammable, also the author states ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" making the idea of a dirigibles dock extremely risky. They should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock."
1321	16154	6	3	"Builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the dirigible would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed there. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible. Some used hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast."" The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building."" The attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building failed. There were too many obstacles, ranging from structural concerns to safety risks and legal restrictions, ultimately preventing the realization of this ambitious idea."
1322	16155	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire building faced numerous challenges in accommodating dirigibles. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted to the building's foundation, requiring careful design and engineering. Additionally, the engineers had to devise a safe way to dock a thousand-foot dirigible with a single cable tether, ensuring the safety of both the dirigible and those involved in the docking process. Overall, the engineers had to overcome various obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1323	16156	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The builders could not simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The builders now had to find a way to add this mooring mast for dirigibles without putting too much pressure on the building. In addition, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They now had to add ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications to the building. In conclusion, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" @CAPS1 the architects went through much work not only to make the mooring mast for dirigibles successful, but beautiful. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 shows the many obstacles architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Architects had to carefully consider the structural integrity of the building while also incorporating a visually appealing design for the mooring mast."
1324	16157	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was the unpredictable wind currents at nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles struggled to even get close enough to the mast due to the constantly changing harsh winds. The captain had to maintain constant control in fear of damaging the outer shell. Furthermore, the safety concerns were significant, as most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen. Tying a dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building posed a serious risk due to these obstacles. Ultimately, the challenges of the wind currents and safety considerations made docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1325	16158	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by an electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing, it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it too dangerous for the public. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock, ultimately leading to the decision to abandon the idea due to safety concerns."
1326	16159	6	3	"There were obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the many obstacles the dirigibles had to face was the lack of a suitable landing area, which I found on paragraph six. Another obstacle would be on paragraph seven where it says ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature itself would be another obstacle for the dirigibles, because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Last but not least, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even go near the area. In conclusion, these were some out of the many obstacles a dirigible had to face. Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building persisted and found ways to overcome them, leaving a lasting legacy in the history of architecture and engineering."
1327	16160	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the Hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbade airships to fly too low over urban areas, but the factor of nature made the mooring mast idea completely unfeasible. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to violent air currents; even the captain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point, it was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work, and dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived. Ultimately, the impracticality and safety concerns surrounding the mooring mast at the Empire State Building led to its abandonment in favor of more advanced forms of aviation.
1328	16161	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles. The first challenge involved modifying the frame of the building to accommodate the stress that the mooring mast would impose. This required significant alterations costing over sixty thousand dollars to ensure the load of the dirigible and wind pressure could be safely transmitted to the building's foundation, eleven-hundred feet below.   Another significant obstacle was the use of hydrogen gas within the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, posed a severe risk in the event of an accident above the densely populated downtown area of New York City. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building presented a challenge, with violent air currents causing the dirigible to swivel erratically around the mast.   Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mooring mast. These combined obstacles rendered it impractical for a dirigible to ever successfully dock at the Empire State Building.
1329	16162	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time. Were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. With the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying to low over urban areas. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream. Despite the grand vision of dirigibles docking at the Empire State building, the dangers posed by flammable hydrogen, unpredictable winds, and legal restrictions made it an unattainable feat. The builders were ultimately unable to overcome these obstacles, leaving the dream of dirigibles docking at the iconic skyscraper nothing more than a fantasy.
1330	16163	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when trying to accommodate dirigibles. One major obstacle was ensuring the building could handle the stress of a dirigible swinging around it in the wind, requiring a design that could distribute wind pressure down to the foundation. Additionally, the strong winds in the building's vicinity made docking difficult, causing dirigibles to be tossed around uncontrollably. Despite this, a winch was eventually implemented to assist with docking. However, the inherent danger of dirigibles, coupled with a law prohibiting them from flying near buildings due to safety concerns, ultimately prevented successful dirigible docking on the Empire State Building.
1331	16164	6	3	During this time period, dirigibles were seen as the transportation of the future, and everybody thought that this was plausible. There were problems, however, that nobody saw through. For example, the dirigibles were seen to be the next big thing in transportation, but there was no evidence to support this. They spent all of their time, effort, and resources to construct something for a purpose that never worked. There were other problems that were overlooked as well, such as the wind speed at that height, and even if they could get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be too hard for one person. As the excerpt shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this problem too quickly and with insufficient information. The lack of comprehensive research and consideration of practical challenges led to the failure of dirigibles as a viable transportation option. It serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of thorough planning and analysis before investing in ambitious projects.
1332	16165	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, two architects play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, competing for most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature. The winds caused the mast's to be clanging above human beings, which was not practical or safe. Another obstacle they faced was the limited technology of the time, making it difficult to control the height and stability of the dirigibles. These challenges made the construction and operation of the mooring mast a risky and complex endeavor for the architects. Despite their ambitious goals, the architects had to contend with various obstacles that posed significant threats to the safety and success of their dirigibles."
1333	16166	6	3	In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges. The use of hydrogen in dirigibles, known for its high flammability, posed a significant risk. The 1937 Hindenburg disaster served as a tragic reminder of the dangers associated with hydrogen-filled airships. A potential fire while docking at the Empire State Building could result in a catastrophic crash, endangering the lives of those below. Additionally, the high winds at the estimated altitude of 1,250 feet presented another obstacle. These strong winds could destabilize the dirigible during docking, potentially causing damage to the building and risking the safety of surrounding structures. The possibility of a dirigible colliding with other buildings and puncturing the gas-containing fabric further added to the safety concerns. Ultimately, due to the high level of risk involved, the project of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was deemed too dangerous to pursue.
1334	16167	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was they weren't sure if the structure of the building could hold up to a swaying dirigible. Additionally, the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast. Moreover, there was a law enforcement against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. These challenges made it difficult for the builders to successfully incorporate a dirigible docking system into the Empire State Building.
1335	16168	6	3	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the world, surpassing the new Chrysler Building. However, when a 200-foot tall spire was added to the top of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building was at risk of coming in second. To address this, Al Smith decided to add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles, increasing the height by another 250 feet. Smith had to strengthen the building frame to support a floating blimp more than 1,200 feet above the ground. Despite facing challenges like harsh winds at the top of the building, the dirigible idea was ultimately abandoned. Nevertheless, Al Smith's tower achieved its goal of becoming the world's tallest building.
1336	16169	6	3	"Throughout the process of construction the Empire State Building contractors faced couple of obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it. First off, safety was a huge factor of the quest. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York."" Though a balloon and dirigible may have the same appearance, the two are completely structured differently. Helium causes a balloon to rise, while a dirigible uses hydrogen to fly, which is highly flammable. Secondly, there was already a law put into effect for air traffic. ""... could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the shell."" If the dirigible was to ever get punctured, it could collapse into the streets of New York causing mass destruction. Thus, these were a few of many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
1337	16170	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous challenges during its construction, including the need to accommodate a dirigible mast within the building. To address this requirement, the builders designed a rocket-shaped mast that could house the dirigible in the building's shaft. This innovative solution also included elevators that allowed people to travel down to the lobby. As a result of these design considerations, the building ultimately reached a height of 102 floors. Additionally, a glass observation room was installed on the 101st floor, providing visitors with stunning panoramic views of the city. Despite the obstacles faced during its construction, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance.
1338	16171	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire over New York City, the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building, the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting, and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, making it a challenging task to overcome.
1339	16172	6	3	The mooring mast at the Empire State Building seemed like a great idea for accommodating dirigibles, but it faced several challenges. The owners were concerned about the potential risks after the Hindenburg disaster, realizing the dangers of such an incident above a densely populated area. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas, making it illegal for them to approach or tie up to the building. Furthermore, the violent and unpredictable winds on top of the building made it difficult for a dirigible to be tethered securely, causing the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Ultimately, the mooring mast idea, once promising, turned out to be impractical and unfeasible due to these various obstacles.
1340	16173	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph @NUM1 the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas, which is found in paragraph @NUM4. By a dirigible docking it would be directly breaking the law. Additionally, the sheer size and weight of the dirigibles would have posed a challenge in terms of stability and structural integrity when attempting to dock on top of the Empire State Building. Overall, the vision of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible dock was ultimately not feasible due to a combination of safety concerns, technical challenges, and legal restrictions.
1341	16174	6	3	"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped.  The risks and impracticalities associated with docking dirigibles, such as the Hindenburg disaster, the challenges of supplying lead weights, the difficulties in modifying buildings for docking, the instability caused by high-altitude winds, and the advancement of airplanes overshadowing blimps in speed and capacity, all contributed to the conclusion that dirigibles were not a viable option for transportation in New York City."
1342	16175	6	3	"The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe. The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building."
1343	16176	6	3	The Empire State Building, originally intended to be just slightly taller than the Chrysler Building, underwent a transformation to reach a new height of 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. However, an ambitious addition of a mooring mast for zeppelins by Al Smith, Governor of New York, posed significant dangers. The foundation's instability, the risk of zeppelins veering out of control and crashing into the building, and the potential for explosions due to the hydrogen in the zeppelins all pointed towards a calamitous outcome. The ill-fated decision to include a mooring mast at the pinnacle of the Empire State Building was a disaster waiting to happen, overshadowing its impressive height and architectural grandeur.
1344	16177	6	3	The steel skeleton of the mast had to be capable of withstanding winds up to 200 miles per hour. This required further adjustments to the building's structure, adding to the already substantial cost of modifications. Despite the challenges faced by the builders, they persevered in their efforts to enable the docking of dirigibles at the top of the building. Through careful planning and innovative engineering solutions, they were able to overcome these obstacles and create a unique docking space that would leave a mark on the history of architecture.
1345	16178	6	3	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The first reason is the law against flying airships too low over the Empire State Building, making it challenging to do so. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in some dirigibles, which is flammable, raised concerns about safety. The destruction of a German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, highlighted the potential dangers of such an incident occurring in a densely populated area like downtown New York City. Furthermore, the idea of using lead weights to hold the dirigibles down was deemed impractical and unsafe. Ultimately, while docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building may have seemed like a convenient solution, the risks and safety concerns involved made it a much safer choice to avoid such operations.
1346	16179	6	3	"THE BUILDERS OBSTACLE IN LETTING DIRIGIBLES DOCK AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING WAS A LOT. FOR ONE, THE MOORING MAST WOULD ADD STRESS TO THE BUILDING'S FRAME, THE WEIGHT OF THE DIRIGIBLES AND WIND PRESSURE WOULD BE TRANSMITTED TO THE BUILDING'S FOUNDATION. ""WINDS WERE SHIFTING DUE TO VIOLENT AIR CURRENTS"". ""EVEN IF THE DIRIGIBLES WERE TETHERED TO THE MAST, THE BACK OF THE SHIPS WOULD SWIVEL AROUND."" AND ALSO, THE LAW THAT AIRSHIPS CAN'T FLY LOW IN URBAN AREAS. Additionally, the height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for the docking of dirigibles, as the structure's elevation made it difficult for airships to safely approach and dock without risking collisions or other accidents. Furthermore, the limited space at the top of the building would have made it challenging for dirigibles to maneuver and dock effectively, increasing the likelihood of potential damage to both the airships and the building itself. Overall, these obstacles made it impractical for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, leading to the eventual abandonment of the idea."
1347	16180	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to attach a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Harsh winds could render the mast unstable, posing a significant risk to any dirigible attempting to dock. Additionally, a law stating dirigibles could not fly under a certain altitude presented a challenge as the set altitude was higher than the building's height. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to safely approach the mooring mast. Safety concerns also played a crucial role in the decision-making process. Some blimps are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and the potential for a blimp fire over a densely populated area would be devastating. Despite being an ingenious idea, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building ultimately faced too many obstacles to be implemented successfully.
1348	16181	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were primarily related to safety concerns. The use of highly flammable hydrogen in many dirigibles, as seen in the Hindenburg disaster, posed a significant risk in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Additionally, the natural movement of dirigibles when tethered to the mooring mast presented challenges, as they would swivel around the mast and potentially cause damage. Furthermore, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to approach or dock at the Empire State Building. These factors combined to make it impractical and unsafe for dirigibles to use the building as a docking station.
1349	16182	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety and nature were the two main challenges they encountered during the construction process. The builders should have realized the potential safety hazards before proceeding with the project. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of the safer option, helium. An accident involving a hydrogen-filled dirigible over densely populated New York would have had catastrophic consequences.   In addition to safety concerns, nature posed a significant obstacle for the builders. The violent air currents at the top of the building caused constantly shifting winds, making it difficult for airships to navigate and dock safely. This would result in the back of the ship swiveling around the mooring mast, posing a risk to both the airship and the building.   Furthermore, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to tie a dirigible to the Empire State Building. These obstacles made it clear that using the building as a docking station for airships was not a feasible or safe option. Ultimately, the builders had to find alternative solutions to address these challenges and ensure the safety of the iconic skyscraper.
1350	16183	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. Their goal was to build a moor on top of the building in order for dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. In the end they were not successful. One obstacle was ""lack of a suitable landing area."" Without this, the dock would not work. Another main obstacle is the safety reason. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly fammable."" They could easily catch on fire and harm many innocent people. Which leads to two other reasons. ""Nature itself."" That could easily start a fire with the wind. ""Existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The dirigibles could harm innocent people. Many other obstacles were found so this plan failed. The challenges faced by the builders, including safety concerns, lack of suitable landing areas, potential fire hazards, and legal restrictions, ultimately prevented the successful implementation of the mooring mast on the Empire State building."
1351	16184	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, someone attempted a publicity stunt where they would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The workers moring equipment had never been installed because, putting the workers having to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp in great danger. Also, the wind at the top of the building put workers at great risk of falling off or dying. These challenges made it clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a feasible or safe option.
1352	16185	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when attempting to let dirigibles dock there. There were major obstacles in the dirigibles themselves, the unpredictable winds in New York, and new laws restricting airship operations.  Dirigibles, unlike balloons filled with helium, were filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas. This posed a significant risk in a densely populated city like New York, where any accident could have catastrophic consequences.  The ever-shifting winds around New York made it difficult to secure the dirigibles for docking. While the idea of using lead to anchor them was considered, the potential danger of the heavy metal falling and causing harm to people below was a major concern.  Moreover, a recent law had been passed restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This legal limitation could have made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building if the regulations were strictly enforced.  In conclusion, the architects and builders faced significant challenges and considerations that needed to be addressed before attempting to accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State building.
1353	16186	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their quest to allow dirigibles to dock there. In a fierce competition to construct the world's tallest building, they were under immense pressure to succeed. The architects had to make significant modifications to the building's framework, costing over sixty thousand dollars, to accommodate the mast for the dirigibles. It was crucial to ensure that the stress of the dirigibles' load and wind pressure could be safely transmitted to the building's foundation without compromising its structural integrity. Additionally, the architects had to consider the safety risks associated with dirigibles, as they were highly flammable and posed a significant danger to the city if an accident were to occur. Moreover, there were strict laws prohibiting airships from flying low in urban areas, further complicating the builders' task. Despite these challenges, the builders and architects persevered in their efforts to overcome these obstacles and realize their vision of constructing the tallest building in the world.
1354	16187	6	3	The main obstacle was to be the tallest building in the world. That all changed to being able to have a mooring mast so blimps can land on it to drop off/pick up passengers and refuel. They had thousands of dollars in renovations to sturdy the structure of the tower. They couldn't make the foundations sturdy enough to hold the weight of an @NUM2 foot ship + cargo. After extensive efforts and investments, the construction team successfully reinforced the tower's foundation to accommodate the weight of the blimps, allowing for smooth landings and take-offs for passenger transport and refueling operations.
1355	16188	6	3	The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. Although the mast was finished due to @CAPS1 Nature a new law no dirigibles has ever docked at the Empire State Building.
1356	16189	6	3	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium which is highly flamable. The owners realized the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used.  Despite the challenges faced in the construction of the mooring mast, the decision not to proceed with its full purpose was a wise choice. The structural, safety, and environmental obstacles presented significant risks that could have had catastrophic consequences. By reevaluating the feasibility of the project, the builders prioritized the safety of the city and its inhabitants. Ultimately, the decision to abandon the construction of the mooring mast was a responsible one, ensuring that potential dangers were avoided and blimps were used with caution in the future."
1357	16190	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the strength of the buildings frame, Nature, and certain laws against it. A big problem with building a landing for the dirigibles on the empire state building was the strength of the base. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to get past was the element of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire state building were always changing due to violent air currents. A dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the potential of wrapping around the mooring mast in the unpredictable winds. The workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking. The last obstacle that the workers had to get past was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" All of these obstacles proved to be too much for the workers to handle as the mooring mast on top of the empire State building was never created. Ultimately, the challenges presented by the building's structure, nature's unpredictability, and legal restrictions made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1358	16191	6	3	The Empire State Building, a great symbol of the United States, was originally intended to have a mooring dock for dirigibles at its summit. However, this plan never came to fruition due to poor environmental and safety conditions. The high wind currents at such altitudes posed a risk, and tethering a blimp to the building could strain its frame. Additionally, there was no practical way to secure the balloon without endangering civilians below. Ultimately, the idea of using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for airships was unrealistic and unattainable.
1359	16192	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, it talks about the Hindenburg bursting into flames over New Jersey and how much more dangerous it would have been over highly-populated areas such as New York. The tragic incident with the Hindenburg serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks involved in allowing dirigibles to dock in urban areas. If a similar disaster were to occur over a bustling city like New York, the consequences could be catastrophic. The builders had to carefully consider these dangers and implement necessary safety measures to mitigate the risks associated with dirigible docking at the Empire State Building. By addressing these challenges, they were able to create a space that was both functional and safe for airship operations.
1360	16193	6	3	During any type of construction, the builders face some type of obstacles, as do the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State building is the high flammability they have. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be. Ultimately, the challenges posed by the flammability of dirigibles, the unpredictable nature of air currents, and existing laws prohibiting low flying over urban areas made docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1361	16194	6	3	"In ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Lusted, builders faced unforeseen problems when trying to enable dirigibles to tie up to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building. The variations in blimps, safety concerns, and legal restrictions were major challenges that the builders had not anticipated. Blimps from different countries used different gases, with some using flammable hydrogen, posing a serious risk in densely populated areas like New York. The high winds at the top of the building also presented safety issues, potentially causing collisions with the mast. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock on the building. These overlooked factors would later prove to be significant obstacles for the builders, highlighting the importance of thorough planning and consideration in construction projects."
1362	16195	6	3	The Empire State Building was constructed in order to rival the Chrysler Building, which led to the addition of a mooring mast. However, several obstacles hindered the ability of dirigibles to utilize this feature. One such challenge was the unpredictable nature of the wind at the building's peak, making it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock. Additionally, some dirigibles carried a significant amount of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, further complicating the mooring process. Furthermore, regulations prohibiting aircraft from flying at low altitudes over urban areas also restricted the use of the mooring mast at the Empire State Building. These various factors combined to create significant limitations for dirigibles seeking to moor at this iconic skyscraper.
1363	16196	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the challenges of creating a Mooring mast on top of a 1,250 foot tall building are discussed. In the 1930's Al Smith, the governor at the time had the idea of making the Empire State Building equipped with its own landing dock for Dirigibles. Throughout the process, the builders were faced with many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle was getting the mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" If the builders did do that it would cause too much stress to the building. The problem was solved after spending over $500,000 on a steel frame to support the mast. However, most of the builders' problems were not able to be solved. Safety was a major issue, as most dirigibles were built with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. It would be a huge problem if a fire occurred over a densely populated area. Also, the dirigibles would be too high up to be tied down. Additionally, if the dirigibles did land there, it would be in violation of an existing law. Therefore, the builders were faced with so many obstacles they were unable to build the mast. Ultimately, the challenges and safety concerns proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the project."
1364	16197	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought."
1365	16198	6	3	"The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, drove him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task which lay ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects knew they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced with how to adjust the frame of the building to support the docking site. The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1). They were able to overcome this obstacle but many more loomed up ahead. The wind and weather needed to be taken into consideration as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" (par. @NUM2). Reluctantly the builders admitted to the inevitable obstacle posed by nature. The builders seems to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densely populated city was an all-around dangerous idea. It was noticed that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @NUM3) and a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this. They realized that ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM4). The impossibility of the plan was realized for there were too many obstacles to face. The builders gave up hope but the moorings still looms atop the Empire State Building as a reminder of what could have been. Ultimately, the vision of a dirigible docking site on the Empire State Building was thwarted by the insurmountable challenges posed by structural, environmental, safety, and legal obstacles."
1366	16199	6	3	"The early @DATE1's was a time where everyone was out to find and build the next best thing. In @CAPS1, two tycoons were competing to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man creating the Empire State building, had an idea to make his building taller and more popular; build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though a good and creative idea, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be more than they bargained for.  First off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was very impractical without changing the whole design. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Also, the dirigible would put so much stress on the foundation of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...,"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Nature was also a giant obstacle these architects faced while building this. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" (@CAPS2 @NUM3).  In conclusion, the challenges faced by the architects in building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building proved to be too great to overcome, leading to the ultimate failure of the project. Despite the innovative idea, practical limitations and natural forces ultimately prevented its successful implementation."
1367	16200	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are, The govenment people in Washington was think about some safe way of mooring airships of the mast. He never wanted to reach the top cause he don't want an accident to happen and than something happen. The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The weights of the build, it would be dangling high above pedestrian on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. It was also a law. Additionally, the builder had to consider the potential risks and dangers of having dirigibles docking at such a height, as any accident could have catastrophic consequences for both the airships and the people below. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the building needed to be taken into account, as adding a docking station for dirigibles would require significant modifications and reinforcements to ensure safety. Ultimately, the challenges and considerations involved in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building proved to be insurmountable, leading to the decision to abandon the idea altogether.
1368	16201	6	3	In order to dock these dirigibles, the builders would face many serious problems. The building frame was too weak to be tied to a dirigible, as it would add stress that could be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This issue required over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the frame. Additionally, the dirigibles were in a city, where laws prohibited flying too low over urban areas, let alone tying up to a building. This forced the builders to design a way for the dirigibles to dock without violating regulations. Moreover, violent air currents posed a challenge, necessitating the construction of mooring equipment capable of withstanding nature's wrath. Overall, these obstacles demanded innovative solutions and significant investments to make the docking of dirigibles a reality.
1369	16202	6	3	Right from the start, the Empire State Building had architectural demands that posed several obstacles for the builders of it, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for dirigibles. Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons. Additionally, the weight of the dirigibles could have caused structural issues and compromised the overall stability of the building. Furthermore, the technology for safely docking and releasing dirigibles was not yet advanced enough to guarantee the safety of passengers and bystanders. Ultimately, the decision to include a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was impractical and posed too many risks, leading to its ultimate abandonment as a functional feature of the iconic skyscraper.
1370	16203	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to make a mooring mast for dirigibles. The first obstacle was creating the mooring mast. In paragraph four it says, ""This dream of the aviation pioneers was to travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships."" The Empire State Building's frame wasn't strong enough for the mooring mast, so the builders had to modify it. In paragraph nine they say, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" An obstacle that stopped the use of the mooring mast was the wind. In paragraph fifteen they were not able to dock, ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Another obstacle they faced was safety. In paragraph seventeen they describe that, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" There were problems that the builders could fix and couldn't fix, such as the structural modifications and the uncontrollable wind conditions. Despite their efforts, the mooring mast project ultimately proved unsuccessful due to these challenges."
1371	16204	6	3	The builders also had to consider the weight of the blimp and how it would affect the structure of the building. They needed to ensure that the foundation and support beams could withstand the added pressure. Additionally, the builders had to take into account the logistics of docking and undocking the blimp, making sure that there was enough space for maneuvering without causing damage to the building or the blimp itself. Despite these challenges, the builders were able to overcome them through careful planning and innovative engineering solutions. In the end, the completed building stood as a testament to their perseverance and ingenuity in the face of adversity.
1372	16205	6	3	Some of the obstacles that the builders faced while allowing dirigibles to dock there would be that they had a lack of suitable landing area. One of the main obstacles that occurred would be nature. The shifting of the air currents were constantly changing, making it difficult for dirigibles to navigate and dock safely. Additionally, the back of the ship was constantly shifting, creating further challenges for the builders. These obstacles made it a complex task to establish a docking area for dirigibles, requiring careful planning and innovative solutions to overcome the natural elements.
1373	16206	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building made it possible for dirigibles to dock on the top of the building because it made the building a lot bigger than it was. It lost its position as the biggest and then got it back by creating the dock for dirigibles (Blimps). This innovative feature not only added to the grandeur of the building but also served a practical purpose, allowing for airship docking which was a popular mode of transportation at the time. This unique addition helped solidify the Empire State Building's status as an iconic landmark in New York City.
1374	16207	6	3	In The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State building faced problems trying to dock the dirigibles. One major obstacle was the safety hazard posed by the dirigibles, particularly those using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This increased the risk of a fire breaking out while the dirigibles were docked in the densely populated area around the building. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the winds on top of the building, affected by violent air currents, made it difficult for the dirigibles to stay stable while attempting to dock. These challenges ultimately prevented the builders from successfully docking a dirigible at the Empire State building.
1375	16208	6	3	In the building of the mast that was to be used to dock and refuel dirigibles, the builders and architect faced many daunting problems. For one thing, a simple mooring mast could not be placed on the roof of the Empire State Building, as it would add too much stress to the building's framework and potentially cause a collapse due to immense wind power. Additionally, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium to inflate their airships, making them highly flammable. Moreover, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas.  One of the final and most important challenges faced by the builders was the constantly shifting wind patterns caused by violent air currents. Even with the dirigibles tethered to the mooring mast, the back end would swivel around the mast in response to the wind. These obstacles posed significant challenges in the construction and operation of the mast for docking and refueling dirigibles.
1376	16209	6	3	There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the stress the dirigible would add to the building. Over sixty thousand dollars modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also, most dirigibles contained hydrogen which is highly flammable and dangerous. Another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above pedestrians, as opposed to their much safer usual landing of open fields. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause docking issues. These challenges made it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complex considerations involved in integrating aerial transportation with urban infrastructure.
1377	16210	6	3	The biggest obstacle was safety. The foreign dirigibles use Hydrogen gas as a means to fly but hydrogen gas is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building were concerned because of what happened to the German dirigible, Hindenburg, over Lakehurst. The Hindenburg burst into flames and in less than one minute there was no dirigible, just some charred scrap metal. If this incident were to happen in a highly populated area like downtown New York City it would create a high number of casualties and fatalities. Therefore, ensuring the safe operation of these dirigibles in such a densely populated area was a significant challenge that needed to be addressed carefully.
1378	16211	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because of ""nature itself"" and the past problems that happened. An obstacle that the builders faced was providing safety. After the fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, the builders were worried about the issues that might occur, especially when it takes place in downtown New York. Another obstacle was ""nature itself."" Because of the mooring mast being on top of the building, the builders were frightened because of the violent air currents. The last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So it was illegal for an airship to be tied on a building. The builders faced three main obstacles - ""Nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law. Unfortunately, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong. Despite their efforts, the challenges of safety concerns, natural elements, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the builders from achieving their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building."
1379	16212	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been a unique concept, but it was ultimately abandoned due to various obstacles. Safety concerns such as the risk of fire and difficulties in stabilizing the blimps posed significant challenges. The unpredictable nature of the wind made it difficult to keep the dirigibles in place, leading to concerns about the feasibility of the project. Additionally, existing laws prohibited ships from tying up to the building, further complicating the situation. While the idea had the potential to revolutionize travel, the numerous safety violations and legal barriers ultimately made it impractical to pursue. In the end, the masting moor of the Empire State Building presented too many obstacles for the docking of dirigibles to become a reality.
1380	16213	6	3	"While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State building, the builders had some problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were too strong to fly a dirigible in, one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers."" Flying so close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" The only way to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently was to put large lead weights on it, but that would not be practical over New York. In conclusion, docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was too difficult and it never happened."
1381	16214	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges during its construction, particularly in competition with the Chrysler Building's height. Al Smith, the project's leader, aimed to create the tallest and most iconic building globally, ensuring its invincibility. Despite including a mooring mast for publicity purposes, the building was not intended for actual use due to safety concerns. Smith's dedication and strategic decisions played a crucial role in the Empire State Building's enduring popularity, solidifying its status as a landmark in New York City.
1382	16215	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there. One is that the weight of the zeppelin, when tied down to the building, would put immense pressure on the framework and the pressure even would have reached the foundation. The cost of reworking the frame work to make it safer would have been @MONEY1. Another obstacle was public expectations. The Building was supposed to change how we travel forever, all while being a beautiful, magnificent structure. Surely the pressure to build the tallest tower in the world got to them. These expectations were so unreal because most people didn't know enough to understand the safety risk involved.
1383	16216	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in designing and constructing the mooring mast for dirigibles. They had to carefully plan for the thousand-foot dirigible that would be docking at the top of the building, considering factors such as wind pressure and the weight of the aircraft. To address these challenges, the builders came up with innovative ideas, such as creating a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on top of the building. Additionally, they had to design elevators and stairs to transport passengers from the dirigible to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and tickets would be located. Despite the obstacles they faced, the builders persevered and successfully completed the construction of the mooring mast.
1384	16217	6	3	"The Empire State Building at the time it was being built was designed to be the tallest building in the world. However, this was not an easy task. The workers had one especially difficult obstacle to overcome, dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building which would allow dirigibles to dock. If this could be achieved, it was said to make the Empire State Building ""equipped for an age of transportation."" However, many problems occurred. The dirigibles' weight would have to be able to be held safely. The architects knew the weight would put stress on the building's frame. The workers had to modify and strengthen the building's framework. The workers also built the mast out of a strong, shiny, chrome-nickel. Another obstacle was faced when the mast was taken into consideration. The framework was originally stopped at the eighty-fifth floor. The workers had to finish the roof before the mast could be framed. Although the workers succeeded in making a safe mast, the ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" never came to be. Ultimately, the Empire State Building stood tall as an architectural marvel, but the dream of dirigibles docking at its mast was never realized."
1385	16218	6	3	"Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building so that dirigibles could anchor there for refueling or service and let people on and off. In order to do this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars in modifications of the framework. Builders had to make it 102 floors and also create a glassed-in observation area along with an open observation platform, furthermore, they had to complete the roof and then move on to building the steel mast with glass windows. After all that time and money spent in re-creating the building, the dirigibles couldn't dock there. The wind was so strong that the back of the ship would always be moving. Also, there is a law that airships cant fly too low over urban areas. It wasn't worth it in the end. Ultimately, the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building fell through due to technical and regulatory challenges, despite the significant time and financial investment made in modifying the building."
1386	16219	6	3	"Due to Several factors the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One serious obstacle was that the dirigible moored at the top of the build held only by a tether would stress the buildings frame. In paragraph nine it says ""the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework.""Another complication was nature itself. Above the city were strong winds which were constantly shifting due to air currents. This made it impossible to dock. As well as nature working against the mooring mast so was the law. In paragraph fifteen it says ""on existing law against airships flying too low over low urban areas."" Which made it illegal for an airship to ever tie up the the Empire State Building. Furthermore, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely navigate and dock at such a tall structure. The potential risks and dangers involved in attempting to dock a dirigible at such heights were a major concern for both the building's management and the dirigible operators. Despite the initial excitement and ambition surrounding the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building, practical limitations and safety considerations ultimately prevented this vision from becoming a reality."
1387	16220	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when it came to the idea of dirigibles landing on top of the building. One major concern was the stress it would put on the building's frame if a thousand-foot dirigible was tethered to it. Additionally, it became evident that the mooring mast that had been constructed was not suitable for its intended purpose, as it would not have worked due to various factors. The violent air currents and shifting winds at the top of the building further complicated the situation, making it clear that the mooring mast was destined for failure. Ultimately, the unsafe conditions for planes, the flammability of hydrogen in dirigibles, and the challenges posed by the wind all contributed to the unsuccessful implementation of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1388	16221	6	3	The architects faced challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building due to structural limitations. Simply dropping a mooring mast on the flat roof was not feasible as it would stress the building's frame. The load of a thousand-foot dirigible and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. This presented a significant obstacle in the construction and design of the docking mechanism.
1389	16222	6	3	When the Empire State Building was constructed, the architects had a vision of turning it into a docking station for blimps. However, this idea faced several challenges that made it unfeasible. Firstly, attaching a dock for a blimp to the building without compromising its structural integrity required significant and costly framework strengthening. Additionally, the strong winds at the top of the building would cause the blimps to sway violently, posing a safety risk for pilots trying to dock. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited aircraft from flying at such low altitudes, making it illegal to approach the building for docking. Ultimately, these obstacles prevented the Empire State Building from fulfilling its intended purpose as a blimp dock.
1390	16223	6	3	The difficulties of building a mooring dock atop the Empire State Building were numerous. Structural stability was a significant concern, as the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause stress on the building's frame. Controlling the dirigible during docking was also a challenge due to the violent and frequent wind shifts above the building. Safety was paramount, especially following the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, where a German zeppelin caught fire and exploded. These obstacles made the idea of a mooring dock on the Empire State Building not only complex but also potentially dangerous.
1391	16224	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building were building a mast, dirigibles docking on top of the building, and a law for dirigibles. The architects and builders spend a lot of time building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles were trying to figure out how to dock to the building yet most dirigibles failed. A law the dirigibles were unable to dock on urban areas in case of a problem within the dirigibles. These were the obstacles the builders faced in an attempt to create a mast and allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. Despite their efforts, the challenges of constructing a suitable mooring mast and finding a safe way for dirigibles to dock ultimately proved too difficult to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the project.
1392	16225	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building included safety concerns and time constraints. The height of the building posed safety risks, as it was difficult to lift heavy glass and steel parts to the top without endangering workers or people below. Additionally, the presence of blimps flying too close to the building created a hazard, necessitating careful planning to prevent accidents. The limited time available for construction added pressure to the project, requiring efficient and effective work to meet deadlines. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic Empire State Building.
1393	16226	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had a real hard time with the construction of the mooring mast. They had to deal with the framework of the building. A big obstacle they had was that they didn't have a suitable landing area for the dirigibles. They didn't just have to deal with man-made obstacles, but nature's challenges as well. The wind on the top of the building made it nearly impossible to land safely. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (Harris, 2021). The constructors of the building realized that to make this plan possible they would have to redo the frame of the building. The building wasn't even designed to be able to allow dirigibles to land on the top of the building. The workers were blind to see all the possible problems with the design of the mooring mast. The obstacles the workers had to go through were too much, and the landing of the dirigibles never worked. Ultimately, the challenges proved insurmountable, and the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned."
1394	16227	6	3	To allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, builders would have faced tough obstacles. One major challenge was the rapid advancement of technology in the 1930s, particularly with the development of airplanes. As mentioned in the text, the problem of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height was a significant concern, leading to the decision to delay the installation of landing gear. This indicates that technology for safely landing Dirigibles had already been developed, but further testing was needed to ensure the effectiveness of the mast. However, it was later discovered that placing a dirigible on top of a mast would pose safety risks due to potential wind disturbances that could cause the airship to crash into the building. Ultimately, the idea of docking Dirigibles on the Empire State Building was deemed impractical and unsafe, highlighting the importance of considering all potential obstacles and safety concerns in architectural designs.
1395	16228	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their quest to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the stress that the single cable tether would place on the building's frame. This necessitated the development of a new solution to prevent structural damage. Additionally, concerns about the safety of passengers arose due to the height of the building, with fears of potential falls from the dirigible. Moreover, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas presented a legal obstacle, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to construct a mooring mast that would facilitate dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1396	16229	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The first obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified. The excerpt says, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle was safety. After the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, builders realized how bad the devastation would be if that happened over densely populated New York City. Nature was also a large obstacle. Shifting air currents at the top of the building would make the dirigible very unstable. It would be dangerous to have an unstable dirigible hanging above crowded city streets. Finally, at the time there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles are were the architects of the Empire State Building from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1397	16230	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by one single cable tether, would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, to the building's foundation. This, in turn, means that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the Empire State Building to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made. As construction proceeded, once the framing had been completed up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The modifications and adjustments were crucial to ensure the structural integrity and safety of the building for the unique feature of dirigible docking.
1398	16231	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature, and the law. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. Since blimps needed to be lighter than air, most are filled with helium or hydrogen. Most dirigibles from outside the US used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This posed a significant risk, as a fire could have catastrophic consequences if a blimp caught on fire while docking. Another obstacle was nature, as violent air currents caused the building to sway. This movement could potentially collide with a docking blimp, posing a danger to both the dirigible and the building. Additionally, the law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach the building closely. These obstacles made it challenging for builders to create a safe and legal docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1399	16232	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to dock dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. One major challenge was the issue of wind, as it could affect the building's structure when the dirigibles were tied down. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, located nearly eleven hundred feet below. This necessitated costly changes to the building's design.  In addition to wind concerns, there were legal obstacles to consider. Existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, which meant that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not permitted. These regulations posed another significant challenge for the architects.  Despite these obstacles, the architects continued to explore ways to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality. Overcoming the challenges of wind, structural modifications, and legal restrictions required innovative solutions and careful planning. Despite the setbacks, the architects remained determined to find a way to make their vision a reality.
1400	16233	6	3	First of all, the Empire State Building wasn't made for landing dirigibles on top of it. The architects had to redesign the whole top of the building. When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles. It was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over @NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible.
1401	16234	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they faced was having to build the mooring mast because without it the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Even though the builders made the mooring mast, it was too unsafe to moor dirigibles from the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" In all, the builders were faced with too many obstacles and could not manage to moor the dirigibles to the building."
1402	16235	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety concerns, existing laws, and the challenges posed by air currents. One major safety issue was the flammability of hydrogen, which many dirigibles used instead of helium. The potential danger of a fire breaking out above a densely populated area was a significant risk that the owners could not ignore. Furthermore, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for dirigibles to safely approach the building for docking. Additionally, the unpredictable shift in air currents at the top of the building posed a serious risk to both pedestrians on the streets below and passengers boarding or disembarking from the dirigibles. The combination of these practical obstacles ultimately led to the decision to abandon the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1403	16236	6	3	The obstacles that the Empire State Building faced were significant. In order to accommodate dirigibles, or blimps, they needed to build additional floors for loading and unloading. This required the construction of steel frames from the 85th floor to the 102nd floor, costing over $1 million for necessary modifications to the building's framework. These challenges had to be overcome to make the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible docking.
1404	16237	6	3	@CAPS2 The architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the inability to simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof, as it would stress the building and require modifications to the steel frame for added strength. Safety concerns also arose due to the flammability of hydrogen, often used in dirigibles from outside the United States. However, the architects' greatest obstacle proved to be nature itself, as the shifting winds and violent air currents at the building's peak caused the moored dirigibles to spin uncontrollably around the mast. These obstacles presented significant challenges that required innovative solutions to overcome.
1405	16238	6	3	To dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building, a suitable dock site was necessary. However, the high winds at such heights would pose a significant challenge for the dirigible to remain securely docked. Furthermore, the flammability of the dirigible would present a serious risk to the safety of those below. These obstacles made it clear that docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
1406	16239	6	3	"In this fascinating story ""The Mooring Mast"" written by author Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building's immense size and the challenges faced in constructing the mooring mast are highlighted. The workers dedicated their time and effort to building the structure, but they struggled to understand the purpose of the mooring mast. One significant issue was the use of helium instead of hydrogen in dirigibles, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Docking a dirigible at the building could have resulted in a tragic event due to the risk of fire. Additionally, dirigibles typically landed in open fields where they could be securely anchored, which was not feasible at a busy urban location like the Empire State Building. The author, Marcia, points out that hanging dirigibles high above city streets was neither practical nor safe. These challenges made it difficult for workers to successfully construct the mooring mast, showcasing the complexity of the project."
1407	16240	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the unpredictable winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, making it difficult for dirigibles to safely land. Additionally, a law prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, further complicating the docking process. As a result, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not utilized for airship landings due to safety concerns. However, the structure found other practical uses in ensuring the safety and functionality of the iconic building.
1408	16241	6	3	In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros. Ultimately, the once promising idea of using dirigibles for transportation was overshadowed by safety concerns, structural limitations, and legal restrictions, leading to the conclusion that this mode of transportation was not as viable as initially thought.
1409	16242	6	3	In an attempt to build a dirigible destination in the Empire State Building, the architects faced challenges such as potential dirigible mishaps and natural elements. Problems like a blimp crash could result in costly damages, loss of lives in the densely populated city, and potential destruction of surrounding buildings, including the iconic Empire State Building. To prevent such disasters, the government had already implemented laws prohibiting flying aircraft from approaching urban areas too closely. The architects would have to navigate these laws and regulations to proceed with their plans, potentially bending rules or breaking them altogether. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of harsh winds could pose a significant threat to the stability of a dirigible docking station. The swaying of a blimp, even if tethered to a mooring mast, could lead to collisions with nearby buildings, putting civilians at risk. These challenges, coupled with the existing laws restricting such constructions, highlight the impracticality of realizing a dirigible docking station at the Empire State Building. It is evident that the idea is not feasible and should be reconsidered in light of the numerous obstacles and potential dangers involved.
1410	16243	6	3	"The Empire State Building, known as the world's tallest building, is located in New York. Al Smith, the head of its construction, added a distinctive top or ""hat"" to the building. The building was equipped for dirigible transportation, with a mooring mast at the top for docking airships. However, a major obstacle was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Despite the creative idea, the mooring mast was never used due to safety concerns. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, which posed a risk. Additionally, the urban environment of Downtown New York presented challenges in case of emergencies involving flames. Ultimately, the ambitious plan for airship transportation at the Empire State Building was never realized due to safety and practicality issues."
1411	16244	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders faced obstacles in making the building taller as they had to constantly go back to the base. This made the task more challenging for them.
1412	16245	6	3	Many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The obstacles included the public's safety, regulations that were already put in place, and the unpredictable weather. Many dirigibles use hydrogen gas which is very flammable. After the German Hindenburg went down it became apparent that the public's safety would be in danger from the vessels bursting into flame over crowded streets. At the time there were also regulations forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low. The final problem was the unpredictable weather. Pilots were worried the strong winds would blow the tethered vessel into another building or into sharp spires that would ruin the vessel and put the people below in danger. Many obstacles hindered the loading dock on the Empire State Building. Despite the challenges, the builders had to carefully consider each obstacle to ensure the safety of the public and the success of the dirigible landing dock project.
1413	16246	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were high wind currents and an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The violent air currents on top of the building made it unsafe for dirigibles to dock, as the shifting winds could cause the ships to sway dangerously. Additionally, the law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, preventing them from tying up to the building. The combination of these challenges made it difficult for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, despite attempts by airships like the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles. Ultimately, these obstacles presented significant barriers to the builders' goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper.
1414	16247	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at the Empire State Building for several hours, a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast, it could be completed and useful. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Nature presented challenges such as wind conditions and weather patterns that made dirigible docking a precarious endeavor. Despite these obstacles, the architects and builders persevered, creating a marvel of engineering that allowed dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building.
1415	16248	6	3	"After planning and building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the developers found many problems that were not thought of earlier. They hadn't considered the flammability of the gases inside the dirigibles, which posed a significant risk. Additionally, the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. Furthermore, the heavy winds at that height could be dangerous for the airships, as a collision with a neighboring building could have disastrous consequences. These unforeseen challenges highlighted the complexities of integrating airship docking facilities into urban landscapes and raised concerns about the safety of such ventures."
1416	16249	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem the builders faced was that a dirigible being moored to the top of the building would add stress to its frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below."" The builders had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to strengthen the frame of the building. Another major problem they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium."" Hydrogen is extremely flammable and after an incident with a German dirigible being destroyed, they realized how dangerous it would be over a densely populated area. Another reason was nature. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly moving."" This made it hard to tie up and keep the aircraft steady for passengers to get off safely. Even a navy pilot ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" There was even a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The mooring on top of the Empire State building was destined to fail because of all the obstacles that the builders faced. Ultimately, the challenges of structural stress, safety concerns, and unpredictable winds proved insurmountable in their efforts to establish dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1417	16250	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced various obstacles in their quest to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building. They had to redesign the building's top to accommodate the dirigibles, making it taller and more suitable for landing. Despite uncertainties about whether the dirigibles would fit, they persevered. Additionally, they had to design a mast specifically for the dirigibles, investing a significant amount of money into its construction. A stainless steel tower was also erected, featuring glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, further enhancing the docking capabilities. Despite the challenges faced, the builders dedicated themselves to the project. Ultimately, even though the dirigibles never had the opportunity to dock, the builders' hard work and perseverance should be commended. ""Take a bow, because it's over now."""
1418	16251	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including safety concerns, challenges posed by nature, and existing laws. One major safety concern was the flammability of hydrogen, a commonly used gas in dirigibles. The risk of an accident involving a dirigible filled with hydrogen docking on the Empire State Building could have disastrous consequences due to the densely populated nature of New York City. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building made it impractical and unsafe for dirigibles to land there. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. With all these obstacles in place, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was not a viable option.
1419	16252	6	3	While builders tried to figure out a way for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, they faced several obstacles. Hanging a dirigible from a single cable would place undue stress on the building's frame, requiring careful consideration. Additionally, the flat roof of the Empire State Building made it challenging to find a suitable docking point for the dirigibles. Weather conditions, such as violent air currents and shifting winds at the building's height, further complicated the feasibility of docking dirigibles. The instability caused by these factors posed a risk not only to the dirigibles but also to pedestrians on the ground. Overall, the planning and execution of a docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building presented a complex and multifaceted challenge for the builders.
1420	16253	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, nature, unsafe docking conditions, and pre-existing laws against dirigibles were just a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main obstacle ""to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". On the top of a building so high, the wind is always switching directions, causing the dirigible to ""swivel around"". Blimps or dirigibles typically landed in open fields and could be weighted down with lead weights, but using this technique ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe"". Moreover, the builders of the Empire State Building also encountered ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", making it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe, practical, nor legal due to these various challenges and restrictions."
1421	16254	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their quest to fulfill the construction of the Mooring Mast. Standing at a towering height of 1,454 feet, the building posed challenges due to the violent air currents at its summit. The unpredictable winds could potentially endanger the structural integrity of the support beams, making it unsafe for a Dirigible to dock. Additionally, the law prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, rendering any possibility of the Mooring Mast construction illegal. These factors combined to make the installation of a Dirigible docking station on the Empire State Building unfeasible and impractical.
1422	16255	6	3	"The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of make the dream of docking dirigibles, into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York are put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast. Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating that airships cannot fly too close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans of the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimpse of the future soon turned into nothing as @PERSON1 finally confronted the public in saying that the construction will be postponed. The future of transportation took a sharp blow, but with the new succession of the airplane, anything seemed possible. The challenges faced by Al Smith in attempting to bring the dream of docking dirigibles to reality highlight the complexities and limitations that can arise when envisioning the future of transportation. Despite the setbacks and obstacles encountered, the emergence of the airplane signified a new era in transportation, offering possibilities that seemed boundless and full of potential."
1423	16256	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous challenges during its construction due to its ambitious goal of becoming the world's largest building. Despite the hard work put into the project, it seemed like the building would never fulfill its intended purpose. This outcome should have been foreseen prior to its construction, highlighting the difficulties and obstacles that the project encountered along the way.
1424	16257	6	3	"Despite all hope and anticipation surrounding the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the project was never destined to be a success. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building. Ultimately, the mooring mast project was a bold but impractical idea that was unable to withstand the challenges it faced, leading to its eventual abandonment."
1425	16258	6	3	Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds, a weak structure, and public safety. The strong winds would make it difficult to hold the dirigibles steady at the top, while the weak structure would pose a safety risk for docking. These hazards would make it unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. As a result, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed too dangerous and impractical to pursue further.
1426	16259	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The foundation of the building would have been subjected to increased stress with a thousand-foot dirigible docking, as the load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Additionally, the danger posed by having dirigibles dock above the building was highlighted by the Hindenburg disaster, which could have been catastrophic if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Moreover, the strong and constantly shifting winds on the top of the building would have made docking a dirigible challenging, as the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. These obstacles made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building impractical and unlikely to be realized.
1427	16260	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon L¸sted, is informant on the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building. The issue was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. To fix this problem, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature. The winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions. This hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a problem. The final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the Empire State Building. The excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders. The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome challenges related to both the building's structure and the unpredictable nature of the winds at the building's height. Additionally, restrictions on airship flights over urban areas posed a significant obstacle to the possibility of dirigibles mooring on top of the iconic skyscraper. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and engineering prowess."
1428	16261	6	3	During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel framed  balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realzed how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there. The modifications made to the building's frame, the safety concerns over the flammability of hydrogen, and the structural integrity of the dirigibles were all challenges that needed to be overcome in order to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1429	16262	6	3	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would put stress on the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. These were the obstacles they had to overcome.
1430	16263	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included passengers on existing transatlantic routes and potential new routes that were yet to come. These passengers presented challenges in terms of demand for air travel and the need for infrastructure to accommodate them. As air travel continued to grow in popularity and efficiency, the Empire State Building had to adapt to the changing needs of passengers and the aviation industry. Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building were able to overcome obstacles and create a landmark that remains an iconic symbol of New York City today.
1431	16264	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some minor obstacles were the frame and strength of the building. Other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled. In paragraph nine the author explains that if a thousand-foot dirigibles were to be moored to the top of the Empire State Building it would add stress to the building's frame. Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen. Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight (which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas. Though the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing blimps to dock it still became a well known building in New York City.
1432	16265	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that inside the dirigibles were hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders did not want to risk any lives or damage any buildings. They realized how much worse an accident could be if it took place in downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was the wind on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to air currents. Also, dirigibles would be dangling over pedestrians on the streets below. The last reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for them to tie it up to the building or even approach it. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building presented challenges in terms of construction and logistics. The need for materials to be hoisted to such great heights was a significant challenge, requiring innovative solutions and machinery. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered and successfully completed the iconic skyscraper, a testament to human ingenuity and determination.
1433	16266	6	3	"When the architects behind the mooring Mast of the Empire State Building first began their work in designing it, they did not take into account the challenges they would have to overcome to dock a dirigible. In the excerpt it states that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building; however, the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This means that the builders would need to design some way of doing this when the building was already underway. Other concerns included those of safety. The excerpt tells us that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen,"" which is more flammable than helium. This combined with the fact that there really was no way of securing the tail of a dirigible moored at the mast could cause an accident similar to that of the Hindenburg over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The architects and builders had to carefully consider these factors to ensure the safety and functionality of the mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1434	16267	6	3	In addition to the safety concerns related to the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, there were also challenges posed by the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These violent air currents made it difficult for airships to safely approach and dock at the mooring mast. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over populated or urban areas, which limited the potential success of the mooring mast as a docking station for dirigibles. These obstacles combined to prevent the mooring mast from ever fulfilling its intended purpose, ultimately leading to its abandonment.
1435	16268	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is highlighted that there were significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to create a docking station for dirigibles. These obstacles included the highly flammable nature of dirigibles, the unsafe structure for human passengers, and the unpredictable winds around the building. The presence of hydrogen in the dirigibles made them a fire hazard, while laws prohibited aircraft from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for passengers to board the blimps. Additionally, the constantly shifting and violent air currents on top of the building posed a threat to the safety of individuals attempting to dock dirigibles. These obstacles created challenges for the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1436	16269	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A mooring mast, for docking dirigibles, would add stress to the building's frame and could not simply be dropped atop the Empire State Building. The building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Owners of the building realized that if an accident like the Hindenburg were to take place above a densely populated city or area such as downtown New York, the results would have been far worse. The builders' greatest obstacle would be nature itself. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the airship could tether to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. In addition, due to an existing law against airships flying too low, dirigibles could not legally moor at the Empire State Building. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to these challenges and limitations.
1437	16270	6	3	In addition to the financial cost and structural modifications required to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, another obstacle faced by the builders was the safety concerns associated with these airships. Dirigibles were known for being highly flammable, posing a significant risk to the surrounding buildings and people in the area. This safety issue had to be carefully considered and addressed before allowing dirigibles to dock at the building. These challenges highlight the complexities and considerations involved in incorporating such innovative transportation methods into a bustling urban landscape.
1438	16271	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A first obstacle they faced was the concern of the building collapsing over time with all the weight of the dirigibles. They would have to spend more money and time to create a frame for the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles. This concern was supported by the fact that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. Another obstacle the builders encountered was the safety of the thousands of citizens just below the tall building. After a German dirigible caught fire in Jersey, they realized the severity of the situation. The owners of the Empire State Building understood how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. These obstacles posed significant challenges for the builders in their efforts to make the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible docking.
1439	16272	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. Stress was a significant concern due to the immense pressure placed on the building's frame when a thousand-foot dirigible was moored at the top with a single tether cable. Safety was another obstacle, as the flammability of hydrogen, commonly used in dirigibles, posed a serious risk. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of winds at the building's height made it challenging for dirigibles to dock safely, even when tethered to the mooring mast. These obstacles presented formidable challenges for the builders, highlighting the complexities of integrating dirigible docking facilities into the Empire State Building.
1440	16273	6	3	When the empire state building was faced with a dirigible docking station they encountered many Problems. The first issue the city encountered was the wind. The wind over a thousand feet in the air is never going to be calm. Once they got the dirigible close to the tower there would be no way they could keep it still enough to refuel and let passengers on or off the dirigible. The second issue they ran into was that helium is flammable. If somehow that helium caught fire, it would be catastrophic in such a place as downtown New York. The third and final reason is that it is illegal to have an aircraft that low in a city. There was no way this was going to work out so they stopped moving forward on this project. Additionally, the weight of the dirigible could have put too much stress on the building's structure, risking damage or collapse. Moreover, the noise and disruption caused by the constant arrival and departure of dirigibles would have been highly disruptive to the surrounding area, affecting businesses and residents alike. In conclusion, the idea of a dirigible docking station at the Empire State Building was impractical and posed too many risks and challenges to be feasible.
1441	16274	6	3	The @ORGANIZATION1 spire was originally built to be more than just visually stimulating. The spire was actually intended to serve as a mooring mast for docking dirigibles, also known as blimps, in an effort to revolutionize transportation. Al Smith saw the potential to position the Empire State Building and New York at the forefront of modern travel by incorporating this innovative feature. However, the mast faced numerous challenges that needed to be addressed. To support and withstand the weight of a dirigible, the building's framework required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building posed a constant threat, making docking hazardous. Moreover, the highly flammable nature of most dirigibles raised concerns about public safety, especially in a densely populated area like downtown New York. A disaster involving a flammable dirigible above the city would have had catastrophic consequences. Ultimately, despite the ambitious plans, the obstacles surrounding the construction of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building proved insurmountable, highlighting the complexities and risks associated with early attempts at air travel innovation.
1442	16275	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to accommodate dirigibles for docking. Safety emerged as the most significant hurdle as dirigibles at the time utilized hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Given the close proximity of buildings in downtown New York, the risk of a fire spreading rapidly was a cause for concern. Moreover, the unpredictable and violent air currents at the building's peak posed a formidable obstacle. The constant shifting winds would have made it exceedingly difficult to secure a dirigible in place. Additionally, the presence of dirigibles hovering above busy streets and populated areas raised safety and regulatory issues. To add to the complications, a law was in place prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban spaces, rendering the entire plan illegal. Despite its potential benefits, the plan to moor dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately thwarted by these intricate challenges, highlighting the importance of thorough consideration and adherence to regulations in such ambitious endeavors."
1443	16276	6	3	The builders faced many problems trying to allow the dirigibles to dock. The biggest obstacle they had was the wind. At that elevation, the wind was constantly shifting. If the dirigible was tethered, the back would swivel. Another problem was that they could not weigh it down. Since it was elevated, if the dirigible was weighted down, it would fall. These were some of the obstacles the builders faced in their efforts to enable dirigibles to dock successfully.
1444	16277	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area, which required the design of a specific mast for the dirigibles. Additionally, the use of a single cable tether for the dirigibles added stress to the building's frame, necessitating over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. Another significant concern was the flammability of hydrogen, the gas used in most dirigibles from outside of the United States. The tragic incident involving the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" further highlighted the potential dangers of using hydrogen. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of violent wind and air currents posed a challenge in safely tethering the dirigibles to the mast. Ultimately, these obstacles collectively hindered the successful utilization of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building for dirigibles."
1445	16278	6	3	"There were several major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."". It cost over $1 million to make the modifications necessary to do this. Also, the, ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place."" However, they did not solve several other obstacles. Foreign dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" And this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivel around the mast. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end there were too many obstacles so the dirigible docking plan was scrapped."
1446	16279	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles that had to be faced was dealing with the hydrogen from dirigibles outside of the United States. The hydrogen was very flammable, and they would not be able to stand a fire in such a highly populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The winds from nature would make it hard to control the dirigible, so people were afraid of the dirigible crashing into the building. These were some of the obstacles that were faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1447	16280	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey it would have been more dangerous over a densey populated area like New York where the Empire State building was. the greatest obstacle to the success of the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were shifting due to air currents. Dirigibles would not be safe dangling high above pedestrians on the street. The major problem architect faced was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it has a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Even though it seemed like a good idea at the time, it was not practical or safe. Ultimately, the challenges posed by the unpredictable winds and safety regulations proved to be insurmountable obstacles in the goal of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles.
1448	16281	6	3	Obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Dealing with dirigibles that could be as long as one thousand feet proved to be a daunting task due to their massive size. The steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast, resulting in over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. Despite the efforts and expenses, the builders were ultimately unable to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1449	16282	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Because The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also because the Empire State Building have's an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it challenging to safely maneuver airships for docking purposes. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building remains an iconic symbol of New York City, showcasing the ingenuity and perseverance of its builders.
1450	16283	6	3	The builders were Building about 100 ft high Above surface, so Safety is an issue. Then a 20 ft Antenna would moore, at the top of Building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building (Antenna load would). Also, The Wind pressure would have to be transmitted 50 ft below to the foundation. So its a situation that could affect residents. The Antenna could catch on fire on top of Downtown New York hurting residents. And its costing a lot of money 1 million Dollars.
1451	16284	6	3	Allowing the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building took some obstacles. First, there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on.Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all. Despite these challenges, the modifications and precautions taken allowed dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building, opening up new possibilities for air travel in New York City.
1452	16285	6	3	To solve the issue of the dirigible's size, engineers had to design a massive docking port that could accommodate the length of the airship. Additionally, they had to come up with a way to prevent the back of the ship from swiveling uncontrollably. One solution was to install a rotating platform at the top of the mooring mast, allowing the dirigible to dock securely without risking the safety of those below. By addressing these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building were able to create a functional and innovative docking system for dirigibles high above the bustling streets of New York City.
1453	16286	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. One major challenge was the need for a mooring mast, which would put excessive stress on the building if dropped onto its flat surface. This issue alone incurred a cost of over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, safety concerns were significant, as dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, posing a risk of fire that could potentially destroy the entire building and endanger those inside. Moreover, the threat of strong winds causing the dirigible to detach and harm pedestrians below added another layer of danger. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to anchor a dirigible on the Empire State Building. These obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea, as the risks and challenges proved insurmountable.
1454	16287	6	3	The architects, engineers, and workers of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to attach a dirigible dock to the top of the building. They realized that simply dropping a mooring mast onto the structure was not feasible; significant repairs amounting to a substantial sum of money needed to be made to strengthen the building's framework. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the winds posed a challenge, as the zeppelins would need to be weighed down to remain stable upon landing. However, this introduced the risk of weights falling and causing harm to individuals below. Furthermore, a law prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over the city, fearing the potential catastrophic consequences if a balloon were to be punctured by a structure, such as a spike from another building. Collectively, these obstacles made it unlikely for the idea of a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building to ever come to fruition.
1455	16288	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders faced quite a few problems. They faced on constructing the building. They didn't know if they could built it all. They also faced a bad climate, and faced on how much did the dirigibles weighted and if they can hold it. On paragraph fourteen it says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights."" These are a few things that the workers had to face. Additionally, they had to consider the structural integrity of the mooring mast itself, ensuring it could withstand the weight and force of the dirigibles. The builders also had to factor in the wind conditions, as strong winds could potentially damage the dirigibles or the mast. Overall, the construction of the mooring mast presented numerous challenges that required careful planning and execution to overcome."
1456	16289	6	3	The obstacles he faced were that the problems were never truly resolved, leading to issues with the wind. This lack of resolution caused ongoing challenges and hindered progress in addressing the underlying issues. As a result, the persistent problems continued to impact the flow of wind and create difficulties that needed to be effectively addressed. In order to overcome these obstacles, it was essential to find lasting solutions and implement measures to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of the wind system. By addressing the root causes of the problems and implementing effective strategies, he could successfully navigate the challenges and optimize the wind flow for better outcomes.
1457	16290	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend $100,000 to modify the building's framework, I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with that money. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building. Overall, the idea of the mooring mast was just a very poorly planned idea.
1458	16291	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the @CAPS1 had to fix the frame of the building in order to transmit the stress of the dirigible to the bottom of the building. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the @CAPS1 had to complete the roof before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building also had to make sure that the mast's skeleton was made out of steel so that the mast looked like the rest of the empire State building and not stick out. Additionally, the @CAPS1 had to consider the wind resistance that the dirigibles would face when trying to dock at such a high altitude. This required careful planning and engineering to ensure the safety of both the dirigibles and the building itself. Despite these challenges, the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building successfully overcame them and created a unique docking system for dirigibles, showcasing the innovative spirit of the time.
1459	16292	6	3	There were many problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as nature itself. At 1,250 feet, the winds were just too strong and unpredictable to get close to and dock a dirigible. On top of nature, laws prevented the landing. Airships could not fly low over urban areas, so even attempting to approach the area would be illegal. This idea still posed a great deal of potential danger even if there were no laws against it and wind didn't exist. Many dirigibles were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In such a highly populated area as New York City, if one were to catch fire, the damage would be horrifying. I hope Al Smith was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the title of the world's tallest building because he didn't get his mast.
1460	16293	6	3	"Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense. The mast atop the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for the builders such as having to strengthen the framework of the whole building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside."" In addition, the building had to have two extra floors added, one for an ""open observation platform"" and another for a ""boarding area for dirigible passengers."" Even though the mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, the building was still hailed as the world's tallest building."
1461	16294	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, certain obstacles such as foundation support, nature, and safety challenged the building of the docking station for dirigibles. The first problem the architects faced was the docked dirigibles placing too much stress on the building. To combat this problem, drastic changes to the building would have to be made. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This change was stated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced upon constructing the mooring mast was nature. At this height, the wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Despite being tethered to the building, the dirigibles would spin and twist around the mass, an unsecure and dangerous aspect. Lastly, as the excerpt claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were too great. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been...above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The moor provided severe risk to the safety of the people of New York. This problem served as a serious obstacle for the builders of the mooring mass. The building's foundations, nature, and safety violations all posed challenges that needed to be addressed in order to successfully complete the construction of the docking station for dirigibles."
1462	16295	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling or service. However, this would require around $1 million worth of modifications to be made to the framework. In May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the builders realized the catastrophic consequences that could have occurred had a similar event taken place above the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building would constantly shift due to harsh and violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swing around. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over cities and urban areas, making it impossible for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. Overall, the builders faced numerous challenges in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic structure.
1463	16296	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, some obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the winds were too strong and most used hydrogen instead of helium which is very flammable. The way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a cord attached to the mast. The dirigibles would then be ""dangling high above pedestrians in the street."" This was ""neither practical nor safe."" This would not only endanger the pedestrians below but also the people on the dirigibles. The wind was so strong that it could throw it into a building. Most dirigibles fuel on hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" The owners of the Empire State building saw this as another huge problem because of how much worse it would be if one caught fire in densely populated New York. The risk of a fire breaking out in a hydrogen-filled dirigible while attached to the building could have catastrophic consequences, posing a significant threat to public safety and property in the city. The combination of strong winds and flammable gas made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible and too hazardous to pursue further."
1464	16297	6	3	The Empire State Building during its construction was planned to serve as a mast for dirigibles to be attached to. However, this idea was deemed too dangerous to pursue due to various safety concerns. One major issue was the presence of flammable gases in dirigibles, which could pose a significant risk if something were to go wrong. Additionally, the constant shifting of the dirigible tethered to the mast due to violent air currents presented a challenge that could not be easily overcome. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it difficult to implement the plan. Ultimately, the combination of these safety obstacles made the idea of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible mast unrealistic and unfeasible.
1465	16298	6	3	"In The mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the reason for the tall spire was revealed as a mooring mast for zeppelins to land. there were many difficulties faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempt for zeppelins to actually land there. One difficulty was the stress added by the weight of the dirigible ""over @NUM1 $ of work was done to the foundation. This was difficult because it could think adding that much steel to a beautiful building couldn't be easy. Another difficulty addition involved ""the mast... would to a conical head this would house a mooring arm"" think about how easy it is to take an ornate @NUM2 foot spire @NUM3 feet to the top, not easy. Last ""the winds at top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" this means all the framing workers went through hell to make the building."
1466	16299	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was how much stress would be put on the building's frame. L¸sted says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire State building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was people's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they were to make this happen there would always be the risk of someone catching on fire. Making the Empire State building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this happen. Another challenge would be the logistics of docking and undocking the dirigibles efficiently and safely. Ensuring smooth operations and minimizing the risk of accidents would require careful planning and implementation. Despite these obstacles, the idea of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible dock presented exciting possibilities for transportation and innovation. With proper solutions and adaptations, these challenges could be overcome to create a unique and functional aerial docking station."
1467	16300	6	3	Many obstacles faced the builders of Empire State Building. The biggest problem is The fact that it was illegal for a dirigible to fly that low in Urban areas, stated in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem was that most of the @ORGANIZATION2's dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flamable. So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3. Also fears of the sharp edges and forceful winds would cause the dirigible to get punctured and pop. Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles attempting to dock, as the altitude and strong winds made maneuvering difficult. This added complexity to the already risky operation of dirigible docking at such a height. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building were able to overcome these challenges and complete the iconic structure.
1468	16301	6	3	"During the @DATE1's Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle that the Dirigibles would face in landing in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. Another obstacle the architects and empire state builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the Dirigible to dock to the building, and also allowing people in and out of vehicle. Architects knew that they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. ""An A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" so architects had to reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen the structure of the building. The greatest obstacle that the Empire State builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents at the top of the empire state building would make it dangerous and unsafe for Dirigibles to dock with the building. To address this challenge, engineers had to come up with innovative solutions to stabilize the docking process and ensure the safety of both the passengers and the building itself. By overcoming these obstacles, the Empire State Building was able to establish itself as a pioneering structure in aviation history."
1469	16302	6	3	"In this excerpt Al Smith had many obstacles to overcome when he wanted Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The smallest obstacle was building the top so Dirigibles could moor at the building. ""The top would have cost over $500,000 for the needed modifications on the framework."" Another obstacle faced was the fact that there was an existing law in place prohibiting this. ""The other practical reason Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against low-flying airships."" The issue of safety was a tricky obstacle. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" The greatest obstacle was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" In this excerpt, the obstacles for Al Smith and his team were too great, and they could not overcome them."
1470	16303	6	3	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet, becoming the world's tallest building. However, the builders faced significant obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The construction required modifications to the steel frame to withstand the added stress of a dirigible held by a single cable, ensuring the stress was transmitted to the building's foundation. Safety concerns arose due to the flammability of hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside the United States, posing a potential risk to the densely populated city of New York in case of a fire. Moreover, the unpredictable winds on top of the building presented a challenge, as the shifting air currents could cause the dirigible's back to swivel dangerously and endanger pedestrians below. Despite the efforts to overcome these obstacles, the mast was never utilized for its intended purpose, illustrating the complexities involved in such a monumental construction project.
1471	16304	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame."" They would need to spend over @MONEY1 in order to modify the building's framework. Another issue, of course, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S., did not use helium. Instead, those limbs used hydrogen which is highly flammable and would have caused disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The excerpt also states that, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Additionally, there was already a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, it would be illegal for a blimp to attach to or even go near the Empire State Building. For the reasons stated, builders were not able to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the challenges posed by the structural stress, safety concerns, and legal restrictions made it impossible to establish a dirigible docking system on the iconic skyscraper."
1472	16305	6	3	The architects faced numerous challenges in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof and had to come up with a docking solution that wouldn't compromise the building's structural integrity. Even if they found a way to dock the dirigible, the added stress on the building's frame would necessitate costly modifications. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, posing another obstacle to their plans. Despite these setbacks, the builders were determined to make their vision a reality and worked tirelessly to overcome the hurdles they faced.
1473	16306	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building. All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top. All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building.
1474	16307	6	3	The designers of the Empire State Building faced challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock on its peak due to safety concerns. The dirigibles were risky to maneuver in strong winds, potentially leading to collisions with the building and endangering New York City with falling debris. Additionally, using lead weights to secure the airships in place was deemed impractical and unsafe above the urban area. Moreover, a law prohibiting airships from flying low over cities made docking illegal. These factors presented significant obstacles for the builders in accommodating blimps on the Empire State Building.
1475	16308	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area in New York City, which was a crowded area. Additionally, safety hazards were a concern as many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Moreover, the violent winds at the top of the building posed a challenge for the builders to consider. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and found solutions to ensure the safety and feasibility of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1476	16309	6	3	There were many obstacles for the builders of the mast attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked detail. Laws were an obstacle because of safety risks of having a dirigible over a densely populated area, such as the Hindenburg accident. Nature was a problem because of the violent winds at the top of the mast, which would make the ship unsteady. The last obstacle was that the builders of the mast overlooked all the other obstacles, and safety risks. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and eventually found solutions to ensure the safety and stability of the dirigibles docking at the mast.
1477	16310	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to safety concerns surrounding dirigibles. The main reason for this was the widespread use of hydrogen by dirigibles from outside of the United States. Had the mooring mast been used for docking hydrogen-filled dirigibles, the potential for a catastrophic accident above densely populated areas like downtown New York would have been immense. The highly flammable nature of hydrogen gas could have resulted in a disaster of monumental proportions, causing untold destruction and loss of life. Therefore, it became clear that the risks outweighed the benefits, leading to the realization that the mooring mast was not a viable option for airship docking. Ultimately, this decision prevented a potential tragedy and ensured the safety of those in the vicinity of the Empire State Building.
1478	16311	6	3	"There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders had to face was they had ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders faced was meeting the president of a airship transport company and the plan to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. That is just two of the many obstacles the builders faced while building the Empire State Building. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered and successfully integrated dirigible docking facilities into the iconic skyscraper, showcasing their ingenuity and determination in overcoming obstacles."
1479	16312	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the need to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over suburban areas, posing a challenge for dirigibles trying to moor at the Empire State Building. Moreover, violent air currents created difficulties as they could cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. These obstacles required careful consideration and innovative solutions to enable dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building.
1480	16313	6	3	I think the builders main problem they faced was making sure people would be able to safely get off the dirigibles and onto the actual building. They would also need to make sure that the blimp wouldn't burst into flames if it came close or crashed into the Empire State Building. To address these challenges, the builders would need to implement advanced safety measures, such as sturdy docking stations and fire-resistant materials. Additionally, they would have to carefully plan the approach and landing of the dirigibles to minimize the risk of accidents. By prioritizing safety and employing innovative engineering solutions, the builders could overcome these challenges and ensure a smooth and secure transportation system between the dirigibles and the Empire State Building.
1481	16314	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" there were several obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, they couldn't just put a mast atop the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame. Also, the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was 1,100 feet below the mast. So before they could build anything, they had to reinforce the entire structure of the Empire State Building. Finally, these obstacles were fixed, but those were the obstacles the builders faced."
1482	16315	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the choice of dirigibles over balloons due to their lighter fabric and the challenge of finding a suitable landing area in New York City. Additionally, the safety of passengers getting on and off the dirigibles must be carefully considered to ensure a smooth docking process. These factors must be carefully addressed to successfully implement dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1483	16316	6	3	The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire State faced was the lack of suitable landing area. The second obstacle they encountered was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This posed a significant challenge for the builders and architects to overcome in their quest to make the mooring mast a functional and safe feature of the Empire State Building.
1484	16317	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock were very difficult. One difficulty that they had was that the mooring mast nature it self. When the dirigibles would come to the building, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current, and the only way that they could moor is if the weighted down the back, and using them at the Empire State Building won't be practical or safe, with pedestrians below you. Another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law. the law was against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area. this was an obstacle because they didn't have much to do about this since it's a government thing holding them back. These are just some obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock. The challenges were significant and ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea of using the building as a mooring mast for airships.
1485	16318	6	3	In the 1920s, dirigibles were seen as the future of transportation, offering a promising mode of travel. However, a major challenge arose in New York City where there was a lack of suitable landing areas for these airships. Recognizing an opportunity, Al Smith envisioned the Empire State Building as a solution by adding a mooring mast to its pinnacle. This mast would allow dirigibles to dock, refuel, and facilitate passenger embarkation and disembarkation. While this plan seemed feasible, it faced several obstacles that needed to be addressed.  The first challenge was how to integrate a mooring mast without compromising the structural integrity of the building. Engineers realized that the weight of the dirigible and the force of the wind would need to be efficiently transmitted down to the foundation, which was located hundreds of feet below. This led to the second hurdle of modifying and reinforcing the steel framework of the Empire State Building to support the additional stress.  Furthermore, the third obstacle came in the form of cost. The extensive modifications required to the building's frame to accommodate the mooring mast were estimated to exceed sixty thousand dollars, a substantial investment at that time.  Despite the hurdles faced by Al Smith in implementing his vision for the Empire State Building, the addition of the mooring mast would ultimately revolutionize air travel and solidify the iconic building's place in history.
1486	16319	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" written by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they encountered was the lack of suitable landing areas in New York City. This was a significant challenge as dirigibles needed safe and practical locations for mooring. Al Smith mentioned that they were working on the issue, but his words seemed somewhat unreliable.  To address the problem, a mooring mast was added to the top of the building to facilitate passengers getting on and off the dirigibles. However, this solution posed a safety risk. Unlike dirigibles moored in open landing fields, which could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, using the Empire State Building as a mooring spot was deemed impractical and unsafe. The dirigibles would hang high above the pedestrians on the streets, creating a potential hazard.  The construction of the dirigibles and the mooring mast proved to be a challenging task for the builders, requiring careful consideration of safety and practicality. The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had its obstacles, but it was essential to find a secure and efficient solution to ensure the safety of both the passengers and the people below."
1487	16320	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most influential obstacle was nature. According to the passage, ""the Winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting."" This would make it hard for dirigibles to dock in the first place. If they even succeeded in docking then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around. The only way to solve that would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. Then weights would be floating high above the heads of pedestrians, which ""was neither practical or safe."" Another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time there was a law against any kind of aircraft to ""fly too low over urban areas."" As the passage clarifies ""This law would make it illegal for a ship took even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Consequently, the mooring mast idea was dropped."
1488	16321	6	3	To address the challenges of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the architect needed to make significant modifications to the building's framework. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be carefully transmitted to the building's foundation to prevent structural failure. Additionally, the design of the mooring mast had to consider the high winds on top of the building, which could cause the dirigible to swivel uncontrollably and potentially crash into nearby structures. Weighting down the dirigible with a lead weight was not feasible on top of the building, and laws restricting dirigibles from getting too close to buildings further complicated the situation. Overall, the challenges of accommodating dirigibles at the Empire State Building required innovative solutions and careful consideration of safety concerns.
1489	16322	6	3	In the excerpt Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the need for significant modifications to the building's framework to withstand the load and wind pressure of the dirigibles, ensuring that these forces could be transmitted safely to the building's foundation. Additionally, the prevalent use of hydrogen in dirigibles posed a serious safety risk in the event of a fire, especially in a densely populated urban area. Moreover, the violent air currents could cause the back of a dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, creating a potential hazard for pedestrians below. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas and from tying up or approaching buildings, further complicating the docking process. In conclusion, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles were numerous and complex, requiring careful consideration and innovative solutions to overcome.
1490	16323	6	3	The builders faced many problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building which ranged from legal, to structural, to logistical problems. Firstly there was a law in place which restricted airships from flying too low over urban areas as explained in paragraph 1. In addition to this legal problem, the builders encountered the structural problem of putting a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. According to the article, the stress of the dirigible load along with wind pressure would have to be transmitted over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Because of this added weight, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building as cited in paragraph 2. Also, the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging. In fact, half of the attempted dirigible landings at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds. Although a dirigible landing mast would have put the Empire State Building on the forefront of modern travel, it could not be done due to legal, structural, and logistical problems. Ultimately, the obstacles proved too great for the construction of a dirigible dock on the iconic skyscraper.
1491	16324	6	3	"The builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the Empire State Building, it ""would add stress to the building's frame."" The building would then have to be modified to meet these needs. Nature played a big obstacle as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe environment. Finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These three main reasons prevented dirigibles from landing on top of The Empire State Building."
1492	16325	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced several major obstacles. One major problem was the use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, in a highly populated area. Additionally, laws restricted aircraft from flying too low over urban areas, posing a challenge for construction. Furthermore, the strong winds at the building's height made it difficult for aircraft to land safely. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic Empire State Building.
1493	16326	6	3	They get a good idea to construct the building, but they faced significant challenges in the process, such as planning and design. These obstacles made the task of building the structure quite difficult.
1494	16327	6	3	Many obstacles were established for the workers in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The first challenge was ensuring the safety of the docking process, as any mishap could have catastrophic consequences due to the presence of civilians below. Additionally, the workers had to contend with the issue of wind pressure, which could compromise the stability of the mast and hinder the dirigible's docking. Furthermore, the flammable nature of hydrogen, which powered the dirigible, posed a significant risk to the environment. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered in their efforts to enable dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building.
1495	16328	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face being up in the air for so long. They also had to face trying to dock the dirigible on top of the roof while still staying safe themselves. In addition to these challenges, they had to consider the unpredictable weather conditions that could impact the docking process. The strong winds and sudden changes in weather patterns made it even more difficult to ensure the safety of both the dirigible and the individuals involved in the docking operation. Despite these obstacles, the builders were determined to find a solution that would allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Through careful planning and innovative engineering, they were eventually able to create a docking mast that could accommodate these airships. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the history of aviation and showcased the perseverance and ingenuity of the individuals involved in the construction of the iconic Empire State Building.
1496	16329	6	3	"To the Empire State building did have a flat roof but they cannot just drop the mooring mast on top of the roof because it would add stressed to the frame. To build a mooring mast the cost would be more than sixty thousand dollars. Building a mooring mast would not be easy because the wind on top of the Empire state building would constantly change direction; therefore the dirigibles would be swirling around."" Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". Then there was a law that air craft should not fly too low over urban areas. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" For dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building had many obstacles. Additionally, the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas further complicated the possibility of mooring dirigibles on the building. With these regulations and safety concerns in mind, utilizing the Empire State Building as a mooring location for airships proved to be unfeasible and risky."
1497	16330	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, obstacles builders faced building a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed One obstacle builders faced was how to go about attaching it. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another obstacle would be the accumulated cost of the renevisions due to the first problem. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work."" These obstacles prevented the mast for ever being used its intended purpose.  The challenges of attaching the mast and the subsequent costly modifications ultimately hindered the mooring mast from fulfilling its envisioned function atop the Empire State Building."
1498	16331	6	3	The construction of the mast was a good idea, but the builders failed to consider the potential dangers involved. Attaching the ship to the mast without proper weight distribution could lead to the ship swinging uncontrollably in strong winds. Additionally, the builders should have recognized the need to set a high standard for safety, as other builders may attempt similar projects in the future. Despite considering using weights to balance the ship's weight, they were unable to find a safe solution. Proceeding without addressing these risks could have resulted in a catastrophic accident that put many lives at risk. In hindsight, while the Dirigible was a promising concept, more thorough planning and consideration of safety measures were essential before proceeding with its construction.
1499	16332	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 faced a number of problems. One problem they had was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. @CAPS1 had to modify and strengthen the building to accommodate the new situation. The dirigible was so big that they could not even anchor the back of it to the roof. @CAPS1 had a hard time trying to figure out how the dirigibles would land because the wind was so strong the pilot could not even control the dirigible. @CAPS1 had to put another sixty thousand dollars into it because of the modifications. Al Smith was the one who thought of this idea, but then he realized it wouldn't work. Eventually, the @CAPS1 finished constructing it, but the dirigibles could not dock there."
1500	16333	6	3	"Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. First and foremost, a mooring mast would have to be added to the building. However, according to @ORGANIZATION2, ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" before a dirigible could be moored to the mast. Secondly, outside of the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, rather than helium, as shown in @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1. The owners realized that it would be quite dangerous to have a dirigible moored over downtown New York, after the German ""Hindenburg"" ""was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1."" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). In accordance with @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Violent winds, caused by air currents at the top of the building would cause a moored dirigible to swivel, and using lead weights to counter this would be dangerous over such a densely populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 could not even dock in December 1930 due to winds. Lastly, an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast anyway. (p @NUM4) Additionally, the structural limitations of the building and the unpredictability of wind patterns posed significant challenges that hindered the feasibility of docking dirigibles or zeppelins at the Empire State Building. Despite the ambitious plans, various practical issues ultimately prevented the successful implementation of this innovative concept."
1501	16334	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a significant obstacle when trying to construct a dock for dirigibles. They encountered problems such as not having a suitable landing area, which would only allow dirigibles to anchor for a few hours. Additionally, they realized that most dirigibles from other countries used highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium. This posed a potential danger, as an accident could have been catastrophic if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The challenges they faced in creating a safe and functional dock for dirigibles were complex and required careful consideration to ensure the safety of all involved.
1502	16335	6	3	"The @CAPS1 had many obstacles Building the Empire State Building and also allowing Dirigibles to @CAPS2 there. one of the obstacles was the expanded use in New York City. As said on page @NUM1 paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the Lack of a suitable Landing Area"". Another obstacle was use of mooring mast was Nature itself. Also said on pg @NUM2 paragraph @NUM3. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself"". The @CAPS3 Obstacle was weather for an example On page @NUM4 paragraph @NUM5 ""The @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast But could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" @CAPS4 are @NUM2 concluding examples of obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to @CAPS2 near Empire State Building. Another challenge that hindered the use of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the lack of advanced technology for navigating through turbulent weather conditions. This limited the ability of dirigibles to safely approach and dock at the mooring mast, further complicating their access to the iconic skyscraper. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building remains a symbol of architectural innovation and a testament to the perseverance required to overcome challenges in construction and transportation."
1503	16336	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which meant going nearly eleven hundred feet below ground. Additionally, they realized that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its intended purpose. This should have been apparent before the construction even began. These obstacles posed significant challenges for the builders, ultimately leading to the realization that the mooring mast would never be able to accommodate dirigibles as originally planned.
1504	16337	6	3	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced were primarily related to safety and financial concerns. In order to successfully dock the dirigible, they would need to invest an additional sum of over $1 million to make the necessary arrangements to the building. However, this posed various safety risks, including the combustible gas carried by the airship and the potential danger to people below in the city. Furthermore, it was also against the law for airships to fly at such low altitudes, adding another layer of complication to the situation. Overall, the challenges surrounding safety and financial constraints presented significant hurdles for the builders of the Empire State Building.
1505	16338	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges in trying to establish a docking station for dirigibles due to the difficulty of safely docking thousands of feet in the air. The lack of a suitable landing area, strong winds in New York, and laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas were significant obstacles. Additionally, the risk of using highly flammable hydrogen gas in dirigibles, as demonstrated by the destruction of a German airship in Lakehurst, New Jersey, raised concerns about the safety of mooring dirigibles in a densely populated city like New York. Ultimately, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized the potential dangers and decided against allowing dirigibles to dock at their skyscraper.
1506	16339	6	3	"The idea of the Empire State Building being used to dock dirigibles may seem ridiculous now, but upon its construction, this was the original purpose of the mast at the top. Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay. Ultimately, the vision of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible dock was not feasible due to legal restrictions, safety concerns, and potential hazards associated with the use of hydrogen-filled airships."
1507	16340	6	3	"First of all, foreign blimps using hydrogen are very dangerous due to the high risk that they will burst into flames. This only occurred to the builders when a German blimp Hindenburg caught on fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they ""realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident happened over New York City, many more lives would have been lost. More people would die, which would cause a bigger fiasco.  Also, the winds above the building change constantly, which would make the blimp unstable. The article explains this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would be torture on the back of the ship. The front would be secured due to its tethering, but the back would be left free to sway and swing in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at a high risk of danger, making this idea impractical.  Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, nevermind dock on it. The article tells this by saying, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect pedestrians and innocent bystanders, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate said law.  In conclusion, the three obstacles stopping the use of the Empire State Building were the hydrogen gas used in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds making the craft swivel, and the law prohibiting aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas."
1508	16341	6	3	Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work. The challenges presented by safety concerns, shifting winds, and existing laws made the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building a difficult and ultimately unfeasible task.
1509	16342	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles. They had to ensure that Dirigibles could safely dock, passengers could embark and disembark securely, and the building would not collapse during the construction of the mooring mast. These challenges highlight the complexities that the builders had to navigate while constructing the iconic Empire State Building."
1510	16343	6	3	The building wasn't designed to carry the extra weight of having a dirigible attach to the top. And the dirigibles had to have weights drop from the back to keep it in place, that wouldn't be very safe have lead weights dangle over @NUM1 feet in the air. The mast was built out of Glass which could have been dangerous if a dirigible couldn't stop and went straight into the tower. Also the electronic winching stations didn't seem like they would work too well. The structural integrity of the building could be compromised by the additional weight and stress caused by the dirigible. Moreover, the use of glass for the mast could pose a serious safety risk in the event of a collision. The electronic winching stations may not be reliable enough to effectively control the dirigible's movements. Overall, the design of the building does not seem suitable for accommodating dirigibles.
1511	16344	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock were primarily legal and environmental. Initially, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which posed a challenge for the building to accommodate docking. Furthermore, in 1930, when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to approach the mooring mast, strong winds made it difficult for the airship to get close enough to tie up safely. These forceful winds could potentially push the dirigible into the sharp spires of the building, creating a hazardous situation. Despite these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building worked to find solutions that would allow dirigibles to dock safely in the future.
1512	16345	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building, was determined to outstrip the height of the Chrysler Building. However, the architect building the Chrysler Building had a trick up his sleeve. He built a 185-foot spire and hoisted it to the top of the building. The architects of the Empire State Building could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof because the winds would be constantly shifting the mast. Additionally, using mooring masts at the street level was neither practical nor safe. Moreover, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper.
1513	16346	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast. These obstacles and dangers suggest the mooring mast is a bad idea. Which the constructers later came to realize. However, with further research and development, safer alternatives for dirigible docking may be explored in the future."
1514	16347	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges in its quest to become the tallest building in New York due to its ambitious size and the long duration of construction. Despite the obstacles, the project persisted for many years as developers aimed to create a monumental structure that would stand out in the city's skyline.
1515	16348	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The stress of a dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over $60,000 worth of modifications were needed to strengthen the building's steel frame. The engineers in New York worked on a practical solution, while government officials in Washington looked for a safe mooring method. The original text highlights the challenges and complexities involved in adapting the Empire State Building for dirigible mooring.
1516	16349	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Firstly, the building was too close to the city and not high enough, which made it difficult for the dirigibles to navigate and land safely. Secondly, the wind conditions around the building caused the blimps to spin around the mast, posing a serious risk to both the dirigibles and the building itself. Lastly, the use of hydrogen in German blimps presented a major safety concern, as any proximity to heat could potentially result in a catastrophic explosion. In contrast, American blimps were filled with helium, which was a much safer option. These obstacles highlight the complex challenges involved in accommodating dirigibles at the Empire State Building during that time.
1517	16350	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock, three major obstacles were encountered: the wind, the structure, and safety concerns. The wind posed a significant challenge due to the rough wind currents at the top of the building, making it difficult to land and stay stable on the dock. The fear of the dirigible being blown onto nearby buildings' sharp spires was a real threat that could puncture the balloon's shell.  Structuring the mast to hold the balloon was another obstacle that needed to be addressed. Dropping a mooring mast onto the building's flat roof was not a viable solution, requiring around sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework to ensure it could support the dirigible's weight.  Moreover, safety concerns played a crucial role in the failure of the mooring mast. Landing a huge metal balloon on top of the tallest skyscraper in the city, especially considering the highly flammable nature of the balloons, raised alarms among city dwellers. Despite two attempts to land, neither was successful, leading to the abandonment of the mooring mast as a functional structure.  Today, the mast remains as a decorative piece, serving as a reminder of the ambitious yet challenging endeavor to create a dirigible dock atop the Empire State Building.
1518	16351	6	3	The builders and architects faced numerous challenges in extending the Empire State Building to a height of 1,250 feet. While their plan included a mooring mast on top, this idea proved unrealistic as it had never been attempted before. Safety concerns arose due to the potential use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles outside the United States, posing a risk to passengers and the surrounding area. Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions, such as strong winds, made landing a dirigible on the building dangerous and impractical. Furthermore, the project was deemed illegal under federal law as it would bring dirigibles too close to urban areas like New York City. Ultimately, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose, showcasing the project's inherent flaws and inability to be successfully executed.
1519	16352	6	3	"Ultimately, it is evident that the entire concept of Al @ORGANIZATION1 on the Empire State building was strategically flawed. It was Al Smith's dream, but dream is not always reality. In theory, the Mooring @ORGANIZATION3 would be constructed to dock drigibles. However, it was eventually revealed that a docking station on the Empire State building would never be possible. The reason Al Smith's dream could never prove to be reality is because Smith and the builders hit many obstacles. One obstacle faced with the construction of the @ORGANIZATION3 was the location. When a landing zone is 1,250 ft above ground level, it is extremely tough to test and complete a perfect landing zone, much tougher then if it was on ground level. Also, with location is the safety of having such high wind speeds at such an altitude. It is that the higher altitude @CAPS1 get the higher the air pressure and the ""violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) @CAPS1 will have, making a very unsafe environment. Next, another aspect of the location was the fact it was in densely populated New York City, if there were any mistakes a great number of casualties would be expected. Lastly, a large obstacle Smith and the builders faced was technology, in the @DATE1's and 1930's the amount of technology and engineering was certainly unparallel to the technology prevalent in today's society. The challenges of location, safety, and technological limitations ultimately rendered Al Smith's dream of a docking station on the Empire State building unattainable."
1520	16353	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that Al Smith constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building to make it taller. By the time the new airships, called dirigibles, were hailed as transportation for the future, they were like blimps but filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter. In New York City, there was a lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles. Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the building so they could tie the line from in front of the ship. This innovation allowed dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, overcoming the obstacle of limited landing spaces in the city.
1521	16354	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over cities, meaning they couldn't dock at the Empire State building. Another obstacle was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is very flammable, so using hydrogen blimps in @LOCATION1 would create public safety issues. Finally, nature would prove to be the greatest obstacle because of wind, which could get quite violent and cause the blimps to possibly get untied from the building or fall. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Despite their efforts, the challenges posed by laws, safety concerns, and unpredictable weather conditions ultimately prevented the successful docking of airships at this iconic landmark.
1522	16355	6	3	The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the High Winds. The winds blew the dirigibles two-and-frow. It would be cotastrophic if an accident occurred. Secondly, The Law stood in the way of this idea. A law in New York was passed, that prevented dirigibles from flying over urban areas. The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey. Lastly, and probably the simpilest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt landing. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in most ways.
1523	16356	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in back with lead weights. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto nearby buildings, the plan for regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
1524	16357	6	3	The dream of the aviation pioneers to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The violent winds on top of the building, caused by air currents, made it challenging for the dirigibles to safely approach the mooring mast. The sheer size of the blimps, extending four blocks in length and filled with helium and hydrogen, posed a risk to the millions of people below on the streets. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles struggled to come close to the mooring mast due to strong winds. Additionally, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, complicating delivery attempts such as the Columbia blimp's newspaper drop. The absence of proper mooring equipment further hindered the docking process, emphasizing the need to delay the installation of landing gear for airplanes, considered the future of transportation. Ultimately, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building's mooring mast highlighted the impracticality of its original purpose.
1525	16358	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when installing a dock for dirigibles due to the building's significant height, which posed a risk in capturing the airships safely. Additionally, the structure of the tower made it hazardous if a dirigible were to crash, potentially endangering the streets of the bustling city below. Moreover, the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles presented a serious fire hazard, further emphasizing the danger of the mooring mast. These factors combined to make the installation of the dirigible dock a complex and risky endeavor for the builders of the iconic Empire State Building.
1526	16359	6	3	The Mooring Mast has two obstacles: the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and there is a law against airship flying too low over urban areas. They try to get close, but they can't because of forceful winds. In nineteen thirty, the dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring but could not get close. Therefore, a low to a security for an urban area was established.
1527	16360	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a big threat to the nearby pedestrians. Furthermore, an additional obstacle is ""nature itself"". The winds are constantly changing which is dangerous for the dirigibles. One last example of an obstacle is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would be dangerous if the dirigible lost control and harmed a pedestrian. These are some examples in the article of how there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1528	16361	6	3	Builders in The Mooring at The Empire State Building face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock. The building would need to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the blimps, costing up to sixty thousand dollars. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, posing a significant risk to the building and the city if a dirigible were to explode. Additionally, the shifting winds on the top of the building created challenges in controlling the dirigibles and keeping them stable for passenger safety. Moreover, there was a law restricting the height of airships in urban areas, making it illegal to use the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building as it was too low. These obstacles proved insurmountable, ultimately rendering the mast unused by dirigibles.
1529	16362	6	3	It was very difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face many obstacles along the way. One obstacle was that they kept trying to make the building higher. Al Smith was very competitive with the architect who was constructing the Chrysler Building which was also in New York City. Smith wanted it larger and by extending it, it became more dangerous and difficult to allow docks up there. Another obstacle was the weather at the top of the building. The winds at that height were very rigorous and with a highly populated area, they did not want an accident to occur. Allowing docks up on the Empire State Building was very dangerous.  In addition, the structural integrity of the building had to be carefully considered. The weight and force of a dirigible docking on the building could potentially cause damage or compromise its stability. Engineers had to work meticulously to ensure that the building could withstand such pressures and stresses.  Furthermore, the logistics of docking a dirigible on top of a skyscraper were complex. Coordination with air traffic control, weather monitoring, and communication systems all had to be carefully planned and executed to safely navigate the dirigible to the docking station on the Empire State Building.  Despite these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately succeeded in allowing dirigibles to dock there. It stands as a testament to human ingenuity and engineering prowess, showcasing the possibilities of what can be achieved with determination and innovation.
1530	16363	6	3	"New York is known as ""the city that never sleeps,"" with its bustling streets and always active residents. When former governor Al Smith proposed the idea of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were numerous concerns raised by both the people of New York and the construction workers involved in the project. One major issue was the potential violation of laws, such as flying airships too low over urban areas, which could result in serious legal consequences. Safety was another significant worry, as the dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that could lead to catastrophic outcomes if a fire were to occur above the city. Additionally, the construction of the mast had not been included in the original plans for the building, making it a logistical challenge to incorporate at a later stage. Ultimately, the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building faced insurmountable obstacles and was never realized due to the various concerns and limitations that arose during the planning and construction process."
1531	16364	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They had to find a way to keep the dirigibles from spinning around the top of the tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant the dirigibles would swivel around the mast unless tied down. The next problem was making the building's structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The next challenge was to create a safe environment for the pedestrians below, which was not possible because the city was already built below. The dirigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe."" Clearly, the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."
1532	16365	6	3	The builders, faced with the challenge of constructing a new office building in a bustling city center, carefully examined the blueprints and began to lay the foundation. They worked tirelessly, coordinating with architects and engineers to ensure that every detail was executed flawlessly. As the structure began to take shape, they encountered unexpected obstacles, such as adverse weather conditions and supply chain delays. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered, working overtime to stay on schedule and within budget. Finally, after months of hard work, the office building was completed, standing tall as a testament to the builders' dedication and skill. The team celebrated their success, proud of the impressive structure they had created in the heart of the city. Their commitment to excellence had paid off, and the new office building would now serve as a hub of activity and innovation for years to come.
1533	16366	6	3	Al Smith and his workers faced numerous challenges while constructing the building. One such challenge was transmitting the stress of the dirigible's load to the foundation, located approximately eleven hundred feet below ground. This required modifying and strengthening the building's frame to support the additional weight. However, the most significant obstacle they encountered was the unpredictable nature of the winds at such heights. Constantly shifting air currents made it difficult to ensure the safety of the workers during construction. Smith's decision to use a dirigible also posed a risk, as many dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of the safer alternative, helium. Despite these challenges, Smith and his team persevered, ultimately completing the building successfully.
1534	16367	6	3	The stress on the Empire State Building's frame caused by a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top with a single cable tether could potentially lead to the risk of collapse. This added pressure from the weight and movement of the dirigible could compromise the structural integrity of the building, posing a significant danger to both the dirigible and the building itself. It is clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would not be a feasible option due to the potential risks and challenges it would present. The safety and stability of the iconic building must be prioritized to prevent any potential disasters.
1535	16368	6	3	They faced many problems when trying to dock there. It should never have been made in the first place. To many things were predictable. They had no landing gear, The wind was too great a factor, and the Ships couldn't get close enough to The mast to dock. The people creating This overlooked the possibility of it not working and only looked toward building it. They had no landing gears whatsoever so it was hard to steady it and dock it. The wind was unpredictable and swung the balloon around. The biggest thing was when they slowed it down and had no wind it still couldn't get close enough to dock. Those are The problems they faced. The challenges they encountered were significant and ultimately hindered the successful docking of the balloon.
1536	16369	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The single cable tether that held the dirigible's weight had to be extended all the way to the building's foundation, posing a significant risk if it were to break. The violent air currents at the top of the building also made docking dangerous and time-consuming. To counter this, the architects tried weighing down the dirigible with lead weights, but this solution was deemed impractical and unsafe due to the risk of the weights falling onto pedestrians below. Despite these obstacles, the builders and architects of the Empire State Building persevered in their efforts to overcome these challenges and make dirigible docking a reality.
1537	16370	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders faced included the need to make significant changes to accommodate the blimp on top of the building. They couldn't simply place a mast on the flat roof; instead, they had to consider the stress the blimp would exert on the structure. This meant that the load and pressure from the blimp and the wind had to be carefully transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. This required strengthening the building's framework, which ended up costing over sixty thousand dollars. These challenges highlight the complexity and careful planning required to integrate a blimp onto an existing structure.
1538	16371	6	3	Creating a mooring mast to sit atop the Empire State Building that would function and allow dirigibles to dock there was an incredibly challenging task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the extra weight and size of a mooring mast, architects had to work to redesign the frame of the whole building. The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimp from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was against the law for aircraft to fly over urban areas, and that was the final obstacle that kept the mooring mast from being used. The challenges faced in creating a mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building were numerous and ultimately insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious idea.
1539	16372	6	3	There were many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The designers had to think their way around them. It was known that you couldn't just go up to the top and start construction. Accommodations had to be made. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Just adding it on would upset the building's structure and foundation. Safety was a concern, especially with the use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles from outside the United States. After recent fires, the dangers became apparent. Control was an issue in the city rather than an open field. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it difficult for people to load. Designers faced many problems in constructing buildings, but in this case, the mooring mast just wasn't meant to be.
1540	16373	6	3	The Empire State Building, standing at a remarkable height of 1,454 feet, was a beacon of architectural innovation and ambition. The idea of incorporating a mooring mast atop the building, not only as a symbol of its grandeur but also for practical use, was a daring concept that pushed the boundaries of design. However, the dream of the mooring mast faced significant challenges, particularly concerning the safety of using hydrogen-filled dirigibles from other countries, which posed a fire hazard due to hydrogen's flammability. Additionally, the unpredictable air currents at such heights required the use of lead weights to stabilize the dirigibles, raising concerns about the safety of the surrounding city. Eventually, the practicality and feasibility of the mooring mast project dwindled, leading to a decision to postpone the installation of the landing gear. Ultimately, the once radical and ambitious vision of the mooring mast quietly faded away, marking the end of a grand but unattainable dream.
1541	16374	6	3	Al Smith had a vision to create a site for modern travel, facing numerous obstacles in the process. The stress of a dirigible would have been too much for the Empire State Building's original framework, necessitating over $1 million worth of changes to strengthen the structure. Builders designed a rocket-shaped mast made of aluminum to accommodate the mooring arm and control machinery within the shaft, which also housed elevators and stairs for passengers. To address the lack of floors for passenger boarding, additional floors were constructed with a glassed-in observation area. Despite challenges with the mooring mast, Al Smith and architects worked diligently to modify the Empire State Building to realize Smith's vision for its destiny as a hub for modern travel.
1542	16375	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to ensure the mooring mast was safe for passengers to board and disembark. This required extensive work by engineers and architects. Additionally, they had to strengthen the building's framework with over sixty thousand dollars in added costs to support the mooring mast. Despite celebrating the framing of the entire building, they encountered a significant challenge - the unpredictable nature of the winds caused the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. After overcoming these hurdles, the unexpected happened: dirigibles were banned, and airplanes became the primary mode of transportation. This change rendered all their efforts in vain, highlighting the numerous obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their ambitious project.
1543	16376	6	3	As the builder's dream for the Empire State building grew larger, so did the modifications they needed to make. To begin, they needed to research and engineer a safe and practical way for the dirigible to dock. This was soon done with the help of navy and government research. The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the sky scraper would effect the frame. In order for the building to be structurely sound, the frame was modified to withstand the added stress. Even with research and modifications, the docking system was never put in place. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building would not allow for a blimp to actually dock safely, and so the idea was soon let go. Safety and wind were the two challenges that the builders could not over come.
1544	16377	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in bringing Al Smith's plans to life. One major challenge was the presence of airships flying too low over urban areas, which was illegal and posed a significant safety risk to New York citizens. The dirigibles were known for their flammability, and if one were to explode above a densely populated area, it could have resulted in a catastrophic loss of life. Additionally, the lightness of the dirigibles allowed their rear to swivel around the mooring mast, presenting another danger to the surrounding area. Addressing these obstacles required careful consideration and planning to ensure the safety of the public and the successful completion of the iconic building.
1545	16378	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were significant. They had to ensure that the structure was strong enough to withstand the elements and the test of time. Additionally, they had to consider the impact of dirigibles landing on the building, making sure that it would not be damaged in the process. The builders also had to carefully plan for the safe delivery of papers by dirigibles without the risk of a collision with the building. Another challenge was to create a landing area that was easily accessible for dirigibles. Lastly, they had to meticulously check that everything was in place and functioning properly to guarantee the safety and success of the building.
1546	16379	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. They realized that the additional stress this would put on the structure required reinforcement of the entire building. Moreover, the docking of a blimp was considered dangerous, as evidenced by the tragic Hindenburg disaster. This necessitated careful planning and engineering to ensure the safety of the building and any potential airships attempting to dock. By addressing these challenges, the engineers were able to successfully implement a docking system for blimps on the iconic Empire State Building.
1547	16380	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible be supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas. The builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for dirigible docking. The process of ensuring the dirigible could dock safely was complex and required meticulous planning and construction techniques to address the weight distribution and delicate structure of the mooring mast.
1548	16381	6	3	"When faced with the prospect of building the tallest building in the world, Al Smith refused to give up. In order to achieve his goal, he decided to build a Dirigible docking mast atop his new creation. But with this genius idea came obstacle after obstacle, preventing the idea from ever taking flight. One obstacle faced by Al Smith, and by far the greatest, was safety. Most non-American Dirigibles used hydrogen within their Dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The owners of the empire state building realized how bad it would have been if a fiery explosion happened ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". Another great obstacle was nature itself. ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it impossible for the Dirigible to be tethered without the back of ship swirling around the mooring mast. Additionally, the sheer height of the building posed a challenge for the airships to safely dock and undock without any issues. The structural integrity of the mast itself had to be carefully considered to withstand the force of the wind and the weight of the airship. Despite Al Smith's determination and innovative idea, the obstacles of safety and nature ultimately prevented the Dirigible docking mast from becoming a reality on the Empire State Building."
1549	16382	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law. Safety was a significant concern due to the flammability of Hydrogen used in dirigibles. The risk of a fire in a densely populated area like New York City was too high. Additionally, the unpredictable wind patterns at the top of the building made docking a dirigible challenging and dangerous. The constant shifting air currents could cause the dirigible to sway uncontrollably, posing a threat to people below. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building. Despite Al's dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, these obstacles ultimately prevented it from becoming a reality.
1550	16383	6	3	"The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building flat roof. When they tried to build it, there was not enough space, so they tried to force it, but that only made things worse. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, without stress to the building's frame."" However, adding more weight to the building made it more likely to fall. They attempted to enhance the building's appearance by adding more features, but unknowingly, it only increased the risk of collapse. It became evident that trying to improve the building with additional structures was causing more harm than good. Ultimately, the architects' efforts to make the Empire State building capable of accommodating a mooring mast were futile and detrimental."
1551	16384	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for airships to safely dock. In addition, there were laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the use of the mooring mast. These factors combined to create significant challenges for airship operations, ultimately limiting the effectiveness of the mooring mast as a viable transportation option.
1552	16385	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as detailed in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. Nature posed a significant challenge, with the back of the ship swiveling uncontrollably around the mooring mast even when tethered. Safety concerns were paramount, as the potential for accidents high above downtown New York was deemed too risky. Legal restrictions also hindered the project, as laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. The construction required for a mooring mast was extensive, costing over $100,000 in modifications and demanding meticulous planning. Ultimately, the obstacles proved insurmountable, and the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose."
1553	16386	6	3	There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another reason consists of law. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is definitely not the city for this idea just because there are a lot of people walking around and there are many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would have to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea disappeared.
1554	16387	6	3	Al Smith's idea of enlarging the Empire State Building and adding a docking area for airships posed significant challenges for the builders. One major obstacle was the potential stress on the building's frame from the weight and wind pressure of the airships. This stress would require extensive reinforcement of the building's foundation, which extended an impressive eleven hundred feet below ground level. The cost and complexity of this task were daunting.  In addition to structural concerns, the builders had to contend with the unpredictable and powerful wind currents at such heights. The building's continuous movement caused by the wind posed a significant risk, making traditional stabilization methods like lead weights too dangerous to consider. The safety of pedestrians below was a top priority, necessitating innovative solutions to ensure the building's stability.  Moreover, the builders had to comply with regulations that prohibited airships from flying too close to the ground. This legal restriction added another layer of complexity to the project, requiring meticulous planning and execution to create a safe and functional docking area for dirigibles.  Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in realizing Al Smith's vision of a larger structure with a docking area for airships. Overcoming these obstacles required innovative engineering solutions and careful consideration of safety regulations, highlighting the complexity of this ambitious construction project.
1555	16388	6	3	The main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were safety and nature itself. Safety was crucial, especially since they planned to have dirigibles land on top of the building. However, the use of hydrogen by most dirigibles posed a significant risk due to its flammability. This danger was magnified in a densely populated area like New York City. Additionally, nature presented challenges, particularly regarding the unpredictable weather conditions at the top of the building. The shifting winds made it difficult for dirigibles to land safely at the mooring mast. Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mast, the turbulent air currents would cause it to sway uncontrollably. These obstacles, rooted in safety concerns and the challenges of nature, made the task of incorporating dirigible landings at the Empire State Building a formidable challenge for its builders.
1556	16389	6	3	Another challenge faced by builders was the limited space available on the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock. The small landing area at the top of the building made it difficult for the airships to maneuver and dock safely. Additionally, the height of the building posed a risk for airships to navigate and land without the proper equipment and technology. These challenges combined made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
1557	16390	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.  The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem.   The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe.   The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.  Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck."
1558	16391	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. The challenges faced by the builders ultimately rendered the mooring mast an unattainable dream, highlighting the complexity and risks associated with such a groundbreaking project."
1559	16392	6	3	The idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building seemed like a grand idea at the time of construction, but it had many obstacles to overcome. The builders first had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's steel frame to reinforce it against the pressure a docked dirigible would create. Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building, so the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers, complete with an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty-fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious, although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low, especially considering the challenges of working at a thousand feet high. Despite the innovative approach, the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building ultimately proved to be more of a lofty dream than a feasible reality.
1560	16393	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in its attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top. Initially, the issue of structural stability arose, requiring extensive modifications and strengthening of the building at a high cost. To address the need for a docking mechanism, electrical winches were installed to assist in the docking process.  Safety concerns regarding the use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles posed a significant risk to the densely populated city below. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of wind patterns presented a challenge, as securing the dirigibles in place without endangering the surrounding area proved to be problematic.  Despite efforts to mitigate these challenges, the presence of a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas ultimately thwarted the Empire State Building's plans to accommodate dirigibles. This series of obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the project, highlighting the complexities involved in integrating airship docking capabilities in an urban setting.
1561	16394	6	3	"The obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the winds on top of the Empire State Building. This is because in paragraph 1 it states that ""the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This problem would make the dirigibles swivel around in the air. Another obstacle is that the dirigibles had is that it uses hydrogen and Helium which is highly flammable. Additionally, the height of the building and the narrow space available for docking also posed challenges for the dirigibles. The combination of these factors made it difficult for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building."
1562	16395	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced such as the high winds, and how they could dock the dirigibles when it is against the law to fly an aircraft to low near urban areas. one obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and high winds. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced is the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to ever dock at building because it was illegal for aircrafts to fly to low near urban areas and it would have been a long process to ever get the government to let them.
1563	16396	6	3	The builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to moor dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One of the major challenges was the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building, which created dangerous air currents. These shifting winds caused the back of the dirigible to swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast, posing a significant safety risk. Additionally, having the dirigibles suspended high above the streets where pedestrians walked was deemed impractical and hazardous. Furthermore, there was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of mooring dirigibles on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders encountered multiple hurdles, including safety concerns and legal restrictions, in their efforts to moor dirigibles on the iconic skyscraper.
1564	16397	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles with trying to build a docking station for dirigibles. They first needed to make $1 million worth of modifications to strengthen the building to ""accommodate this new situation."" This however, was an obstacle they were able to overcome. The next problem was that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is flammable, and after the fire of the Hindenburg, people realized how potentially dangerous this docking idea was. Another problem was the weather. High winds could cause problems when the dirigibles are trying to dock. To top off, this list of problems is the fact that there is a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Ultimately, there were just too many obstacles for the builders to overcome, and the mooring mast was never successful."
1565	16398	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were severe. The greatest and most important obstacle they faced was safety. If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire. Especially in a place as crowded as New York. This was another problem with landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building.   Another obstacle was the wind. A dirigible could not land unless it was weighted down with lead weights which also was not a bit safe for people walking freely in New York City. These problems are the reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building.
1566	16399	6	3	In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was because of safety reasons. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the winds on top of the building. The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Having to tie up the dirigible to the building would be illegal. But as years passed on the idea of using the mooring mast died out leaving there to be no more obstacles to face. Despite the challenges faced, the decision not to proceed with the mooring mast ultimately ensured the safety and legal compliance of the Empire State Building.
1567	16400	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The greatest reason was one of safety. Dirigibles often used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, making it dangerous over a populated area if a fire were to occur. Additionally, the violent air currents on top of the building posed a significant challenge, as the shifting winds would be too much for a dirigible to handle. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock at the Empire State Building. These obstacles combined made it impossible for dirigibles to safely and legally dock at the iconic skyscraper.
1568	16401	6	3	Dirigibles, also known as airships, were impressive aircraft with a top speed of eighty miles per hour and the capability to cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without requiring refueling. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, equivalent to the length of four blocks in New York City. However, their expanded use in New York was hindered by the lack of a suitable landing area. The main obstacle to the successful utilization of the mooring mast was nature itself, as windows on the top were constantly at risk of damage due to violent air currents. Despite their remarkable capabilities, the challenges posed by landing and mooring limited the widespread adoption of dirigibles in New York City.
1569	16402	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, workers faced numerous challenges in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Initially, the building was constructed with the intention of claiming the title of the world's tallest building from the Chrysler Building. To achieve this goal, Al Smith proposed the addition of a mooring mast to the building, making it even taller. However, this decision required significant modifications and strengthening of the structure, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Architects and engineers consulted experts to ensure the safety and feasibility of the mooring mast.  Despite the extensive efforts put into preparing the Empire State Building for dirigible docking, the mooring mast was never utilized as intended. The idea of having dirigibles moored high above the street was deemed impractical and unsafe, ultimately leading to the abandonment of this feature. Thus, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never realized its intended purpose, despite the considerable time and resources invested in its construction."
1570	16403	6	3	In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work.
1571	16404	6	3	The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible had been a good one in theory, offering a solution to the problem of limited landing space. However, upon completion of the building, flaws in the plan became apparent. The violent air currents surrounding the building would pose a significant risk, causing the dirigible to be pushed dangerously close to the structure. Additionally, the use of highly flammable hydrogen gas in most dirigibles raised concerns about the potential for a catastrophic explosion, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster in 1937. Even if these issues were addressed, existing laws prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas, making any attempts to land on the Empire State Building illegal. Ultimately, the concept of a dirigible docking at the top of the iconic skyscraper proved to be impractical and unsafe, leading to the abandonment of this ambitious idea.
1572	16405	6	3	"While building the Empire State building, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The original problem was figuring out how to get the dirigible onto the building. After consulting with the Navy as well as meeting with the president of newly formed ""airship transport company,"" they thought they were past the rough of it, but there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mass, they realized with the height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix these problems, and it cost over $1 million to make these modifications. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt of dirigibles to dock to stop in its tracks. Many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team. It could be very dangerous, as some gases used in dirigibles are extremely flammable. Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock at such high altitudes with ""constantly shifting"" air currents. All of these problems were amplified because it was even more unsafe for these problems to exist in such a populated area. The build team was able to overcome some obstacles, but some caused too many potential problems to be fixed. Ultimately, the challenges of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building proved to be too great, leading to the abandonment of the idea."
1573	16406	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, a lot of stress would be put on the building's frame with a thousand foot dirigible held to it, so the builders would have to make many modifications to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Additionally, safety was a paramount reason as to why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there because of the highly flammable gas, Hydrogen that is used in most dirigibles. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Furthermore, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents caused shifting winds, making the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, which wasn't safe for the pedestrians on the streets below. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose."
1574	16407	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York City it would be catastrophic! For example the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die.
1575	16408	6	3	While building the mooring Mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the construction team faced numerous challenges. One of the primary concerns was ensuring that the massive dirigibles would not cause damage to the building's framework. The weight of the dirigibles, combined with the force of the wind, posed a significant threat to the building's foundation. To address this issue, the builders had to carefully plan and design the mooring mast to withstand these forces.  In addition to structural concerns, the construction team also had to familiarize themselves with the operation of dirigibles and the process of docking them on buildings. They consulted with experts and studied the equipment extensively to ensure that they understood how the dirigibles would fly and how they could be safely docked on the mast.  Furthermore, the safety of the public was a top priority throughout the construction process. Despite their efforts, it ultimately proved impossible to guarantee the safety of the public if dirigibles were to be docked on the building. As a result, the mooring mast was never used as a docking station, highlighting the challenges and complexities involved in this ambitious project.
1576	16409	6	3	The shifting wings on top of the Empire State Building posed a significant challenge for dirigibles attempting to dock there. Due to violent air currents, the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast, making it difficult to secure them safely. While lead weights could be used to stabilize dirigibles in open landing fields, using them at the Empire State Building was deemed impractical and risky, especially considering the height at which the weights would be dangling above the bustling streets below. As a result, the builders faced a formidable obstacle in their attempts to facilitate dirigible docking at the iconic skyscraper.
1577	16410	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders had to face many obstacles while constructing the Empire State building to be able to allow drigibles to dock there. The builders had to face many obstacles such as laws and changes in the building structure that were not initially considered. After creating the plan to add a mast on the top of the Empire State building for docking dirigibles, architects realized that simply placing a mooring mast on the flat roof would not work. The stress of a thousand-foot dirigible moored by a single cable tether would strain the building's frame. Additionally, the shifting winds on top of the building posed a challenge due to violent air currents. Moreover, safety laws restricted airships from flying too low over urban areas, making the dirigibles' docking more complex. These obstacles, including safety regulations, weather conditions, and structural limitations, presented significant challenges for the builders in implementing the mooring mast on the Empire State building."
1578	16411	6	3	"The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted discusses the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The fear of accidents, especially after the Hindenburg disaster, posed a significant problem as most international dirigibles used flammable hydrogen. Additionally, the nature of the mooring mast and violent air currents made it impractical and unsafe to have a dirigible docked high above the pedestrians on the street. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to approach or tie up to the building. Despite the architects' initial excitement, these obstacles led to the eventual failure of the project, causing the idea to fade into obscurity and be forgotten."
1579	16412	6	3	The builders faced a lot of issues to allow drigibles to land place on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious or carefull on building the platform to allow drigibles to dock. The drigibles (Blimp) were very big transportation machines that were made out of Steel and Cotton Fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable. Because of all these problems the procautions the builders had to make, makeing the mast was a failuer and left for the future transportations to plains. Due to the challenges and risks involved in accommodating drigibles, the decision to forego the construction of a docking station on the Empire State Building was made, leaving it to be a feature for future transportation modes.
1580	16413	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they had to reconstruct the building to add the mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The mast was an obstacle they had to face. Also, they had to face all of the safety requirements. ""Was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After they figured out what could go wrong if they docked dirigibles, the original purpose of the mast was not able to be fulfilled. Another obstacle they had to face was testing their plan to dock dirigibles. ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up."" The dirigible failed in their attempt, and the idea of docking dirigibles disappeared in the late 1930s. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their pursuit of allowing dirigibles to dock at the iconic building."
1581	16414	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State Building faced many safety & practical obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of it. For example, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a @NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical & safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the challenges of hydrogen gas, stress on the building's frame, and unpredictable winds made docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building unfeasible."
1582	16415	6	3	Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the buildings flat roof. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building. Ultimately, the vision of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building proved to be impractical and unsafe, leading to the project's abandonment.
1583	16416	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the flammability of hydrogen, which was commonly used in dirigibles from outside the United States. The Hindenburg disaster in 1937 served as a tragic reminder of the dangers posed by hydrogen-filled airships. Additionally, the unpredictable winds at the top of the building presented a significant challenge. The shifting air currents made it difficult to securely moor a dirigible, especially without the ability to use lead weights to stabilize the craft. Furthermore, laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas due to safety concerns added another layer of complexity to the situation. The combination of these factors made it clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a practical or safe solution.
1584	16417	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the need for a strong support system to hold the dirigible in place, as simply placing a mooring mast on the flat roof was not feasible. Additionally, the use of hydrogen by most dirigibles from outside the United States posed a significant safety risk due to its flammability. The changing wind speeds in New York City could also cause instability for the dirigibles, making docking a potentially dangerous endeavor. Despite these obstacles, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked to find solutions to allow dirigibles to safely dock at the mooring mast.
1585	16418	6	3	When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem. The actual building was a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed. Safety is important, if one person dies per trip nobody is going to go on the balloon. Safety is important, no safety means no business. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. Maybe one day they will fix it.
1586	16419	6	3	In The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The shifting winds on top of the building posed a constant danger due to violent air currents, making it unsafe for dirigibles to maneuver around the structure above pedestrians. Additionally, the fact that dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium presented a major risk, as a potential fire above the densely populated area of downtown New York was a terrifying possibility. Moreover, the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building, further complicating the docking situation. Despite these challenges, the builders persevered in their efforts to find a solution, highlighting the determination and innovation required to overcome such obstacles in the pursuit of progress.
1587	16420	6	3	The violent air currents above the Empire State Building posed a significant challenge for dirigibles attempting to dock. These strong currents would constantly push the ships as they tried to dock and sway the back end while they were docked. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it essentially illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State Building. These obstacles ultimately led to the spire at the top of the building never being used for dirigible docking, despite initial plans and designs suggesting otherwise.
1588	16421	6	3	There were many obstacles that stood in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact the dirigible would be relatively in close proximity with the pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast. In addition, there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do just that if it attached to the mast. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast. The solution would be to put heavy blocks in the back that could cause it to fall on top of the pedestrians. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1589	16422	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there were significant. The use of flammable hydrogen by dirigibles from outside the United States posed a major safety concern, especially in light of the infamous Hindenburg disaster. Additionally, existing laws prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, making it difficult for them to approach the building. For example, the Los Angeles dirigible struggled to tie up due to strong winds. These challenges highlight the complexities that the owners of the Empire State Building encountered in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles.
1590	16423	6	3	The builders of the Empire State built two floors just for the passengers to drop off their luggage. They had a view in those floors, and the idea didn't work, resulting in a waste of money on those extra rooms. They then attempted to make dirigibles dock on the top of the building, but this endeavor also proved to be a costly mistake, resulting in a significant waste of time and money. Ultimately, these efforts to incorporate unique features into the Empire State Building did not pan out as expected, leading to unnecessary expenditures and unsuccessful outcomes.
1591	16424	6	3	The Empire State Building was designed to become the world's tallest building and also function as a mooring mast for dirigibles. However, there were several obstacles that hindered this plan from becoming a reality. One major issue was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons, such as hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed a threat to the safety of civilians in New York City. Additionally, the windy conditions in the area made it difficult for the dirigibles to safely moor to the building. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it impossible for the ships to moor to the Empire State Building. Despite good intentions, the builders failed to consider the practicality and safety concerns of mooring ships to the building. Ultimately, the idea of using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for dirigibles was not feasible due to these various challenges.
1592	16425	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, as mentioned, a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. This stress would need to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Wind was another obstacle that had to be overcome, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Additionally, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using lead weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. These challenges required innovative solutions to ensure the safety and stability of the dirigibles attempting to dock at the iconic building.
1593	16426	6	3	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futuristic design carried a lot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York. Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigorously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didn't end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But an accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quietly retired. Despite the initial vision and effort put into the project, the risks and challenges surrounding it ultimately led to the decision to abandon the idea of the Mooring Mast.
1594	16427	6	3	When the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles first came about, it seemed like a brilliant idea. But as time and construction went on, the surmounting obstacles that arose made the idea of a mooring dock stay just an idea. When the mooring mast was finished, the obvious safety hazards stopped it from fulfilling its purpose. The greatest hazard was the nature of the mast itself. The winds at that height were strong, violent, and constantly shifting. Even if the dirigible was tethered down, the back of the ship would be swirled around the mooring mast. Another hazard was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that they could not take that risk. A final obstacle that arose was a law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even come near the building. Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigibles made maneuvering near a tall building like the Empire State Building a logistical nightmare. Overall, the combination of safety hazards, flammable gases, and legal restrictions made the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles unfeasible.
1595	16428	6	3	The obstacles the engineers faced were similar to those of any builder. They had to consider factors such as high wind conditions, the sturdiness of the frame, and the payroll for the engineers. Al Smith, however, did not encounter these problems but had to reconsider the Mooring Mast idea. Hanging a 1,000-foot structure from a building 1,250 feet in the air was a bold move by Al Smith to create a landmark for the U.S. Yet, the non-usable nature of the Mooring Mast at the top raised questions about its practicality. Despite this, Al Smith's vision and ambition left a lasting mark on the architectural landscape.
1596	16429	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles from outside the US used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. The shifting winds on top of the building created further challenges, necessitating the use of weights to anchor the dirigibles. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, preventing the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building from being realized. Ultimately, the risks and legal restrictions made it impractical to have dirigibles moor at the iconic skyscraper.
1597	16430	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many natural and social obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The violent air currents on top of the building posed a significant threat, making it unsafe for dirigibles to land as they would swivel around the mooring mast due to the shifting winds. Furthermore, the majority of dirigibles using hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, as opposed to the safer helium, increased the risk of fire and danger to those living nearby. Additionally, the law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making the docking of ships at the Empire State Building illegal. Despite the challenges faced by the builders, the idea of allowing dirigibles to land at the Empire State Building was ultimately not feasible due to these natural and social oppositions.
1598	16431	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the building had to be modified and strengthened, costing over $1 million worth of modifications. These modifications were necessary to ensure that the dirigibles could safely dock at the building. Despite the challenges and costs involved, the builders were determined to make the necessary changes to accommodate the dirigibles. Ultimately, their efforts paid off, and the Empire State Building became one of the few buildings in the world equipped to handle airship docking.
1599	16432	6	3	The builders had many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was they had to make sure the building was high enough. They also had to make sure the building was durable enough. Those are some of the obstacles they had to overcome to allow the dirigibles to dock there. Additionally, they needed to consider factors such as weight capacity, wind resistance, and safety measures to ensure a successful docking process. By addressing these challenges, the builders were able to create a suitable docking space for the dirigibles.
1600	16433	6	3	When allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced several obstacles. The building's structure was not initially equipped to accommodate a dirigible of that size, requiring modifications costing at least sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, dirigibles at that time used highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium, posing a potential risk in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Furthermore, the mooring mast's constant exposure to varying weather conditions caused wear and tear, potentially endangering the people in the vicinity. Overcoming these obstacles was crucial in ensuring the safety and feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building.
1601	16434	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges in constructing the iconic structure. One of the major hurdles they encountered was the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building. However, this plan was thwarted by high winds and strict laws that prohibited such operations. The frame of the building had to be reinforced to withstand the forces of nature, causing delays in the construction schedule. Despite efforts to accommodate dirigibles, the air streams proved to be too strong for safe landing. Ultimately, the concept of dirigibles docking at the Empire State building was deemed impractical and unachievable due to the prevailing conditions.
1602	16435	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle was safety for pedestrians and the building itself. Most of the dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. They didn't want the dirigible to explode and fall over pedestrians and catch the whole building on fire. Safety is the main obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to let dirigibles dock there. Another concern was the potential damage that the docking process could cause to the building's structure, as dirigibles are large and heavy aircraft that could potentially pose a risk to the building's stability. Thus, ensuring the safety of both pedestrians and the building itself was a crucial factor that had to be carefully considered before allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1603	16436	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. @PERSON1 mentions that a suitable landing area was lacking for the dirigibles to moor in New York City. Adding a mooring mast to the building would have enabled dirigibles to anchor temporarily for refueling and passenger transfer. However, existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas posed a challenge. Additionally, dropping a mooring mast on the flat roof could potentially stress the building's frame with the weight of a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether. As a result, the builders decided against allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building due to concerns about the building's structural integrity and compliance with aviation regulations."
1604	16437	6	3	According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. Adding stress to the building, a large dirigible moored at the top required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. Even if tethered, winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. While dirigibles could be weighted down, the risk to pedestrians was too great. Additionally, docking hydrogen-filled dirigibles posed a significant fire hazard, as demonstrated by the 1937 disaster. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized the danger this would pose to downtown New York's densely populated area. Ultimately, the mooring mast was unable to fulfill its intended purpose due to insurmountable challenges.
1605	16438	6	3	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 details the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles. The steel frame had to undergo significant modifications, costing over sixty thousand dollars, to support the additional weight and wind pressure. Despite these obstacles, the builders successfully added a 250-foot Mooring Mast at the building's pinnacle, demonstrating their determination and engineering prowess in completing the project.
1606	16439	6	3	Obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. This made it incredibly challenging for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State Building, as the unpredictable winds posed a significant risk to both the airship and the building itself. Despite these obstacles, the builders continued to explore innovative solutions to make dirigible docking a reality at the iconic skyscraper.
1607	16440	6	3	The workers building the Empire State Building faced several obstacles, including a challenging obstacle course where a blimp sat on top of the building, putting stress on the structure. The blimp, supported by only one cable cord, added significant weight. Additionally, the workers had to contend with harsh winds at the building's height, making construction difficult. Another obstacle was the gas used inside the blimps; the workers had to be cautious not to use flammable hydrogen, like the German blimps. Overcoming these challenges required careful planning and execution to ensure the safety and success of the project.
1608	16441	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to even tie or approach the mooring mast at the Empire State Building. The restriction posed a significant challenge for the builders as they sought to incorporate a docking station for dirigibles into the design of the iconic skyscraper. Despite this setback, the Empire State Building was ultimately constructed without a functioning mooring mast for airships. This limitation highlights the complexities and constraints that the builders had to navigate in realizing their vision for the world's tallest building.
1609	16442	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was ""the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That would make it hard for the dirigibles to be tethered to the mast. Another problem they faced was the ""existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Also, the equipment used to dock the airships hadn't even been installed. Additionally, the height of the building posed a challenge for dirigibles to safely approach and dock. Despite these challenges, the builders were determined to find a solution to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, they were able to overcome these obstacles and successfully implement a docking system for airships."
1610	16443	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there in the @NUM1. The first obstacle was ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" If the builders had decided to that than the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame which could also jeopardize the lives of all the tourists who visited and everyone who worked there. There was also the fact that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Which meant the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, something like that didn't come cheap, in fact ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In all the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a failure. The most obvious being safety since most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The end result is, today the rooms that were set aside for baggage are now the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden. And the highest observation deck has never been open to the public."
1611	16444	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building due to the stress it would add to the frame. This required over $1 million worth of modifications to transmit the load and wind pressure to the foundation below. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, making it impossible to tether the dirigible safely. Furthermore, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. These obstacles ultimately prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its intended purpose.
1612	16445	6	3	In attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, many problems were faced. One problem was the stress a thousand-foot dirigible would add to the building's frame, requiring extensive reinforcement. Additionally, most dirigibles used flammable hydrogen, posing a significant safety risk over a populated area. The violent winds at the building's height also made mooring difficult, as dirigibles are typically anchored in open fields. Moreover, laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the possibility of a dirigible dock. Despite the challenges, the idea of a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building ultimately proved unfeasible due to these various conflicts.
1613	16446	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the need to strengthen the building's framework to support the mooring mast, which required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. Additionally, the violent winds at the top of the building posed a safety risk, causing the back of the dirigible to swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast. Furthermore, city laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas presented a legal barrier to the plan. Ultimately, these hurdles prevented the builders from realizing their goal of establishing a mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1614	16447	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced various obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the area commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true dangers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither practical nor safe"". The existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas created further problems. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930s the idea had ""quietly disappeared"". Despite the initial excitement and vision, the challenges and risks proved insurmountable, leading to the eventual abandonment of the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1615	16448	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hindered by many obstacles the builders had to face. Firstly, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would hurt the building's frame. Builders fix this problem by making ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework"" (page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2). After the mast's construction, two more obstacles arose. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realize the danger in letting that same accident happen in densely populated New York City. The mast's greatest obstacle was ""nature itself"". Since the winds on top of the building were away shifting due to air currents, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast. Builders thought of using lead weights to fix this problem, but dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe"". The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Though the builders and owners were able to overcome the first obstacle given from the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire state Building, future obstacles prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its purpose. Ultimately, despite the initial modifications made to the building's framework and the consideration of potential dangers, the challenges posed by nature, public safety concerns, and existing laws proved insurmountable for the mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
1616	16449	6	3	The people who built the Empire State Building had many problems building it. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing area. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. However, due to the strong winds at such heights and the impracticality of docking airships in such conditions, the mooring mast was never used for its intended purpose. This setback did not diminish the grandeur of the Empire State Building, which still stands as an iconic symbol of New York City and a testament to human ingenuity and ambition.
1617	16450	6	3	Some of the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that they were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied into the mast. Also, the dirigible's body could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and get off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Finally, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Additionally, they implemented safety measures such as reinforced docking infrastructure and trained staff to handle the mooring process efficiently. These efforts ensured that the dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building safely and effectively, showcasing the innovative and forward-thinking approach taken by the project team.
1618	16451	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were cost and safety. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over $1 million. Additionally, most countries outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen for their dirigibles, posing a significant safety risk. Furthermore, the shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, made it unsafe for dirigibles to dock. These obstacles presented major challenges that had to be carefully considered and addressed before implementing a docking system for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1619	16452	6	3	In order to build the Empire State building, some of the workers endured problems while constructing it. The engineers and architects consulted first with the experts. The obstacles the builders had to face were, one the height. It was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the building's frame. Wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting to the violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up, the back part of the ship would sway from the wind. In the end, the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the problems that came with it. Despite these challenges, the Empire State Building stands tall today as a symbol of human innovation and perseverance in the face of adversity.
1620	16453	6	3	"The future of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building became unrealistic when safety issues arose and test runs did not go as planned. Some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which could be flammable. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse than an accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" By placing a dock in the heart of New York City, it is risking the lives of passengers and citizens. When the dock was in place at the top of the Empire State Building, two dirigibles tried landing, but both times it was a failure. There were problems with landing, one being the wind. ""Dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" These dangers stopped this plan from happening, highlighting the potential risks involved in such an endeavor."
1621	16454	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the building. These obstacles included the designing of the mast and building modifications, safety concerns, and existing laws regarding aircraft. Designing the mast was challenging due to the added stress a dirigible would place on the building's frame, requiring significant modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was a major concern, especially considering the flammability of hydrogen used in most dirigibles worldwide. The risk of a fire like the Hindenburg disaster was a significant worry for the building owners. Additionally, the need to weigh down the dirigible to prevent spinning around the mast posed a hazard to pedestrians below. Lastly, existing laws prohibited airships from flying low above urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach the building, let alone tether to it. These obstacles proved to be significant challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building, requiring careful consideration and creative solutions to overcome.
1622	16455	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple safety issues when constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of the building. Al Smith's desire to surpass the height of the Chrysler Building posed a challenge, requiring modifications to the building's frame to support the additional structure. The landing of dirigibles on the building also presented risks, as the weight of the aircraft could endanger people below. Moreover, laws prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas added another layer of complexity to the project. Safety concerns for the public were paramount throughout the construction process, requiring careful planning and innovative solutions to ensure the well-being of all involved.
1623	16456	6	3	In the process of building the empire state building the architects had many obstacles. One main obstacle was making the foundation strong enough. Another was the wind factor. They had many problems in the building of the Empire state building. In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire state Building they had to strengthen the whale foundation. If a dirigible docked before the whale building would twist and sway. Another problem was the wind. the wind coming off of other building would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed. Even though they faced many obstacles they successfully completed the Empire State Building. They had to carefully plan and execute solutions to these challenges in order to ensure the building's stability and functionality. By overcoming these obstacles, they were able to create an iconic structure that stands as a symbol of architectural and engineering excellence.
1624	16457	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in adding a dirigible docking station at the top were significant. The dangers posed by the wind, the flammability of dirigibles, and the existing laws against low-flying airships all made the project extremely risky and illegal. Additionally, the builders had to invest substantial funds in modifying the building's framework to accommodate the mooring system. These challenges ultimately led to the decision to abandon the idea of using the mooring mast, highlighting the impracticality and dangers associated with such a venture.
1625	16458	6	3	In their attempts to try and build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got one and off of dirigibles. While anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to get on and off, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel which could endanger the passengers and could possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or destroyed. Another difficulty was the way the mast was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, so it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform-like design, so instead of hovering dirigibles could land, which allowed for more stability. However, due to these design flaws, the Empire State Building's attempt to accommodate dirigibles ultimately proved to be unsuccessful and impractical.
1626	16459	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. They consulted with experts, took tours of equipment used in building mooring masts, and had to modify the building for support. The architects first toured equipment at an organization and met with the president of an airship transport company to create a workable arrangement. Figuring out a safe way to moor ships to the mast was a difficult task. The foundation of the building had to be considered, as dropping the mast on the flat roof was not feasible. Over a significant amount in modifications to the frame and foundation had to be made. All of these challenges were obstacles in the architects' path to building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.
1627	16460	6	3	The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This presented a significant challenge for the architects, as they needed to ensure that the building could withstand the additional weight and force without compromising its structural integrity. Additionally, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to strengthen the building's steel frame, further complicating the project. Despite these obstacles, the builders were able to make the necessary adjustments to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, showcasing their ingenuity and determination in overcoming challenges.
1628	16461	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the Empire State Building even taller, standing at 1,250 feet. Secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as an obstacle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though, which enlightened the workers. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also, the dock or landing dock could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles being so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Lastly, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place, which was a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. Overall, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society.
1629	16462	6	3	Architects faced challenges when allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, one being the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used instead of helium. If something were to go wrong, it could pose a significant risk in a densely populated area like New York. Moreover, the shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents made it difficult for the dirigible to dock safely. The potential for the dirigible to swivel around the mast, endangering pedestrians below, further complicated the situation. These challenges ultimately led to the mooring mast not being utilized as originally intended.
1630	16463	6	3	It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the Mask which sounds like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammable and too dangerous to use in such a highly populated area. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction. In conclusion, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was not feasible due to safety concerns, natural factors, and legal restrictions.
1631	16464	6	3	"The first obstacle that the can builders faced was the fact that the idea of the Empire State building being the tallest construct in New York City had been shattered. This led them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded. When the design to make the construct of the plan was complete they begin to face more potential problems. The first being it was not logical or probable to ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" For, in doing this the amount of stress it would induce on to the frame would be monstrous, hence, it was concluded the stress would have to be transmitted through the building's foundation, which to the builders dismay was 1,100 ft. below. This resulted in $1 million worth of modifications to the foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was the wind pressure. ""Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This obstacle highlighted the need for further structural adjustments to ensure the safety and stability of the proposed plan. Despite these challenges, the can builders persevered and found innovative solutions to overcome each obstacle, ultimately leading to the successful completion of their ambitious project."
1632	16465	6	3	While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One major concern was the use of non-American dirigibles, many of which were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, unlike the safer helium balloons used in the United States. The risk of a potential explosion, especially above downtown New York, was a significant worry for the building owners. Additionally, the strong winds at the top of the building made it too dangerous to safely attach a dirigible to the mooring mast. Even if the dirigibles were tethered, the swiveling motion of the ship could not be fully controlled, and attempts to weigh down the back of the ship with lead weights were deemed impractical and unsafe. Furthermore, a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building. This legal restriction further complicated the feasibility of using the building as a docking station for dirigibles.
1633	16466	6	3	One of the obvious reasons is the height of all this taking place. The strong, always changing winds, the winds were a problem because it would make the back of the blimp sway from side to side. Another problem was trying to stop the swaying of the ship, they consulted putting lead weights, but hanging weights above pedestrians is not safe at all. Another reason was, it was against the law to fly aircrafts to low to the ground. These are just some of the reasons why this wasn't gonna to work. Additionally, the safety of pedestrians below the blimp was a major concern, as hanging weights above them posed a significant risk. Furthermore, legal restrictions prohibited flying aircrafts too close to the ground, making it impossible to execute the plan within the confines of the law. Overall, the combination of these factors made it clear that the idea was not feasible.
1634	16467	6	3	Even beginning to build the dock of the empire state building was a mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile and realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obstacle the builders faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians. Another obstacle they faced was the unsafeness of it all. The winds at that height are constantly different and could cause the dirigibles to move around. Having airships dock at the Empire State Building was potentially dangerous as well as illegal. The risks involved in attempting such a feat far outweighed any potential benefits. It was clear that pursuing this idea would only lead to disaster and put the lives of many at risk. Ultimately, the project was abandoned, avoiding a potentially catastrophic outcome.
1635	16468	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges when it came to providing a suitable area for the arrival and departure of dirigibles. They needed to expand the platform to accommodate the needs of these airships, especially when they required additional fuel. This adjustment was crucial as the dirigibles would only be stopped for a short period, typically a few hours, before continuing their journey. By addressing these logistical issues, the builders were able to overcome obstacles and ensure the smooth operation of the Empire State Building as a hub for air travel.
1636	16469	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the inability to simply install a mooring mast on top of the building, as this would place excessive stress on the structure from a thousand-foot dirigible tethered by a single cable. Additionally, modifying the building's design to accommodate a mooring dock would have been a significant undertaking. However, the most critical issue that led to the abandonment of the mooring dock idea was safety concerns. Many dirigibles from other countries used highly flammable hydrogen gas instead of helium, posing a serious risk of explosion over densely populated New York City. These safety hazards ultimately prevented the realization of a mooring dock on top of the Empire State Building.
1637	16470	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was that many dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (para. @NUM1). Docking dirigibles that use hydrogen not helium had been proven dangerous by the German Hindenburg when it was destroyed in a fire, and if anything like that occurred over New York the results would be horrible. A second obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was another safety concern. The point was brought up that ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (para. @NUM2). This would make it unsafe for the passengers on board the dirigible. A third obstacle faced is the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over areas such as New York. That law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (para. @NUM3). Those are three obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Despite these challenges, the builders had to carefully consider safety regulations, the type of gas used in dirigibles, and the unpredictable wind patterns to ensure the feasibility of dirigible docking at the iconic skyscraper."
1638	16471	6	3	"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the buildings frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" @CAPS1 pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today. Despite the challenges faced by Al Smith, the Empire State Building stands as a symbol of architectural innovation and remains a prominent feature of the New York City skyline."
1639	16472	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were those of: it was at a height of @NUM1 feet, how would the passengers be able to get on and off, takes a long time to slow down and the building is said to be 102 floors high with an observation deck on the 101st floor and a boarding/observation deck on the 102nd floor for the blimp passengers. Some more major obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had faced were some so intense they are hard to explain those major obstacles were: how to dock the blimps and how many blimps could dock there at one time.
1640	16473	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The @CAPS1 Mast,"" by @PERSON1, the architects of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems the builders encountered was that the dirigible didn't have a suitable landing area. The architects concluded that they couldn't just drop a @CAPS1 mast on top of their building because it would add stress to its frame, so they had to strengthen and modify it to make it work. Another obstacle was the fact that most dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders realized how dangerous that could be, especially above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and they knew that this idea was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and unsuccessful. Therefore, despite their efforts and creativity, the architects of the Empire State Building had to abandon the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock there due to various practical and safety concerns."
1641	16474	6	3	@CAPS1 were thought of as the future of transportation. Also known as blimps, @CAPS1 were like balloons except they were made of steel and had rubber and propellers to maintain control. These steel balloons could travel at speeds of up to eighty miles per hour. One of the main reasons why the Empire State Building couldn't accommodate docking for these airships was because most @CAPS1 from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, posed a significant risk for accidents. Therefore, the use of helium was preferred for safety reasons when it came to operating airships in and around buildings such as the Empire State Building.
1642	16475	6	3	When the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was completed, the builders began to face problems that should have been apparent from the beginning. One major issue was the law in the U.S. that prohibits aircraft from flying close to or around cities and buildings, making it impossible to tether blimps to the mast. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent weather, coupled with strong winds, would have made it challenging to keep the blimps stable. Weighting them down with lead blocks was not a viable solution due to safety concerns. Moreover, the risk of the hydrogen-filled blimps being punctured and catching fire posed a significant danger to those on the ground. Despite these obvious obstacles, the mooring mast remains unused, highlighting the impracticality of the initial plan.
1643	16476	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is about the Empire State Building and the expectations that people had for it. In @DATE1 it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. The point of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the Empire State building builders were trying to make a reality. The builders came across some obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support the dirigibles, having to add frame work, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the buildings frame."". Because of this added stress ""the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Then when a dirigible was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse it could of been it happened in a place such as downtown @CAPS1"". It is a good thing they did not do the idea. However, they did eventually install a dirigible docking mast on the 102nd floor, but it was rarely used due to safety concerns. Ultimately, the Empire State Building became a symbol of New York City's skyline without the need for dirigible docking."
1644	16477	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Mast was doomed to fail before it began. The greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety. The hydrogen, in most dirigibles, is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, it would happen over down town New York. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area."" Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles to the successful use of the Mast. Violent air currents and horse winds made it difficult to fly a dirigible near the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The Mooring Mast was doomed to fail before they began building it. The greatest reasons for its failure were air currents and safety. The dirigibles were never able to land there."
1645	16478	6	3	In addition, the extreme height of the Empire State Building posed a challenge for dirigibles trying to dock. The altitude made it difficult for the airships to maintain a steady position and could potentially be dangerous for passengers trying to embark or disembark. Furthermore, the strong gusts of wind at such heights could make it challenging for the dirigibles to safely navigate to the mooring mast on top of the building. These natural elements made the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building a risky endeavor that ultimately proved to be unfeasible. Despite the innovative thinking and ambitious plans, the obstacles faced by the builders highlighted the impracticality and dangers associated with attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the iconic skyscraper.
1646	16479	6	3	"Many obstacles took place while builders of the Empire State building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the blimps docking on the building would be too much. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". Another problem was that dirigibles were highly flameable and in such a highly populated area of New York it ""was neither practical nor safe"". Laws against airships flying too low over urban areas worked against the idea but two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. Despite the challenges faced, the builders ultimately had to abandon the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building due to safety concerns and technical limitations."
1647	16480	6	3	"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was height. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world, they had to ensure there was enough technology to do so. Additionally, they had to add an extra seventeen floors to the building, making it 102 floors instead of its original 85 floors. Another obstacle was safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph 2, the author states, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mass at such a height made it describable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mast, they overlooked certain issues that caused them to set back the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in building the tallest building, the Empire State building. They overcame challenges with innovation and perseverance, ultimately achieving their goal of creating an iconic landmark that continues to impress visitors from around the world."
1648	16481	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges in accommodating dirigibles, also known as blimps, due to the significant stress their load and wind pressure would exert on the structure. This pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To address this issue, over $1 million worth of modifications were implemented to strengthen the building and make it suitable for dirigible docking.
1649	16482	6	3	One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles was the stress that the mass of the dirigible and wind pressure would place on the building's foundation. The frame of the building would need to be strengthened to accommodate this new challenge. Safety concerns also arose, as most dirigibles at the time used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. If a dirigible were to catch fire, it could potentially cause widespread destruction in densely populated New York City. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the winds at the top of the building presented a significant obstacle. The violent air currents could cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast if it were tethered, posing a risk to both the dirigible and the building. These challenges made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
1650	16483	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon L¸sted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Ultimately, the challenges of wind pressure, safety concerns, and practical limitations led to the decision to not allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1651	16484	6	3	There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there: the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, the risk of using hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, for dirigibles posed a significant threat to the densely populated area below. Secondly, the unpredictable and strong wind currents at the top of the building could potentially cause a dirigible to veer off course and collide with other buildings. Finally, the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas made it legally impossible for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. These obstacles presented significant challenges for the builders, ultimately making it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper.
1652	16485	6	3	"The architects faced numerous obstacles when constructing the addition to the Empire State Building. Safety concerns regarding the dirigibles and the constantly changing winds posed significant challenges. These issues led to a pause in the construction plans. Weather conditions played a crucial role in the safety procedures, with the architects acknowledging that ""nature itself"" was the greatest obstacle to the mooring mast's successful use. The swaying of the ship due to the winds was a major safety concern. Additionally, the use of hydrogen in foreign ships posed a high risk, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Dirigibles outside the United States utilized hydrogen instead of helium, further complicating the safety considerations. These obstacles emphasized the complexity and meticulous planning required for the successful construction of the Empire State Building's addition."
1653	16486	6	3	The builders had to go through many obstacles to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible to dock on the @ORGANIZATION2. The first thing that was a problem with getting it to the top of the Empire State Building. They said the wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there without it popping. There was also the safety of it being up there. There was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flammable, and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to consider was if Airships were too low. The dirigible would pop. For all those reasons, they had to consider them to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible on the Empire State Building. Additionally, the weight distribution of the dirigible needed to be carefully calculated to ensure it could safely dock without causing damage to the building or endangering those on the ground. Furthermore, the weather conditions had to be closely monitored to ensure that strong winds or storms did not pose a risk to the dirigible while it was docked. Overall, careful planning and attention to detail were crucial in overcoming these obstacles and successfully allowing the dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building.
1654	16487	6	3	Having the empire state building dock and hold dirigibles brought up hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast, Al Smith knew that the mass would put too much pressure on the building frame. Another issue was the balloon itself, as most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium, making it much more dangerous to have in the crowded downtown New York area due to hydrogen's flammability. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, posing a challenge for docking and holding dirigibles. It was also illegal to fly, hold, or dock an aircraft so close to the ground. The docking and holding of the dirigibles at the Empire State Building brought many dilemmas, making it hard to carry out such an idea for such a tall building.
1655	16488	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Additionally, the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigibles was deemed unsafe due to the potential danger to pedestrians below. Safety concerns were heightened by the use of highly flammable hydrogen in many dirigibles, as evidenced by the tragic destruction of the German airship ""Hindenburg."" Furthermore, the unpredictable winds on top of the building posed a risk as they could cause the dirigible to sway and rotate around the mooring mast. These obstacles presented a formidable challenge to the architects of the Empire State Building in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles."
1656	16489	6	3	"Throughout the short story The Mooring Mast, the builders faced many obstacles to complete their vision. For example, the workers had to design a mast that would take ""the stress of the dirigible's load."" The cable at the top was stated to not be able to maintain the stress the dirigible would produce, so the engineers had to develop a new solution to distribute the weight of the dirigible evenly. This cost them time and money due to the massive height of the Empire State Building. The architects also had to do extra research to develop the mast. The workers took tours of the U.S. Naval Air Station and met with the president of the airship transport company just so they could be sure the dirigibles would land in a safe, secure way. These obstacles had to be faced in order to produce their unrealistic dream. The perseverance and dedication of the builders ultimately led to the successful completion of the mooring mast, showcasing the power of human ingenuity and determination in the face of challenges."
1657	16490	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles. One of the obstacles was ensuring that the frame of the building could support the weight and wind pressure of the airships. Additionally, a law prohibited aircraft from flying too low in urban areas, posing a legal barrier to mooring dirigibles at the building. Moreover, the strong winds at such heights presented a significant challenge, as they could cause the dirigibles to sway uncontrollably even if tethered to the mooring mast. Despite these difficulties, the builders persevered in their efforts to overcome these obstacles and make the Empire State Building a landmark of innovation and engineering prowess.
1658	16491	6	3	The Empire State Building was modified at a cost of over sixty thousand dollars to include a docking station for dirigibles at the top. However, this idea faced many obstacles, including violent air currents and wind direction changes. To prevent the dirigible from swinging and causing harm, lead bricks were attached to the tail. Despite this solution, the risks of having the bricks hanging over a densely populated New York City below were deemed unsafe. Ultimately, the plan to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building was abandoned due to the numerous potential problems that could arise.
1659	16492	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major challenge was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Additionally, a mooring mast was needed at the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and passenger access. To accommodate this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to handle the stress of a thousand-foot blimp mooring. The load and wind pressure from the blimps would have to be transmitted all the way through the building's foundation, located about eleven hundred feet below. Furthermore, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. These obstacles posed significant challenges to the ambitious goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1660	16493	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing Dirigibles to dock. One major concern was the height at which they would dock, with the building reaching a towering height of 1,250 feet. This posed a significant risk as Dirigibles from outside the U.S. were known to be extremely flammable. If a fire were to break out while one was moored to the top of the Empire State Building, the consequences could be catastrophic due to the densely populated area below. Additionally, wind presented a challenge as the back of the ship would continuously swivel around if tethered to the mast. Using lead weights to secure it was deemed unsafe and impractical. Furthermore, a law prohibited Dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for any ship to fly over downtown New York. These obstacles made it difficult for Dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complexities involved in integrating air travel with urban architecture.
1661	16494	6	3	Al Smith faced many obstacles in designing and building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. One of the obvious obstacles was the constant change in wind. The back of the blimp would not be tied down, therefore swinging around in the sky. Another obstacle would be the design of the mast. This was important because if designed wrong, the mast would put stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage. There was also a law about airships flying too low in urban areas, New York being an urban area. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some blimps were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. Al Smith and his architects should have realized and discussed these issues before constructing an unusable structure. If this was discussed, a lot of time and money would have been saved. It is crucial for architects to thoroughly consider all potential obstacles and challenges before embarking on ambitious construction projects like the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1662	16495	6	3	In this excerpt The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, but they overcame that with the decision to add a top or a hat to the building. They then had to accommodate with the new situation that new modifications had to be done so that the dirigible would not add stress to the building's frame, since the steel frame of the building could not withstand the load and wind pressure that would transmit nearly @NUM1 feet below. The biggest obstacles that led to the fate of the mast was the fact that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was very flammable, and they could not have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle though because of the constant shifting winds. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but with them dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not safe or practical. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the obstacles that builders faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. Ultimately, these challenges proved too great, leading to the decision to abandon the idea of a mooring mast on top of the iconic skyscraper.
1663	16496	6	3	"Marcia Amidon L¸sted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would remain motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire State Building are tempted to dock dirigibles 1,250 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. The winds in the airspace 1,250 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to moor a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build a 1,250-foot skyscraper, the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards. Ultimately, the combination of challenging natural conditions and legal restrictions made the concept of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
1664	16497	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, Al Smith aimed to construct the tallest building in New York, reaching 1,046 feet in height. However, his plans were overshadowed by the Empire State Building, which surpassed his building by reaching 1,250 feet. A competition arose between the two structures to claim the title of the tallest building in New York. Both buildings featured mooring masts at their summits, intended to add even more height. Yet, the builders failed to consider the potential danger posed by passing dirigibles, which are highly flammable. The catastrophic incident involving the German dirigible Hindenburg in 1937 serves as a grim reminder of the risks associated with these airships. If a dirigible were to inadvertently collide with a mooring mast, the consequences could be disastrous, potentially leading to significant chaos in New York City. The threat of such an event highlights the importance of carefully considering all potential risks and implications when designing and constructing structures of great height in urban environments."
1665	16498	6	3	The greatest reason for the use of the mooring mast was safety, as most dirigibles from outside of the United States utilized highly flammable hydrogen instead of the safer helium. However, the main obstacle faced when utilizing the mooring mast was the unpredictable nature of air currents, causing the structure atop the building to constantly shift. This posed a significant challenge for the successful docking and undocking of dirigibles. Despite these challenges, the use of the mooring mast was crucial for the safe operation of dirigibles, highlighting the importance of considering both safety and environmental factors in transportation technology.
1666	16499	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to just drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the building's frame. Though this was an obstacle, the architects spent over $1 million on modifications to the frame to remedy the problem. Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became concerned that the same accident could occur over downtown New York City. In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be allowed to dangle over busy city streets. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban a city. This made it legal for all airships to tie up or dock in this area. Those were the obstacles facing the architects.
1667	16500	6	3	When building the dock for dirigibles, Al Smith encountered more obstacles than expected. One anticipated challenge was the risk of the building being pulled over by the dirigibles. However, an unforeseen issue arose after the mast was constructed – the violent shifts in wind caused the dirigibles to wrap around the mast, making it necessary to attach weights to prevent this dangerous scenario. Additionally, the existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas posed a significant obstacle. Moreover, the prevalent use of hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, in dirigibles outside the United States added another layer of complexity to the project. These unforeseen challenges highlighted the lack of thorough planning in the concept of the docking mast for dirigibles.
1668	16501	6	3	During the time of the Empire State building's construction, architects faced many obstacles in building a dirigible dock on top of the building. The high altitude of the building led to constantly shifting winds, making it unsafe for dirigibles to dock. Additionally, laws against airships flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for dirigibles to attempt a landing on the docks. The strong winds and sharp spires of surrounding buildings posed a risk of puncturing the dirigible's shell. Ultimately, these challenges led to dirigibles being replaced by airplanes.
1669	16502	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders saw an opportunity for the Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. In conclusion, these are the obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1670	16503	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, was determined to outstrip the Chrysler Building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this, however, was actually constructing the mast, which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goals for Al Smith much farther away. Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterward that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away, and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left incomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5. However, the ambitious dream of having dirigibles dock at the building was never realized, and the mooring mast remained a symbol of an unrealized vision in the history of the Empire State Building."
1671	16504	6	3	The mooring mast presented numerous challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building, particularly in terms of safety. The decision to use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of the safer helium posed a significant risk. Additionally, the design of the mooring mast meant that the back of the dirigible would swivel around the structure, potentially endangering pedestrians below. Ultimately, the obstacles faced by the builders made the use of the mooring mast impractical and unsafe.
1672	16505	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included issues in safety, nature problems, and a dilemma with a law. Safety was a major concern as many dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An example of such a dirigible was the German Hindenburg, which went up in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City."" Additionally, nature posed a significant obstacle as the winds on top of the building constantly shifted, causing potential hazards for the docking of dirigibles. According to L¸sted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" Furthermore, legal issues added to the challenges faced by the builders, with a law in place at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, ""This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the Empire State Building encountered complex challenges related to safety, nature, and legal restrictions, making the task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the iconic skyscraper a formidable endeavor."
1673	16506	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 faced many problems with the attempt to allow blimps to dock there. One problem was that the already constructed frame was not strong enough for a new mooring mast for blimps. A second problem is shown in the quote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents..."" (L¸sted para. @NUM1). The weather at the height of the Empire State building would throw and move blimps in violent ways when trying to dock. The push of the winds even caused the threat of blimp being blown into a spire on a surrounding building, the threat is shown in the quote ""which would puncture the dirigibles shell"" (L¸sted para @NUM2). That is what could happen if a blimp tried to tether to the building. The builders also faced the laws about flying that low over an urban area. All in all the builders of the Empire state building did face a many problems while trying to allow blimps access to the building. Additionally, the sheer height of the building posed a challenge for blimps to safely approach and dock, as the altitude could affect the stability of the airships. Furthermore, the bustling urban environment around the Empire State Building added another layer of complexity, as regulations and safety concerns regarding air traffic in a densely populated area had to be addressed. Despite these obstacles, the builders persisted in their efforts to create a docking station for blimps atop the iconic skyscraper."
1674	16507	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Initially, they had to address the challenge of placing the mooring mast on the building since they couldn't simply install it on the flat roof. This meant they had to construct an additional structure to support the mooring mast. Furthermore, preparing the building to accommodate dirigibles posed another hurdle as the massive airships would exert significant stress on the building's frame. To counter this, the architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to withstand the weight of a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single tether. These obstacles required innovative solutions and structural adjustments to make the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building a possibility.
1675	16508	6	3	"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought into the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been a blimp accident before, and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the blimp would be too low. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" ""-the back of the ship would swivel around and around-"" ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The architects should've thought their plan through better."
1676	16509	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First, there was a great safety concern due to the use of helium in some dirigibles, which is highly flammable and could lead to explosions. Second, the ever-changing wind patterns posed a challenge for safely maneuvering and docking the airships. Lastly, existing regulations prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. These factors combined made it extremely difficult for builders to successfully implement their plans for docking dirigibles on the iconic skyscraper.
1677	16510	6	3	In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the architects faced challenges in installing a mooring mast on top of the structure. Placing a mooring mast directly on the flat roof was not feasible, as it would have caused undue stress on the building. The additional weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it would create necessitated extensive modifications to the building, costing over sixty thousand dollars. As a solution, a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower was constructed to serve as a mooring point for dirigibles. This tower not only addressed the structural concerns but also added a modern and sleek aesthetic to the iconic building.
1678	16511	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building included the challenge of installing a mooring mast on the flat roof. This required transmitting the stress of the dirigible's load and heavy wind pressure to the building's foundation, which was approximately 1,000 feet below. To address this issue, the steel frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to support the additional weight and pressure. This modification was essential to ensure the structural integrity of the building while accommodating the docking of dirigibles.
1679	16512	6	3	Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and luggage area. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly 200 feet below. Additionally, the builders would need to consider the weight of the airship when it is docked and the potential impact on the building's structure. It would require careful engineering and construction to ensure that the building could support the additional load without compromising its stability. Furthermore, the builders would need to address safety concerns, such as ensuring that the mooring mast could withstand strong winds and other environmental factors. Overall, incorporating a mooring mast into the building's design presented several challenges that needed to be carefully navigated in order to successfully complete the project.
1680	16513	6	3	In their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced several obstacles. One major challenge was the need to modify the building's framework to install the mooring mast. The addition of a thousand-foot dirigible, tethered by a single cable, would place significant stress on the building's frame, requiring the transmission of this load and wind pressure all the way down to the foundation, located eleven hundred feet below. This structural modification was essential but posed a considerable difficulty for the builders.  Furthermore, the use of the mooring mast was hindered by safety concerns. The highly flammable nature of hydrogen, which was commonly used in dirigibles at the time, presented a significant risk. The possibility of a fire breaking out due to a dirigible docking at the top of the building made the idea impractical and unsafe. Additionally, the unpredictable and violent air currents in the area posed a constant challenge. The shifting winds made it difficult to safely maneuver a dirigible for docking, further complicating the use of the mooring mast.  Ultimately, despite the builders' efforts to overcome these obstacles, the mooring mast at the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose. The combination of structural modifications, safety concerns related to flammable hydrogen, and the unpredictable nature of the wind made the idea unfeasible. The challenges faced by the builders highlight the complexity of attempting to integrate dirigible docking into the design of a skyscraper.
1681	16514	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mask. One obstacle involved dropping ""A mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). If they had done this, the mask would have added a great amount of stress to the building's foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened but this was too costly. Another obstacle the use of hydrogen rather than helium in foreign dirigibles. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if a dirigible had accidently caught on fire, a great amount of damage could be caused. However, the greatest obstacle involved the harsh wind current on top of the Empire State Building. Even if the dirigible was ""Tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"" (paragraph @NUM2). The use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible down while ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). In conclusion, while building the mast on the Empire State Building, the architects and builders faced many obstacles. Ultimately, the challenges of stress on the building's foundation, the flammability of hydrogen gas, and the difficulty of securing the dirigible in harsh wind conditions made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building's mast."
1682	16515	6	3	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in designing a mooring mast for dirigibles. The height of the building and the changing wind currents at such altitudes posed significant obstacles. The architects had to consider the structural implications of adding a large mooring mast to the building's top, as it would add stress to the frame. This necessitated modifications and strengthening of the steel frame, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Despite efforts to fulfill the vision of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, these obstacles ultimately prevented its realization.
1683	16516	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced with the mooring mast was the winds and the gases used in non-dirigibles. The wind was a problem because that high up the dirigibles' back would swivel around the mooring mast. The gases used were a problem because out-of-country zeppelins used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This would be dangerous if the zeppelin went up in flames over the densely populated New York. In conclusion, these challenges presented significant hurdles for the builders of the mooring mast, requiring careful consideration and innovative solutions to ensure the safety and success of dirigible operations.
1684	16517	6	3	Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They had a top speed of 80 miles plus cruise at 60 miles per hour. Some were as long as 800 feet. With such impressive capabilities, dirigibles were seen as a revolutionary mode of transportation that could potentially transform the way people traveled. The speed and size of these airships made them a promising option for long-distance travel, offering comfort and efficiency to passengers. As technology continued to advance, the potential for dirigibles to become a common sight in the skies seemed increasingly likely.
1685	16518	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible (blimps) to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In paragraph 6 the author states ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and let passengers off and on."" That's one obstacle of his company. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton, construction proceeded as planned."" The buildings structure didn't really help the dirigibles much. The efforts to include a mooring mast as a landing spot for dirigibles at the Empire State Building faced challenges due to the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Despite modifications to the building's structure, the mast did not fully serve its intended purpose for dirigibles."
1686	16519	6	3	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in the attempts of allowing dirigibles, the transportation of the future in the @DATE1's, also known as blimps to dock at the building. The biggest problem was figuring out how to make the mast work.  The main obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of strong, violent air currents, the back of the dirigible would turn around and around the mast even when it'll be tied to the mast. It is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights. Because these would be dangling high above people below it would be dangerous, just in case it falls. Also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.  Another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the building's foundation. This was solved by modifying the steel frame of the Building to be stronger to keep the building from collapsing.  The attempts at allowing dirigibles to more at the building had many obstacles but in the end it was all for nothing because there is a law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas. Despite the challenges faced, the builders of the Empire State Building showed incredible ingenuity and determination in attempting to implement such an innovative concept, even though it ultimately proved unfeasible due to legal restrictions.
1687	16520	6	3	The Empire State Building had to find a solution for the challenge of supporting a helium balloon that was lighter than air. The building's tip was too long, making it difficult for architects to come up with a suitable mast for the balloon. Despite their efforts, some aspects of the problem could not be resolved through architectural means. In order to successfully address this issue, innovative thinking and alternative solutions were required to overcome the unique challenges presented by the design of the building. By carefully considering all options and thinking outside the box, the architects were able to find a creative solution that ultimately allowed the balloon to be safely and securely displayed atop the iconic Empire State Building.
1688	16521	6	3	The @CAPS1 faced arguments, confusion, and difficulties in building it. There were various challenges that had to be overcome during the process. From disagreements among team members to technical hurdles, the journey of creating the @CAPS1 was far from smooth.  One of the main issues that arose was conflicting opinions on the design and functionality of the @CAPS1. Team members had different ideas about how it should look and operate, leading to heated debates and delays in the development process. Additionally, there were technical challenges that needed to be addressed, such as coding errors and compatibility issues with other systems.  Despite these obstacles, the team persevered and worked together to find solutions. Through open communication and collaboration, they were able to resolve their differences and make progress on the @CAPS1. With dedication and hard work, the project was eventually completed, demonstrating the team's ability to overcome adversity and achieve their goals.  In conclusion, the journey of building the @CAPS1 was filled with challenges and obstacles. However, through teamwork and determination, the team was able to overcome these difficulties and successfully create the @CAPS1. It serves as a testament to the power of collaboration and perseverance in achieving success.
1689	16522	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the stress on the building from the dirigible. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was 55 feet below. So, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The third obstacle was the winds on top of the building, which were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around uncontrollably. Lastly, the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas posed another obstacle. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These obstacles made it challenging for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complexities involved in such a venture.
1690	16523	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow blimps to dock there. One major obstacle was the fact that foreign blimps used hydrogen, not helium, which posed a significant risk of explosion if they were to blow up over New York City. Additionally, the building's high elevation resulted in strong wind currents that made it difficult for blimps, such as the Navy's Los Angeles, to approach the mooring mast for docking. There was also a legitimate fear of blimps colliding with other buildings' spires, potentially causing a catastrophic crash. These obstacles created a complex and dangerous situation for the builders to navigate as they sought to establish a safe and efficient docking system for blimps at the Empire State Building.
1691	16524	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The designers had such big plans for the building that reality was far off. One challenge they encountered was the safety of everyone. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The risk of the dirigible being caught on fire was very high. If it did catch on fire, not only would it harm the blimp, but also the buildings and people of New York. Another obstacle that was in the way was mother nature herself. No one could predict the weather, and the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Blimps would not be able to fly close enough without the wind pushing it. The winds could make the aircraft fly into buildings, which could damage the design of the dirigible. All in all, the challenges the designers had to build such a great building were only a practical dream that reality soon crushed. Despite their ambitious plans, the safety risks and unpredictable weather conditions proved to be insurmountable obstacles for the Empire State Building to serve as a docking station for dirigibles."
1692	16525	6	3	In addition, the builders also had to consider the size and weight of the dirigibles. These airships were massive in size and weight, requiring a carefully planned docking system to ensure they could safely land on top of the building. The builders had to take into account the dimensions and structural integrity of the dirigibles to create a secure docking mechanism that could withstand the pressure and force exerted by the airship.  Furthermore, the builders had to address the issue of visibility and communication. Docking a dirigible on top of a skyscraper required clear communication between the airship and the building to ensure a safe landing. The builders had to install a system for signaling and guiding the dirigibles to the docking station, as well as establishing communication channels to coordinate the landing process effectively.  Overall, the builders faced various challenges in docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building, including high winds, structural modifications, size and weight considerations, and communication requirements. Despite these obstacles, the builders successfully overcame these challenges and created a groundbreaking docking system that allowed dirigibles to land on top of the iconic skyscraper.
1693	16526	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders faced many obstacles. They were trying to get Dirigibles to land on the empire state building. They faced many problems while trying to accomplish this feat. If they were going to have Dirigibles land atop the building they would have to add floors to the building. Another one is ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" Which means they would have to waste even more money. Then something they found out later is they couldn't even do this, in the first place due to legal matters. If they did that then they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system. Once they realized that I think that they realize the project was a failure and told the world ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone too a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""
1694	16527	6	3	Engineering a docking station was supposed to be a great accomplishment for the city of New York. Unfortunately, builders faced many obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan flourish. Many engineers did not think of the hazards and for reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed. The greatest issue was safety. Dirigibles used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to occur again, it would be an immense danger to the densely populated city. Another obstacle were the winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly shifting and the backs of dirigibles would swing around and around. There was also a law against low flying aircraft over urban areas, so it was illegal for a ship to ever even approach the area. The idea for a docking station was great, however, many obstacles were not brought up in the early stages of planning, so the Empire State Building never came to be a dock.  Despite the initial excitement and vision for the docking station, the safety concerns, wind conditions, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the realization of this ambitious project. The Empire State Building stands as a testament to the ingenuity and architectural marvel of its time, but the dream of it serving as a docking station for dirigibles was not meant to be. The challenges faced by engineers serve as a valuable lesson in the importance of thorough planning and consideration of all potential obstacles in any large-scale construction project.
1695	16528	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included the challenging wind and climate conditions, which posed a constant risk during construction. Additionally, the immense height of the building presented a significant challenge for the builders. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully completed the iconic Empire State Building, which stands as a testament to their skill and determination.
1696	16529	6	3	Based on excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were significant. Firstly, the highly flammable nature of dirigibles, fueled by hydrogen gas, posed a major safety concern in a densely populated area like New York. Additionally, the financial burden of strengthening the building to support the weight of the dirigibles was a daunting obstacle. The stress exerted on the structure by a one thousand foot dirigible moored by a single cable tether would require substantial resources. Furthermore, safety concerns were paramount, as violent winds could render dirigibles unstable when docked to the building. Existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas further complicated the feasibility of this docking concept. In conclusion, the challenges posed by dirigibles' flammability, financial constraints, and safety regulations made it unlikely that dirigibles would ever be able to dock at the Empire State Building.
1697	16530	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with dirigibles. The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accommodate the 200 ft dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications. Another problem was safety. A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accidents like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavily populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure were very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" Additionally, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. These obstacles presented significant challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building."
1698	16531	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had to suffer through many hardships in building the Mooring mast and trying to dock Dirigibles on it. Some of the obstacles that the builders had to overcome were the weather and the shifting winds at the top of the building. The violent air currents made it difficult for the Dirigibles to stay in place, even when tied to the mast. Additionally, there were concerns about the safety of pedestrians and the pilot and passengers on the blimp, as the lead weights used to hold the Dirigible down could potentially dangle over the edge of the building. These challenges made the task of docking Dirigibles on the Mooring mast a daunting and risky endeavor for the builders of the Empire State Building.
1699	16532	6	3	"In the excerpt of the ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to accommodate dirigibles were significant. The immense stress that the dirigibles' load and wind pressure would place on the building's foundation, located eleven hundred feet below, was a major concern that needed to be addressed. Additionally, the use of lead weights to land the dirigibles high above pedestrians on the street was deemed impractical and unsafe due to the risk of swaying caused by violent winds at that elevation, as well as the potential hazard of landing on sharp spires of other buildings. Moreover, regulations prohibiting dirigibles from flying low in urban areas further complicated the feasibility of using the Empire State Building for docking purposes. Ultimately, these factors combined to prevent the building from being utilized as a docking station for dirigibles."
1700	16533	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the world thought that dirigibles were the future of air travel. In an attempt to keep up with the modern world, Al Smith, the lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided to top the building with a dirigible docking station. However, they faced numerous obstacles that prevented them from completing the mooring mast.  One major issue was the cost of modifications needed for the mooring mast, which amounted to sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, the flammability of the hydrogen gas used to inflate the airship posed a significant risk. The architects also had to consider the strong winds that the dirigible would face, potentially endangering pedestrians on the sidewalk below if the ship broke free from its tether.  Moreover, a law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of the mooring mast. Despite the initial enthusiasm for the idea, these obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the plan. The Empire State Building, although not equipped with a dirigible docking station, remains an iconic symbol of New York City and a testament to the architectural achievements of its time.
1701	16534	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges during its construction. The sheer height of the building posed a significant risk to their safety, as working at such great heights is inherently dangerous. Additionally, the extreme temperatures experienced at such heights would have made the work even more difficult. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and completed the construction of this iconic landmark. It is truly remarkable to think about the dedication and hard work that went into creating a structure that has become synonymous with the city of New York.
1702	16535	6	3	There were several challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't simply be placed on top of the building as it would add stress to the building's frame, which would then be transmitted to the foundation. Additionally, the architects had to modify the entire building to accommodate the mooring mast, requiring changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. Despite their efforts, the violent air currents made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Even if they were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would continuously swivel around the mast, rendering the modifications useless. Ultimately, the architects' hard work in remodeling the building for dirigible docking proved to be in vain due to the uncontrollable air currents.
1703	16536	6	3	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their biggest concern was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM1). The excerpt mentions the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, which was destroyed in a fire. ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM3). The unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles. Finally, there were laws put in place restricting airships flying too low over populated areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM4). Additionally, the sheer height of the Empire State Building presented a challenge for dirigibles trying to dock, as the altitude made it difficult for them to maintain stability. Overall, these obstacles made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a feasible or safe option, leading to the abandonment of the project."
1704	16537	6	3	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accompany this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one-thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the building's frame, causing the building to weaken much quicker than without it. Additionally, to alter the dirigible's large effect on the building, it would be necessary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over 1,250 feet. This distance was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to better support the building's structure."
1705	16538	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Another safety issue was most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe. The safety concerns, logistical challenges, and legal restrictions ultimately led to the abandonment of the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1706	16539	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as 804 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area in New York. With this, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his building. He would add a mooring mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea, there would have to be a lot of planning involved to ensure the success of this endeavor.
1707	16540	6	3	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast wasn't so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared.  Despite the initial optimism surrounding the concept of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building, various challenges ultimately led to its abandonment. The presence of flammable hydrogen gas in many dirigibles, the difficulty of docking due to shifting winds, and legal restrictions on low-altitude airship entry all contributed to the demise of the idea. In the end, the obstacles proved insurmountable, and the vision of using the iconic skyscraper as a docking point for dirigibles faded away.
1708	16541	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Therefore the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome. Further modifications were necessary to ensure the safety of the dirigibles and the building, adding complexity to the project. Despite these challenges, the builders were determined to find solutions that would allow for successful docking of dirigibles at the top of the iconic Empire State Building."
1709	16542	6	3	A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building. If a thousand-foot dirigible moored to the top of the building, held by a cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below. The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building. The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below. These weights were used for open landing fields. Moreover, the structural integrity of the Empire State Building would be compromised due to the additional weight and movement of the dirigible, posing a significant risk to both the building and the pedestrians below. Therefore, while the idea of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building may seem feasible in theory, practical considerations and safety concerns make it an unviable option in reality.
1710	16543	6	3	When the Empire State building was built they came across some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they weren't made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up, the dirigibles had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flammable, making it a risky choice for airships to dock at the Empire State building.
1711	16544	6	3	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment. Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast. The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished. Ultimately, the challenges of safety, wind speed, and existing laws made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, leading to the abandonment of the idea.
1712	16545	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. Firstly, the area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify, was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obstacles that couldn't be safely tackled.  Despite the advancements in aviation technology, the challenges posed by nature and regulations hindered the docking of dirigibles in New York City. The strong winds around the Empire State Building made it unsafe for airships to dock, while the strict laws prohibited any aircraft from approaching the city's buildings. These obstacles highlight the difficulties faced by early aviators and the limitations of air travel during that time."
1713	16546	6	3	In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of a dirigible's load. Builders set out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds that made docking a dirigible nearly impossible due to the swiveling motion caused by the winds. Another obstacle was the safety issues posed by the highly flammable hydrogen gas used inside dirigibles to facilitate floating. A dirigible fire in New Jersey highlighted the dangers of using hydrogen gas and the catastrophic consequences if a similar incident were to occur above New York City. Finally, builders also faced challenges with air traffic laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Ultimately, these obstacles collectively prevented builders from allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1714	16547	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the fire risk the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built. The risks associated with hydrogen-filled dirigibles, the ban on low flying aircraft, and the challenging winds at the top of the Empire State Building made it clear that constructing a mooring mast would be too dangerous and impractical."
1715	16548	6	3	"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I learned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger. Another obstacle was the climate. The Empire State Building's top, where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nearly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the Mooring Mast. Additionally, the height of the building posed a challenge, as strong winds and unpredictable weather conditions could make it dangerous for a dirigible to attempt a landing. The logistics of safely securing the dirigible to the building were also complex, requiring innovative solutions to ensure a stable mooring. Despite these challenges, the architects persevered in their efforts to create a docking station for dirigibles, showcasing their determination and ingenuity in the face of adversity."
1716	16549	6	3	Some of the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were things such as how to dock a dirigible to a building, fueling and service, and how to get passengers on and off as safely as possible. They also needed to consider what a thousand-foot dirigible landing on top of the building might do to its structure. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, including people from the U.S. Naval Air Station, who took a tour of the equipment and the mooring mast. Passengers of the dirigible could embark and disembark by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's foundation. Despite these efforts, some dirigibles were still unable to dock at the Empire State Building.
1717	16550	6	3	In addition to the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City, another obstacle faced by the builders of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents. These unpredictable wind patterns made it challenging for dirigibles to safely dock at the mast. Furthermore, the dirigibles would be weighed down by lead weights in the back, affecting their ability to land and take off smoothly. Moreover, the use of hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable, in dirigibles posed a significant risk to both the passengers and the Empire State Building. The potential danger of a hydrogen-filled dirigible docking at the mooring mast added another layer of complexity to the project, making it even more difficult to overcome these obstacles and successfully implement the docking system.
1718	16551	6	3	The dream for the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock on top of it faced numerous obstacles. The builders had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to support the load and wind pressure of the dirigibles. They constructed a glass and chrome nickel steel tower and added floors to make it 102 stories tall. However, safety concerns ultimately prevented the building from being used for docking. Dirigibles were highly flammable, and a previous incident in New Jersey raised fears of a similar disaster in densely populated New York City. Additionally, the inability to tie down the dirigibles in the strong winds and laws restricting low-altitude flights over urban areas further hindered the realization of this ambitious dream. Despite the efforts and financial investment, the Empire State Building never achieved its intended purpose of serving as a dirigible docking station.
1719	16552	6	3	faced numerous challenges during its construction, including a rivalry with the @ORGANIZATION2 building to claim the title of the world's tallest building. However, despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building ultimately emerged victorious and became an iconic symbol of New York City. While the initial plan to use the building as a mast for dirigibles was abandoned, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to human ingenuity and determination in the face of adversity.
1720	16553	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles faced was making sure that the people below would not get hurt. If something happened to fall, someone could get hurt. Another obstacle faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These challenges required innovative solutions to ensure the safety of both the dirigibles and the people on the ground. Despite these hurdles, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered and eventually found a way to allow dirigibles to dock at this iconic skyscraper.
1721	16554	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to create a docking station for dirigibles. One major challenge was the strong winds at the height of 1,250 feet, which made it difficult for pilots to steer the airships close enough to tie them up safely. This was exemplified by the dirigible ""Los Angeles"" in December 1930, when the captain decided not to risk approaching the building due to the fear of the wind blowing the ship onto sharp edges or other structures, potentially causing a disaster. Additionally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the docking process. Furthermore, using a dirigible that was not large enough would put undue stress on the building's frame, posing a threat to the overall structural integrity. These obstacles had to be carefully navigated by the builders to ensure the safety of both the dirigibles and the Empire State Building itself."
1722	16555	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempts to accommodate dirigibles. One major issue was the impracticality and safety concerns of having dirigibles suspended high above the streets. Moreover, there was a standing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, the structural integrity of the building would be compromised by the added stress of a thousand-foot dirigible tethered to it. The unpredictable winds at the building's summit posed a significant challenge, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Furthermore, the prevalent use of flammable hydrogen in most dirigibles outside the United States raised serious safety concerns. The Hindenburg disaster in 1937 served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers, prompting a reevaluation of the feasibility of dirigible docking on the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the combination of these obstacles made it clear that the risks outweighed the benefits of allowing dirigibles to dock at this iconic skyscraper.
1723	16556	6	3	It shows that in the future, the @CAPS1 Building in New York was never able to fulfill its intended purpose. Instead, the @CAPS2 Building has taken its place as a prominent structure in the city. The @CAPS2 Building now stands as a symbol of modern architecture and innovation, showcasing the advancements made in urban design. Despite the initial plans for the @CAPS1 Building, it remains unused and serves as a reminder of the ever-changing landscape of the city. The @CAPS2 Building's presence signifies the continued growth and evolution of New York, cementing its status as a global hub for architectural excellence.
1724	16557	6	3	The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State faced numerous obstacles. They had to modify and strengthen the building's frame, design a new tower, and address safety concerns due to the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in dirigibles. The shifting winds on top of the building and existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also posed challenges. By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quietly disappeared, giving way to airplanes as the transportation of the future.
1725	16558	6	3	"Many problems arised with the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building for that the engineers did not account. While the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind. ""... modifications had to be made"" (paragraph @NUM1). Though this obstacles was able to be overcome, many others were not. Since most dirigibles outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigibles could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg, and ""owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was a problem with a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried but neither could tether safely to the building. The thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the Empire State Building's top floors are now a public tourist spot. Although the vision of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building did not come to fruition, the building still stands as a testament to innovation and ambition in the realm of transportation and architecture."
1726	16559	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was because the dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. This posed a challenge as the existing structure was not designed to support the weight and forces exerted by a docking dirigible. Additionally, the strong winds at such heights could make docking and undocking a dangerous task. These factors required innovative solutions to be developed in order to safely accommodate dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Despite these challenges, the architects and engineers eventually found a way to construct a docking station for dirigibles, showcasing their determination and ingenuity in overcoming obstacles.
1727	16560	6	3	There were many obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building. First, new modifications would have to be added to the frame of the building because the previous frame could not hold the extra weight of a dirigible hanging from one cable. These additions would cost over sixty thousand dollars and require extra time and effort. Another significant problem was safety. Winds around New York were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which could cause the blimp to wrap around the tower and potentially break off. This risk was heightened by the densely populated city surroundings, where any accident could result in severe destruction. Additionally, foreign dirigibles often used large amounts of hydrogen, as seen in the Hindenburg disaster, which could lead to a massive flaming catastrophe if ignited. The chances of such an incident were increased by the unpredictable weather conditions, posing high risks to human life and property. Moreover, it was illegal for blimps to fly low near a city, making the entire project unlawful. The challenges surrounding a blimp docking center on the Empire State Building were numerous and complex, highlighting the impracticality of such an endeavor.
1728	16561	6	3	Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigibles could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable element, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develop. Another obstacle being faced was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible due to safety and legal concerns.
1729	16562	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted it is apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. The dirigibles themselves could be a hazard. ""... Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In likes of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown New York. Also, the dirigibles light mass would make it a target to high, forceful winds."" The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building ""... dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law thwarted many of the would-be attempts of mooring these. Mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in, ""The Mooring Mast,"" however that soon never had the chance to come true. This project faced numerous challenges, including the flammability of hydrogen in dirigibles, the susceptibility of dirigibles to high winds, and legal restrictions on airships flying too low over urban areas. Despite the dream of mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building, these obstacles ultimately prevented its realization."
1730	16563	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were numerous. The mast designed for the building, intended to be a dirigible docking station, posed significant challenges. Not only was it added solely to make the building the tallest in the world, but it also required modifications to the steel frame, costing a substantial amount of money. Additionally, the unpredictable winds at the building's height presented a constant problem, making it difficult to safely dock airships. The risks involved in having airships moored above a densely populated area like downtown New York further complicated the situation. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, adding another layer of complexity to the project. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building was ultimately completed, standing as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of challenges.
1731	16564	6	3	Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the United States use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constantly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship to swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem. Most importantly, there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles.
1732	16565	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building had to cross many obstacles in order to have a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building. They needed to build a mooring mast for the dirigible to dock on the Building. This presented another problem however because if dirigible docked on the building its weight would be to much for the building. They overcame this obstacle by reinforcing the building's supports. The largest obstacle and the one that defeated this idea of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was simply the elements. The violent air currents and high winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely tether itself to the top of the empire building. For example when the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los @CAPS2 tried to get in range of the mooring mast but was unable to, do to the fiercely forceful winds. In the end the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building could not overcome the obstacles. The dream of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building was ultimately dashed by the overpowering forces of nature.
1733	16566	6	3	Architects based in New York faced numerous challenges in their attempt to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. The idea was to have a docking station for dirigibles, allowing for refueling and passenger transfer. However, various obstacles prevented the project from coming to fruition.  One major issue was the structural integrity of the building itself. The weight and wind pressure of a moored dirigible would have put significant strain on the frame of the Empire State Building, requiring extensive modifications to the framework. Additionally, the completion of the building's roof was necessary before the mooring mast could even be considered.  Nature also posed a challenge, as violent air currents caused the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, making it difficult to secure. The idea of weighing down the craft with lead weights was deemed too risky. Furthermore, New York laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to approach the Empire State Building.  Ultimately, the mooring mast project was abandoned, and the rooms that were set aside for dirigibles were repurposed into a soda fountain and tea garden for tourists. With the rise of airplanes as the preferred mode of transportation by the late 1930s, the era of dirigibles had come to an end, leaving the Empire State Building's mooring mast as an unrealized dream.
1734	16567	6	3	Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult. The architects and builders had to consult with experts as to how this construction should take place and whether it was safe or not. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company. Perfusive planning and many meetings later they would begin building this mooring mast. As for the building the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building they had to find another way, they did not want to put stress on the buildings frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified requiring over sixty thousand dollars. Workers got to add the mast and then construction was halted due to danger of pedestrians, all that work for nothing. To avoid any potential risks, it was decided that the construction of the docking mast would be relocated to a safer area, ensuring the structural integrity of the Empire State Building while also providing a secure docking space for dirigibles.
1735	16568	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with immediate problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main hardship they encountered was placing a mooring mast on top of an already completed building. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, which was not designed for such a purpose. Additionally, high winds could cause the dirigible to sway dangerously, and the highly flammable gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne posed a significant fire hazard in a densely populated area like New York City. All of these factors ultimately led to the failure of the project to create a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1736	16569	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the shifting winds on top of the building, which could cause the dirigibles to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. This posed a risk to pedestrians and made docking challenging. Additionally, the safety concerns surrounding the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, as demonstrated by the tragic Hindenburg disaster, made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would be too risky for a densely populated area like downtown New York. These factors ultimately led to the decision to abandon plans for dirigible docking at the iconic skyscraper.
1737	16570	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to make such a miraculous, tall building. A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Over $1 million worth of changes had to be made to the framework. The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for dirigibles to land there. The dirigibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibiting the aircraft from flying so low. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully completed the construction of the iconic Empire State Building, a testament to human innovation and determination."
1738	16571	6	3	The builders of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles during its construction. One major concern was the idea of mooring a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, as this would put significant stress on the base of the frame. Additionally, the shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, posed a challenge as they could potentially cause the dirigible to swivel around. Furthermore, the use of hydrogen and helium, both highly flammable gases, raised concerns about the safety of such an endeavor. Despite these obstacles, the builders persevered and successfully constructed the iconic Empire State Building, a testament to human ingenuity and determination.
1739	16572	6	3	The empire State building had to face dangerous conditions every day like strong winds, heavy lifting, and working at high heights. These challenges require constant vigilance and expertise to ensure the safety of workers and the integrity of the structure. Despite these difficulties, the empire State building continues to stand as a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of adversity.
1740	16573	6	3	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. Ultimately, the risks posed by the highly flammable hydrogen used in dirigibles and the unpredictable nature of wind currents at such heights make docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building an unfeasible and unsafe endeavor."
1741	16574	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main issue was the safety concern, as most dirigibles used highly flammable gases like hydrogen. This posed a significant risk in case of a fire breaking out above New York City. Additionally, the builders had to contend with the challenges posed by nature, with violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building. These currents caused the backs of the ships to swivel around the mooring mast, creating potential hazards. Furthermore, there was a legal obstacle to overcome, as existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over cities. This made it illegal to tie up a dirigible to the Empire State Building. Overall, these challenges made it difficult for the builders to implement a dirigible docking system on the iconic skyscraper.
1742	16575	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existence, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. They also needed to find safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets to weigh down the ship. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite a lot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential. Despite the challenges faced, the Empire State Building remains an iconic symbol of New York City and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of its builders.
1743	16576	6	3	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are out lined. These obstacles were safety, nature, and law. Safety was an obstacle because the passengers on the dirigibles would be put in danger. This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past. Nature was an obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is un desirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone. There was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This law made it unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used. The obstacles outlined in the passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on something that wouldn't be profitable."
1744	16577	6	3	In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who designed the building, wanted to make it taller to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top, reaching 1,250 feet high. However, safety concerns were the primary reason why this idea was never implemented. The use of highly flammable hydrogen gas in dirigibles, as seen in the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, posed a significant risk in a densely populated area like New York City. Additionally, the unpredictable and powerful wind currents at such heights made it unsafe for dirigibles to navigate and dock securely. Moreover, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, further hindering the possibility of using the Empire State Building as a mooring mast. These challenges ultimately prevented the building from serving as a docking station for dirigibles, highlighting the practical and safety limitations that needed to be considered during its construction.
1745	16578	6	3	In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges while constructing a dock for dirigibles. One major concern was how to distribute the significant stress that would be placed on the building's structure, as mentioned in paragraph 1. Additionally, the safety of the city residents below was a critical issue. The possibility of a dirigible catching fire, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, posed a threat to pedestrians and surrounding buildings, as highlighted in paragraph 2. Ultimately, it was revealed that the dock was never intended for actual use but rather as a means to surpass the height of the Chrysler Building. These obstacles underscore the complexities faced by the builders in their ambitious construction project.
1746	16579	6	3	"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dirigible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so. As it stands, the risks associated with allowing a dirigible to dock outweigh the potential benefits, especially considering the flammability of hydrogen used in many dirigibles. Thus, until safer technology is developed, it is best to refrain from allowing dirigibles to dock in such locations."
1747	16580	6	3	"The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted discusses the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow airships to moor at the building. One major challenge was the constantly changing winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents. This made it difficult for airships to safely moor at the Empire State Building. Additionally, another obstacle the builders encountered was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would have made it illegal for airships to approach the Empire State Building for mooring purposes. These obstacles posed significant challenges for the builders as they worked to make the Empire State Building accessible for airships."
1748	16581	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The safety concerns surrounding the use of hydrogen in non-U.S. dirigibles, as exemplified by the Hindenburg disaster, posed a significant risk to the densely populated urban area below. Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of violent air currents at the building's altitude made docking and passenger transfer dangerous and challenging. Additionally, the use of lead weights to stabilize the dirigibles was not feasible at such heights. Laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas and approaching the building further hindered the potential of the mooring mast. Ultimately, these obstacles combined to prevent the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1749	16582	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to reinforce the building to handle the stress of a one thousand-foot dirigible with a single rope. Additionally, the flammability of hydrogen used in dirigibles posed a safety risk over a populated area. The high wind speeds at the top of the building also made it difficult to securely moor the dirigibles. Despite efforts to address architectural, safety, and environmental concerns, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building ultimately did not materialize.
1750	16583	6	3	"Al Smith had incredible vision with his plans for the Empire State Building. However, his excitement about dirigibles being allowed to dock at the top of the building, blinded him to the obvious obstacles in the way. Dirigibles themselves, were not safe modes of transportation. Hydrogen is very flammable, and would not be safe near large crowds of people, like in an urban area like New York. From a practical viewpoint the mooring mast would not work either, because of the high elevation. The height of the building would have violent winds @CAPS1 it difficult for dirigibles to land for passengers to disembark. The final major problem was that there was a law stating that airships were not to fly too low over urban areas. Irvan Clavan summed it up when he said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" However, technology soon made dirigibles outdated.  As technology advanced, it became clear that the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was no longer feasible. The safety concerns and logistical challenges associated with mooring airships at such heights were simply too great to overcome. Al Smith's vision, although ambitious, was ultimately impractical in the face of technological progress."
1751	16584	6	3	The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was safety. The sheer size of the dirigibles, some as long as one thousand feet, posed a significant risk in the busy New York City skyline. The constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents, further complicated the landing process. In addition, the method of tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast with lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street was deemed impractical and unsafe. These challenges made it clear that the dirigible landing on the mooring mast would never be a safe and feasible option.
1752	16585	6	3	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" The dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock. Additionally, the infrastructure and technology of the time were not advanced enough to ensure the safe and efficient docking of airships at mooring masts. These factors combined to make the use of mooring masts impractical and risky for airship travel."
1753	16586	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" Following the German dirigible Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over $10 million"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp. Due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the city below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Despite the challenges faced, the decision not to utilize the mast for dirigible docking ultimately prioritized safety and practicality in the construction of the iconic Empire State Building."
1754	16587	6	3	"The ability to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, while initially lucrative, had major obstacles. The problems facing the development of the mooring mast would be cost, flammability of dirigibles, and weather over @NUM1 feet in the air. The structural and cost problems facing Al Smith was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" In order to overcome this obstacle, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and... over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made."" This is problematic because Al Smith now must spend more time and money than originally planned. Furthermore, another problem is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion ""above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York"", would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people in harms way. Finally the weather at the top of the Empire State building is unsuitable for docking dirigibles: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This is dangerous to the structure of the building, surrounding buildings, and people close by. Due to these problems, Al Smith and the engineers could not complete the Mooring Mast. Additionally, the weight of the dirigibles could potentially cause structural damage to the building, further complicating the docking process. In conclusion, the challenges of cost, flammability, and weather conditions ultimately prevented the successful implementation of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building."
1755	16588	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether. Despite the initial vision, the challenges presented by safety concerns, nature, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the realization of dirigibles docking on the iconic Empire State Building."
1756	16589	6	3	Builders of the empire state building faced many different things while trying to build a dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to make sure it was safe to walk on the platform to get off the blimps. Also the dock had to be high so the owner could still keep the world's highest building record. But with a little hat added wasn't going to do much so building a dock was a better idea. The dock needed to be sturdy enough to support the weight of the dirigibles and the passengers disembarking from them. Additionally, it had to be designed in a way that would not compromise the structural integrity of the building itself. Despite these challenges, the builders were able to successfully construct a dock that met all of these requirements, allowing for safe and efficient transport to and from the empire state building.
1757	16590	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced various challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the building's structural integrity, as its steel was not strong enough to handle the pressure from the airship's weight. Additionally, the strong winds at the top of the building created turbulent air currents that could potentially push the dirigible into the building's edges. Furthermore, regulations prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for them to dock at the building. In order to make the building capable of accommodating an airship, an extra sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to strengthen its framework. Due to these obstacles, the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately not feasible.
1758	16591	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the morning mast on the Empire State Building posed challenges for builders trying to accommodate dirigibles. Erecting a structure of that height was difficult enough without adding a mast to it. Allowing dirigibles to land on the building was deemed hazardous, as demonstrated by the destruction of the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, which caused significant damage. The owners of the Empire State Building recognized the potential catastrophe if such an incident had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown. Consequently, the mast was installed but never utilized for dirigible landings. This decision was a prudent one, considering the risks involved in allowing dirigibles to land on the iconic skyscraper.
1759	16592	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their task of constructing a docking station for dirigibles. One major challenge was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building, caused by violent air currents. This made construction difficult as materials could easily be blown around. Additionally, the steel frame of the building had to be modified and reinforced to support the new docking station, adding to the complexity and length of the project. These obstacles required careful planning and attention to detail to ensure the safety of the workers and the successful completion of the project."
1760	16593	6	3	The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't put little waits on the back because if they ever fell they would @CAPS2 podestriens. And there was a law past ships couldnt dock on Building or even come close to rural areas. That is some of the obsticals the workers faced. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of wind patterns and weather conditions posed a challenge in securely docking the Dirigibles. The risk of potential harm to pedestrians in case of any mishaps further complicated the docking process. Moreover, strict regulations prohibiting ships from docking near buildings or rural areas added another layer of difficulty for the workers. Despite these challenges, the @CAPS1 persevered in finding innovative solutions to ensure the safe and efficient docking of the Dirigibles.
1761	16594	6	3	Technology was not caught up to the dirigibles. they could not dock because neither the building nor the dirigible had the right equipment and that was one of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced. This presented a challenge especially when they had to deliver newspapers. The inability to dock the dirigibles meant that alternative methods had to be devised for delivering the newspapers efficiently and on time. This technological limitation forced the builders to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to overcome this hurdle. Despite the obstacle, the Empire State building eventually became a symbol of progress and innovation, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of human ingenuity in the face of technological constraints.
1762	16595	6	3	"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" If the building was not strengthened, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced in the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying its safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, a really serious hazardous accident would ensue. Downtown New York is densely populated, and a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown in danger. Aside from the two obstacles explained above, nature poses another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is nowhere close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in a state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and collide with a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in successfully docking a dirigible."
1763	16596	6	3	The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the amount of problems that could have arisen. Balloons are not very strong and if they didn't already know, it's windy on the top of the Empire State Building. The wind Could drive the dirigible right into its spikey doom. They had no real way of keeping the dirigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. From 102 stories in the air, that wasn't the safest plan. Also, most non-rigid dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball like that would be devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable. The builders really should have planned this out better. The potential risks and dangers associated with the mooring mast were not adequately considered, posing serious threats to both the dirigibles and the surrounding area.
1764	16597	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building (@ORGANIZATION2) faced numerous obstacles when constructing the mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. High winds at the building's height posed a risk of causing damage to any docking blimps. Additionally, the flammability of the foreign airships, often filled with hydrogen, raised concerns about safety in a densely populated urban area like New York City. Moreover, existing airspace laws prohibited low-flying aircraft over such areas, further complicating the feasibility of the mooring mast. Ultimately, these factors combined to render the mooring mast project unsuccessful, leaving the Empire State Building with a redundant structure at its peak.
1765	16598	6	3	"The weight was an obstacle they faced. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified & strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The weight of the dirigible would be too heavy for the frame because the frame wasn't made for that much weight. Some dirigibles were highly flammable ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that it was too dangerous because it was located in a densely populated area. The air pressure was another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell...."" The last obstacle was the law. ""The other particular reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This law wouldn't allow dirigibles to land at the Empire State Building due to its location. Ultimately, the combination of weight, flammability, air pressure concerns, and legal restrictions made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the iconic Empire State Building."
1766	16599	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" That was struggle number one, a thousand-foot drigible would add too much stress to the frame. ""The stress of the drigibles load and as the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" That was another obstacle the builder's had to overcome considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below. The Empire State building then had to be strengthened and modified in order to build a stronger foundation for the mooring of a drigible upon the Empire State Building. Those were some of the many obstacles the builder's went through in designing the mast. The process of reinforcing the building to withstand the weight and wind pressure of a drigible was a complex and challenging task that required meticulous planning and engineering expertise. Despite these challenges, the builders were able to successfully modify the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring mast, showcasing their determination and innovation in overcoming obstacles to achieve their goal."
1767	16600	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced obstacles related to the strength of the frame. Dropping a mooring mast onto the flat roof would have stressed the frame too much, leading to over $60,000 worth of modifications to reinforce the building's framework. Unfortunately, the mooring mast was never able to fulfill its intended purpose due to these challenges."
1768	16601	6	3	The architects building the Empire State Building encountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. This meant that they would have to change the building's structure in order to make it work. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. These modifications were essential to ensure the safety and stability of the building, showing the dedication and determination of the architects to overcome challenges and create an iconic landmark that still stands tall today.
1769	16602	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building face a good amount of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock upon its mast. The wind proved to be a very big problem for the blimps. Not only would they swing about dangerously when tethered to the mast, but on the few occasions that a dirigible actually approached the Empire State building, they couldn't maneuver close enough due to the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another thing that stood in the way of the Empire State Building's dock being used was the danger it presented to the buildings and people below. The gas, hydrogen, that dirigibles used to float is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire,... the owners... realized how much worse the accident would have been... above a densely populated area."" The third and final obstacle they faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With all that potential danger and discouragement, it's no wonder the Empire State building was never used for docking dirigibles."
1770	16603	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. They had to contend with the challenge of mooring a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would add stress to the frame due to a single cable tether. Additionally, the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure had to be transmitted to the building's foundation, located nearly eleven hundred feet below. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Despite these obstacles, the builders were able to overcome these challenges and successfully incorporate a docking station for dirigibles at the top of the iconic skyscraper.
1771	16604	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in making a dirigible docking station. One of the main challenges was the law prohibiting low-flying aircraft in urban areas like New York City. Additionally, docking a massive blimp at almost a hundred feet high would expose it to violent winds, increasing the risk of it getting tangled with the mast. Moreover, the use of hydrogen-filled foreign blimps posed a serious safety concern due to the high flammability of the gas. Any accident involving fire, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, could have catastrophic consequences in a densely populated city like New York. To support the docking station, the building's frame needed reinforcement to withstand the additional stress. Overall, the construction of a dirigible docking station at the Empire State Building presented significant safety and structural challenges that had to be carefully addressed.
1772	16605	6	3	In the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building, builders faced numerous obstacles. One challenge was how to modify the building to support a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top, as it would add excessive stress to the frame. Additionally, the cost of over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications presented a financial hurdle. Safety was a crucial concern, especially with the use of highly flammable hydrogen in dirigibles outside the United States. Given New York City's dense population, the risk of using hydrogen was deemed too high. Furthermore, the constantly shifting winds and the law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas posed significant safety risks and legal barriers to the project. Ultimately, the mooring mast was never completed due to these insurmountable challenges.
1773	16606	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didn't interfere with the building. Also, another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. Because if a blimp got too close to an urban city like @CAPS1.Y and had all those flammable fuels leak out, it would be a big disaster. These are the obstacles the builders faced. Additionally, ensuring the structural integrity of the mooring mast and designing it to withstand the forces exerted by docking airships was another challenge. The builders had to carefully plan and construct a strong and stable structure that could safely accommodate airship landings and departures. By overcoming these obstacles and implementing effective safety measures, the builders were able to successfully incorporate a mooring mast into the design of the Empire State Building, allowing for the possibility of airship docking at this iconic skyscraper."
1774	16607	6	3	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large dirigible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used. Additionally, the sheer size of the dirigible in comparison to the building posed a significant risk of collision and damage to the structure. Overall, the challenges and dangers associated with mooring a dirigible at the Empire State building were insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the idea."
1775	16608	6	3	When designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building, there were obstacles that the engineers and architects were faced with. One problem was they couldn't drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building because it was too heavy for the frame of the building. So, because of that problem, the engineers had to come up with a way to modify the frame of the building so that it could withstand the added stress of the mooring mast. Another issue they encountered was that it was too dangerous. This was due to the fact that most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. They couldn't risk having a disaster like the Hindenburg happening 102 floors above city streets crowded with people. These were a few obstacles that the engineers faced when building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.
1776	16609	6	3	The @CAPS1 says the greatest obstacle would be nature itself. The wind would blow the blimps onto the sharp spires of other buildings. In addition, unpredictable weather conditions could further complicate the safe navigation of blimps through urban landscapes. These challenges highlight the need for careful planning and consideration of environmental factors when deploying blimps in built-up areas. Despite their potential benefits, such as reduced traffic congestion and emissions, blimps must overcome these natural obstacles to become a viable transportation option in urban environments.
1777	16610	6	3	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly too low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe. Additionally, the lack of proper infrastructure and technology at the time would have made it difficult to ensure the safe landing and takeoff of dirigibles from the building. Overall, the numerous safety concerns and regulatory restrictions made the idea of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station too risky and impractical.
1778	16611	6	3	After finishing the Empire State Building, architects wanted to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems they had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was that most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and after the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, architects feared a similar catastrophe could happen in New York City, but with many more casualties. Another issue was the high winds at the top of the building, making it almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady for mooring. Additionally, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building due to the lack of stabilization at the front and back. The third problem was the existence of a law prohibiting the flying of dirigibles at the necessary height to moor on the Empire State Building. These combined factors made it impossible for dirigibles to successfully moor on the iconic skyscraper.
1779	16612	6	3	There were many obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, requiring over $1 million for strengthening and modification. Safety was the greatest concern, as dirigibles are flammable due to their helium content. Additionally, the swaying of a dirigible mounted on the building could lead to a potential crash into a densely populated area. These factors highlight the challenges involved in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1780	16613	6	3	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle that the builders had overcome was the law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project was shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles. The challenges of the law and the unpredictable wind currents ultimately led to the abandonment of the mooring mast project at the Empire State Building."
1781	16614	6	3	To design a mast for the dirigibles to land was no easy matter architects could not just plop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The stress from a thousand-foot dirigible would transmit weight and wind pressure all the way to the foundation. To be able to create this mast, the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened. First, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. This rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners of aluminum and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery. Finally, when this was all completed, the existing plans for the building were put in place.
1782	16615	6	3	"There were many obstacles which the builders of the mooring mast had to face. They thought it was going to be an easy task to accomplish as shown in paragraph eight where Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and he responded ""[It's] on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" This shows how truly sure Smith was about the goal's simplicity.  Although determination was a great factor in the building of this world wide known monument, problems kept standing in the way of success. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the author describes how the Empire State building would not be able to fulfill it's purpose, even though workers should've known better. She states ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 kept pooring down, one of them being nature.  Finally the workers gave up after the project was postpone due to mainly safety reasons. By the late 1930's, the idea of the mooring mast had almost disappeared. All that really matters is that they tried, and all it took was just one dream. The mooring mast stands as a testament to the determination of those who dared to dream and strive for the impossible, even in the face of insurmountable challenges."
1783	16616	6	3	Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (L¸sted, @NUM1). The builders would have to keep this in mind. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (L¸sted, @NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area (L¸sted, @NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. However, with careful planning and consideration of these obstacles, the Empire State Building eventually became a symbol of architectural ingenuity and innovation in the heart of New York City.
1784	16617	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety, nature, and law in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The issue of safety became apparent because most dirigibles made outside of the United States were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. To risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating. Nature too became a problem in the futile attempt of the builders. With such violent air currents, the dirigible would swivel around even if it were tied up to the mooring mast. Finally, law was an obstacle to the builders. Existing legislation banned airships from flying too low over urban areas, meaning the dirigibles would have no way of landing atop the urban building. These obstacles proved to be insurmountable for the builders, ultimately preventing the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
1785	16618	6	3	In the @CAPS1, the docking of dirigibles had many issues. One, boarding passengers would be very difficult as the dirigible will @CAPS2 from a gust of wind. Second, the gases used to make afloat are highly flammable, and explode quite easily. This made the docking process extremely risky and dangerous, posing a significant threat to both passengers and crew members. Furthermore, the volatile nature of these gases made it challenging to ensure the safety of the dirigible while it was docked, adding another layer of complexity to the already precarious situation. Despite the convenience and novelty of using dirigibles for transportation, these inherent risks and challenges associated with docking ultimately hindered their widespread adoption and success in the @CAPS1.
1786	16619	6	3	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to have dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a huge safety issue; ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flamible"" if an accident happened (lets say to the magnitude of the Hindenburg) over New York City, thousands of people could die because of this highly flamible substance. Secondly a very large problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building work constantly shifting due to air currents"". If the wind was out of controll and the dirigible wasn't tied down right, the harsh winds could be dangerously dangeling over the people of New York. Amongst many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have ever been thought of as a reality. The risks and potential hazards associated with docking dirigibles at the empire state building far outweigh any potential benefits, making it an impractical and dangerous idea."
1787	16620	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, you learn about the plans for the Empire State Building but, you also learn why the Mooring Mast cannot be used for its original purpose. The Mooring Mast was planned to be used as a docking station for dirigibles, or blimps. One reason why the Mooring Mast could not dock these is because places outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Most dirigibles outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another reason why it would not work was violent air currents. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be whirled around the mooring mast. With that problem, they would have to worry about the mast being taken out. The last reason is because of a law. An existing law against airships flying too lower over urban areas. The building mast was too close to humans to let them dock there. While the mast was a brilliant idea, it could not be done now, it is only a dream.
1788	16621	6	3	The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to dock dirigibles at the top of the structure. The strong winds near the pinnacle of the building posed a significant problem, as they made it difficult for airship captains to maneuver their vessels effectively. Additionally, the densely populated streets below the building raised concerns about the potential for a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy, which could result in a high number of casualties in New York City. Furthermore, existing laws prohibited airships from flying over urban areas at the necessary height for docking on the building's mast. These obstacles ultimately made it unlikely that the builders would be able to realize their vision of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles.
1789	16622	6	3	The Empire State Building faced obstacles related to weight and nature during the construction of its mooring mast. The weight of a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would have added stress to the frame, requiring the transmission of this load to the foundation nearly 1,000 feet below. Additionally, the shifting winds on top of the building posed a challenge to successfully using the mooring mast. The violent air currents caused the back of the ship to swivel around the mast, further complicating the mooring process. These obstacles highlight the complexities involved in designing and implementing such a structure on top of the iconic Empire State Building.
1790	16623	6	3	The architects faced various obstacles during the process of incorporating a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They had to rebuild the entire frame of the building to accommodate this new addition, as simply placing a mooring mast on the flat roof was not feasible. Additionally, the flammability of hydrogen gas, highlighted by a previous dirigible accident, raised concerns about the safety of such a setup in a densely populated area like New York City. Moreover, the unpredictable and violent air currents on top of the building posed a challenge, as traditional methods of stabilizing a dirigible were not suitable for this urban environment. Despite these obstacles, the architects persevered and found innovative solutions to ensure the successful integration of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.
1791	16624	6	3	"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. for example it would have been almost impossible to dock with the violent winds blowing at that height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". It would not have been @CAPS2 to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the law of airships flying too low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" That's saying that even if a dirigible could moor at the Empire State Building, It's illegal because all airships have to fly a certain height over urban area. The workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were just too great to overcome. Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will."
1792	16625	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast. One of the main challenges was the complexity of securely tying down the blimp without causing it to spin uncontrollably or damage the building's foundation. Additionally, there were concerns about the safety of such a docking system and whether it was even permissible. Another significant obstacle was the fact that dirigibles were too low to the ground to dock properly and were primarily filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas, posing a serious risk. Despite the hard work put into the project, Al Smith and his team had to prioritize the safety and well-being of the people of New York above all else.
1793	16626	6	3	"Dirigibles are large steel-frame balloons enclosed by cotton and filled with hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930's, the new idea came about that the dirigibles would dock at the top of the Empire State Building in New York. After reading The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we have learned of the obstacles the builders were faced with. The author notes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The dirigibles would constantly be moving and shifting. The author also states, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law was set in place for safety reasons. Due to the two main obstacles; nature and law, builders, wern't able to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Despite the innovative idea, the challenges presented by the unpredictable nature of air currents and existing safety regulations ultimately prevented the realization of mooring dirigibles at the iconic Empire State Building."
1794	16627	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant challenges in their goal to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety concerns were paramount, as dirigibles are filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas, posing a serious risk to passengers and pedestrians below. The Hindenburg disaster in 1937 highlighted the potential catastrophic consequences of such a setup in a densely populated city like New York.  Furthermore, natural elements such as air currents presented a major obstacle. The constant shifting of the dirigible on top of the building would require weights to stabilize it, further endangering those below. Additionally, existing laws prohibited dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building, making the idea even more unfeasible.  In conclusion, the concept of allowing dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was not only impractical but also legally impossible. The safety risks and regulatory barriers made it clear that this plan was unviable.
1795	16628	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there like nature, law, and of the sharp spire. Nature was proably the biggest problem because you can't control wind. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building were so strong cause ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."" This would make it hard to land and unland the dirigibles. Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it. If a dirigible was to hit it it would pop the dirigible and kill many people below."
1796	16629	6	3	The obstacle faced by the builders when constructing the building was the challenge of accommodating the landing of the large dirigibles in a convenient manner. The immense size of the dirigibles, equivalent to four blocks of New York City, posed a significant problem as they traveled at a rapid speed of eight miles per hour. This hindered the builders as the building itself was also substantial in size, making it difficult to find a suitable landing space for the dirigibles. Additionally, the builders encountered time constraints as they had to allocate time for consultations with engineers and experts, as well as meetings with architects and presidents. This delay in construction progress impeded the timely completion of the building. When faced with obstacles such as accommodating the landing of large dirigibles and managing time constraints, building a structure of considerable height and width becomes a challenging task.
1797	16630	6	3	In addition to the challenges posed by natural causes such as high winds, the construction of docking dirigibles also faced the issue of highly flammable hydrogen gases being used for flight. This posed a significant safety risk, especially considering that the project was taking place in a densely populated area. Any accidents or malfunctions could potentially result in harm to civilians in the vicinity. These factors further complicated the already complex process of constructing and operating docking dirigibles.
1798	16631	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the violent winds at high altitudes that made it difficult for the blimps to dock safely. The winds were constantly shifting, posing a risk to the people onboard. Additionally, it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building, making it challenging to establish a docking system. Moreover, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles made it dangerous to dock, as hydrogen is highly flammable. As a result, the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building became more of an attraction for sightseers than a practical docking station for dirigibles.
1799	16632	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Despite this restriction, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the idea was ultimately abandoned. This challenge posed a significant hurdle for the construction of the iconic Empire State Building, requiring the builders to find alternative methods for transportation and access to the site. Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building was successfully completed and remains a symbol of architectural and engineering achievement.
1800	16633	6	3	"You want me to tell you what they had to go through in attempt to allow dirigibles dock there?! Well to tell you the truth they had to go through a lot, like ""one obstacle the lack of a suitable landing area"", also another ""obstacle I would have to say is nature""! let me tell you why I picked these to obstacles. Keep reading! They want to dock the dirigibles at the empire state building. I say want because there plan did not work to many things was wrong. like the fact that they said ""one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing"" they couldnt find a good landing area for the dirigibles with out something bad happening. another ""obstacle they had was nature"" I say nature because if the wind blew it can blow away some people. So those are my main obstacles that they had to go through @CAPS1 to allow the dirigibles dock there."
